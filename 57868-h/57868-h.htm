<p>During the thirty-five years which have elapsed since the first
edition of this work was issued, a greater advance has probably
been made in the political and intellectual development of China
than within any previous century of her history. While neither
the social habits nor principles of government have so far altered
as to necessitate a complete rewriting of these pages, it will be
found, nevertheless, that the present volumes treat of a reformed
and in many respects modern nation. Under the new régime
the central administration has radically increased its authority
among the provincial rulers, and more than ever in former
years has managed to maintain control over their pretentions.
The Empire has, moreover, established its foreign relations on a
well-understood basis by accredited envoys; this will soon affect
the mass of the people by the greater facilities of trade, the
presence of travellers, diffusion of education, and other agencies
which are awaking the people from their lethargy. Already
the influences which will gradually transform the face of society
are mightily operating.</p>

<p>The changes which have been made in the book comprise
such alterations and additions as were necessary to describe the
country under its new aspects. In the constant desire to preserve
a convenient size, every doubtful or superfluous sentence
has been erased, while the new matter incorporated has increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the bulk of the present edition about one-third. The arrangement
of chapters is the same. The first four, treating of the
geography, combine as many and accurate details of recent explorers
or residents as the proportions of this section will permit.
The extra-provincial regions are described from the researches
of Russian, English, and Indian travellers of the last twenty
years. It is a waste, mountainous territory for the most part
and can never support a large population. Great pains have
been taken by the cartographer, Jacob Wells, to consult the most
authentic charts in the construction of the map of the Empire.
By collating and reducing to scale the surveys and route charts
of reliable travellers throughout the colonies, he has produced in
all respects as accurate a map of Central Asia as is at this date
possible. The Eighteen Provinces are in the main the same as
in my former map.</p>

<p>The chapter on the census remains for the most part without
alteration, for until there has been a methodical inspection of
the Empire, important questions concerning its population must
be held in abeyance. It is worth noticing how generally the
estimates in this chapter&mdash;or much larger figures&mdash;have since
its first publication been accepted for the population of China.
Foreign students of natural history in China have, by their researches
in every department, furnished material for more extensive
and precise descriptions under this subject than could
possibly have been gathered twoscore years ago. The sixth
chapter has, therefore, been almost wholly rewritten, and embraces
as complete a summary of this wide field as space would
allow or the general reader tolerate. The specialist will, however,
speedily recognize the fact that this rapid glance serves rather
to indicate how immense and imperfectly explored is this subject
than to describe whatever is known.</p>

<p>That portion of the first volume treating of the laws and
their administration does not admit of more than a few minor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
changes. However good their theory of jurisprudence, the
people have many things to bear from the injustice of their
rulers, but more from their own vices. The <cite>Peking Gazette</cite> is
now regularly translated in the Shanghai papers, and gives a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’œil</i> of the administration of the highest value.</p>

<p>The chapters on the languages and literature are considerably
improved. The translations and text-books which the diligence
of foreign scholars has recently furnished could be only partially
enumerated, though here, as elsewhere in the work, references
in the foot-notes are intended to direct the more interested
student to the bibliography of the subject, and present
him with the materials for an exhaustive study. The native
literature is extensive, and all branches have contributed somewhat
to form the résumé which is contained in this section,
giving a preponderance to the Confucian classics. The four
succeeding chapters contain notices of the arts, industries, domestic
life, and science of the Chinese&mdash;a necessarily rapid survey,
since these features of Chinese life are already well understood
by foreigners. Nothing, however, that is either original or
peculiar has been omitted in the endeavor to portray their
social and economic characteristics. The emigration of many
thousands of the people of Kwangtung within the last thirty
years has made that province a representative among foreign
nations of the others; it may be added that its inhabitants are
well fitted, by their enterprise, thrift, and maritime habits, to
become types of the whole.</p>

<p>The history and chronology are made fuller by the addition
of several facts and tables;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but the field of research in this
direction has as yet scarcely been defined, and few certain
dates have been determined prior to the Confucian era.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
The entire continent of Asia must be thoroughly investigated
in its geography, antiquities, and literature in order to throw
light on the eastern portion. The history of China offers an
interesting topic for a scholar who would devote his life to its
elucidation from the mass of native literature.</p>

<p>The two chapters on the religions, and what has been done
within the past half century to promote Christian missions, are
somewhat enlarged and brought down to the present time. The
study of modern scholars in the examination of Chinese religious
beliefs has enabled them to make comparisons with other
systems of Asiatics, as well as discuss the native creeds with
more certainty.</p>

<p>The chapter on the commerce of China has an importance
commensurate with its growing amount. Within the past ten
years the opium trade has been attacked in its moral and commercial
bearings between China, India, and England. There
are grounds for hope that the British Government will free
itself from any connection with it, which will be a triumph of
justice and Christianity. The remainder of Volume II. describes
events in the intercourse of China with the outer world, including
a brief account of the Tai-ping Rebellion, which proximately
grew out of foreign ideas. No connected or satisfactory narrative
of the events which have forced one of the greatest nations
of the world into her proper position, so far as I am aware, has
as yet been prepared. A succinct recital of one of the most
extraordinary developments of modern times should not be without
interest to all.</p>

<p>The work of condensing the vast increase of reliable information
upon China into these two volumes has been attended
with considerable labor. Future writers will, I am convinced,
after the manner of Richthofen, Yule, Legge, and others, confine
themselves to single or cognate subjects rather than attempt
such a comprehensive synopsis as is here presented. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
number of illustrations in this edition is nearly doubled, the
added ones being selected with particular reference to the subject-matter.
I have availed myself of whatever sources of
information I could command, due acknowledgment of which
is made in the foot-notes, and ample references in the Index.</p>

<p>The revision of this book has been the slow though constant
occupation of several years. When at last I had completed the
revised copy and made arrangements as to its publication, in
March, 1882, my health failed, and under a partial paralysis I
was rendered incapable of further labor. My son, Frederick
Wells Williams, who had already looked over the copy, now assumed
entire charge of the publication. I had the more confidence
that he would perform the duties of editor, for he had already
a general acquaintance with China and the books which are the
best authority. The work has been well done, the last three
chapters particularly having been improved under his careful
revision and especial study of the recent political history of
China. The Index is his work, and throughout the book I am
indebted to his careful supervision, especially on the chapters
treating of geography and literature. By the opening of this
year I had so far recovered as to be able to superintend the
printing and look over the proofs of the second volume.</p>

<p>My experiences in the forty-three years of my life in China
were coeval with the changes which gradually culminated in
the opening of the country. Among the most important of
these may be mentioned the cessation of the East India Company
in 1834, the war with England in 1841-42, the removal
of the monopoly of the hong merchants, the opening of five
ports to trade, the untoward attack on the city of Canton which
grew out of the lorcha Arrow, the operations in the vicinity of
Peking, the establishment of foreign legations in that city, and
finally, in 1873, the peaceful settlement of the <i>kotow</i>, which rendered
possible the approach of foreign ministers to the Em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>peror’s
presence. Those who trace the hand of God in history
will gather from such rapid and great changes in this Empire
the foreshadowing of the fulfilment of his purposes; for while
these political events were in progress the Bible was circulating,
and the preaching and educational labors of missionaries were
silently and with little opposition accomplishing their leavening
work among the people.</p>

<p>On my arrival at Canton in 1833 I was officially reported,
with two other Americans, to the hong merchant Kingqua as
<i>fan-kwai</i>, or ‘foreign devils,’ who had come to live under his
tutelage. In 1874, as Secretary of the American Embassy at
Peking, I accompanied the Hon. B. P. Avery to the presence
of the Emperor Tungchí, when the Minister of the United
States presented his letters of credence on a footing of perfect
equality with the ‘Son of Heaven.’ With two such experiences
in a lifetime, and mindful of the immense intellectual
and moral development which is needed to bring an independent
government from the position of forcing one of them to
that of yielding the other, it is not strange that I am assured of
a great future for the sons of Han; but the progress of pure
Christianity will be the only adequate means to save the conflicting
elements involved in such a growth from destroying
each other. Whatever is in store for them, it is certain that
the country has passed its period of passivity. There is no
more for China the repose of indolence and seclusion&mdash;when
she looked down on the nations in her overweening pride like
the stars with which she could have no concern.</p>

<p>In this revision the same object has been kept in view that is
stated in the Preface to the first edition&mdash;to divest the Chinese
people and civilization of that peculiar and indefinable impression
of ridicule which has been so generally given them by
foreign authors. I have endeavored to show the better traits
of their national character, and that they have had up to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
time no opportunity of learning many things with which they
are now rapidly becoming acquainted. The time is speedily
passing away when the people of the Flowery Land can fairly
be classed among uncivilized nations. The stimulus which in
this labor of my earlier and later years has been ever present to
my mind is the hope that the cause of missions may be promoted.
In the success of this cause lies the salvation of China
as a people, both in its moral and political aspects. This success
bids fair to keep pace with the needs of the people. They
will become fitted for taking up the work themselves and joining
in the multiform operations of foreign civilizations. Soon
railroads, telegraphs, and manufactures will be introduced, and
these must be followed by whatsoever may conduce to enlightening
the millions of the people of China in every department
of religious, political, and domestic life.</p>

<p>The descent of the Holy Spirit is promised in the latter times,
and the preparatory work for that descent has been accomplishing
in a vastly greater ratio than ever before, and with increased
facilities toward its final completion. The promise of that Spirit
will fulfil the prophecy of Isaiah, delivered before the era of
Confucius, and God’s people will come from the land of Sinim
and join in the anthem of praise with every tribe under the
sun.</p>

<i>Toork</i>, <i>Beloor</i>, <i>koo</i>, <i>soong</i>. This sound is heard less full

<li>13. <i>ia</i> as in <i>ya</i>rd; e.g., <i>hia</i>, <i>kiang</i>; not to be sounded as if written
<i>high-a</i>, <i>kigh-ang</i>, but like <i>heä</i>, <i>keäng</i>.</li>

<li>14. <i>iau</i> is made by joining Nos. 5 and 11; <i>hiau</i>, <i>Liautung</i>.</li>

<li>15. <i>ie</i> as in s<i>ie</i>rra (Spanish), R<i>ie</i>nzi; e.g., <i>hien</i>, <i>kien</i>.</li>

<li>16. <i>iu</i> as in p<i>ew</i>, p<i>u</i>re, lengthened to a diphthong; <i>kiu</i>, <i>siun</i>.</li>

<li>17. <i>iue</i> is made by adding a short <i>e</i> to the preceding; <i>kiuen</i>, <i>hiuen</i>.</li>

<li>18. <i>ui</i> as in L<i>oui</i>siana, s<i>ui</i>cide; e.g., <i>sui</i>, <i>chui</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The consonants are sounded generally as they are in the English
alphabet. <i>Ch</i> as in <i>ch</i>urch; <i>hw</i> as in <i>wh</i>en; <i>j</i> soft, as <i>s</i> in plea<i>s</i>ure;
<i>kw</i> as in aw<i>kw</i>ard; <i>ng</i>, as an initial, as in si<i>nging</i>, leaving off
the first two letters; <i>sz’</i> and <i>tsz’</i> are to be sounded full with one
breathing, but none of the English vowels are heard in it; the
sound stops at the <i>z</i>; Dr. Morrison wrote these sounds <i>tsze</i> and <i>sze</i>,
while Sir Thomas Wade, whose system bids fair to become the
most widely employed, turns them into <i>ssŭ</i> and <i>tzŭ</i>. The <i>hs</i> of the
latter, made by omitting the first vowel of <i>hissing</i>, is written simply
as <i>h</i> by the author. <i>Urh</i>, or <i>’rh</i>, is pronounced as the three last letters
of <i>purr</i>.</p>

<p>All these, except No. 12, are heard in the court dialect, which
has now become the most common mode of writing the names of
places and persons in China. Though foreign authors have employed
different letters, they have all intended to write the same
sound; thus <i>chan</i>, <i>shan</i>, and <i>xan</i>, are only different ways of writing
閂; and <i>tsse</i>, <i>tsze</i>, <i>tsz’</i>, <i>𝔷h</i>, <i>tzŭ</i>, and <i>tzu</i>, of 字. Such is not the case,
however, with such names as <i>Macao</i>, <i>Hongkong</i>, <i>Amoy</i>, <i>Whampoa</i>,
and others along the coast, which are sounded according to the
local patois, and not the court pronunciation&mdash;<i>Ma-ngau</i>, <i>Hiangkiang</i>,
<i>Hiamun</i>, <i>Hwangpu</i>, etc. Many of the discrepancies seen in the
works of travellers and writers are owing to the fact that each is
prone to follow his own fancy in transliterating foreign names;
uniformity is almost unattainable in this matter. Even, too, in
what is called the court dialect there is a great diversity among
educated Chinese, owing to the traditional way all learn the sounds
of the characters. In this work, and on the map, the sounds are
written uniformly according to the pronunciation given in Morrison’s
Dictionary, but not according to his orthography. Almost
every writer upon the Chinese language seems disposed to propose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
a new system, and the result is a great confusion in writing the
same name; for example, <i>eull</i>, <i>olr</i>, <i>ul</i>, <i>ulh</i>, <i>lh</i>, <i>urh</i>, <i>’rh</i>, <i>í</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>lur</i>, <i>nge</i>,
<i>ngí</i>, <i>je</i>, <i>jí</i>, are different ways of writing the sounds given to a single
character. Amid these discrepancies, both among the Chinese
themselves and those who endeavor to catch their pronunciation,
it is almost impossible to settle upon one mode of writing the names
of places. That which seems to offer the easiest pronunciation
has been adopted in this work. It may, perhaps, be regarded as an
unimportant matter, so long as the place is known, but to one living
abroad, and unacquainted with the language, the discrepancy
is a source of great confusion. He is unable to decide, for instance,
whether <i>Tung-ngan</i>, <i>Tungon hien</i>, <i>Tang-oune</i>, and <i>Tungao</i>, refer to
the same place or not.</p>

<p>In writing Chinese proper names, authors differ greatly as to the
style of placing them; thus, Fuhchaufu, Fuh-chau-fu, Fuh Chau
Fu, Fuh-Chau fu, etc., are all seen. Analogy affords little guide
here, for New York, Philadelphia, and Cambridge are severally
unlike in the principle of writing them: the first, being really
formed of an adjective and a noun, is not in this case united to the
latter, as it is in Newport, Newtown, etc.; the second is like the
generality of Chinese towns, and while it is now written as one
word, it would be written as two if the name were translated&mdash;as
‘Brotherly Love;’ but the third, <i>Cambridge</i>, despite its derivation,
is never written in two words, and many Chinese names are like
this in origin. Thus applying these rules, properly enough, to
Chinese places, they have been written here as single words, <i>Suchau</i>,
<i>Peking</i>, <i>Hongkong</i>; a hyphen has been inserted in some places
only to avoid mispronunciation, as <i>Hiau-í</i>, <i>Sí-ngan</i>, etc. It is hardly
supposed that this system will alter such names as are commonly
written otherwise, nor, indeed, that it will be adhered to with absolute
consistency in the following pages; but the principle of the
arrangement is perhaps the simplest possible. The additions <i>fu</i>,
<i>chau</i>, <i>ting</i>, and <i>hien</i>, being classifying terms, should form a separate
word. In conclusion, it may be stated that this system could only
be carried out approximately as regards the proper names in the
colonies and outside of the Empire.</p>

<span class="smaller">GENERAL DIVISIONS AND FEATURES OF THE EMPIRE.</span></h2>


<p>The possessions of the ruling dynasty of China,&mdash;that portion
of the Asiatic continent which is usually called by geographers
the <span class="smcap">Chinese Empire</span>,&mdash;form one of the most extensive
dominions ever swayed by a single power in any age, or any
part of the world. Comprising within its limits every variety
of soil and climate, and watered by large rivers, which serve
not only to irrigate and drain it, but, by means of their size
and the course of their tributaries, affording unusual facilities
for intercommunication, it produces within its own borders
everything necessary for the comfort, support, and delight of
its occupants, who have depended very slightly upon the
assistance of other climes and nations for satisfying their own
wants. Its civilization has been developed under its own institutions;
its government has been modelled without knowledge
or reference to that of any other kingdom; its literature has
borrowed nothing from the genius or research of the scholars
of other lands; its language is unique in its symbols, its structure,
and its antiquity; its inhabitants are remarkable for their
industry, peacefulness, numbers, and peculiar habits. The examination
of such a people, and so extensive a country, can
hardly fail of being both instructive and entertaining, and if
rightly pursued, lead to a stronger conviction of the need of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
precepts and sanctions of the Bible to the highest development
of every nation in its personal, social, and political relations in
this world, as well as to individual happiness in another. It is
to be hoped, too, that at this date in the world’s history, there
are many more than formerly, who desire to learn the condition
and wants of others, not entirely for their own amusement and
congratulation at their superior knowledge and advantages, but
also to promote the well-being of their fellow-men, and impart
liberally of the gifts they themselves enjoy. Those who desire
to do this, will find that few families of mankind are more
worthy of their greatest efforts than those comprised within the
limits of the Chinese Empire; while none stand in more need
of the purifying, ennobling, and invigorating principles of our
holy religion to develop and enforce their own theories of social
improvement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF THE NAME CHINA.</div>

<p>The origin of the name <i>China</i> has not yet been fully settled.
The people themselves have now no such name for their country,
nor is there good evidence that they ever did apply it to
the whole land. The occurrence in the <cite>Laws of Manu</cite> and in
the <cite>Mahâbhârata</cite> of the name <i>China</i>, applied to a land or people
with whom the Hindus had intercourse in the twelfth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and who were probably the Chinese, throws the origin far
back into the remotest times, where probability must take the
place of evidence. The most credible account ascribes its
origin to the family of Tsin, whose chief first obtained complete
sway, about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 250, over all the other feudal principalities in
the land, and whose exploits rendered him famous in India,
Persia, and other Asiatic states. His sept had, however, long
been renowned in Chinese history, and previous to this conquest
had made itself widely known, not only in China, but in other
countries. The kingdom lay in the northwestern parts of the
empire, near the Yellow River, and according to Visdelou, who
has examined the subject, the family was illustrious by its
nobility and power. “Its founder was Tayé, son of the emperor
Chuen-hü. It existed in great splendor for more than a
thousand years, and was only inferior to the royal dignity.
Feitsz’, a prince of this family, had the superintendence of the
stud of the emperor Hiao, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 909, and as a mark of favor his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
majesty conferred on him the sovereignty of the city of Tsinchau
in <i>mesne tenure</i>, with the title of sub-tributary king. One
hundred and twenty-two years afterwards, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 770, Siangkwan,
<i>petit roi</i> of Tsinchau (having by his bravery revenged the
insults offered to the emperor Ping by the Tartars, who slew
his father Yu), was created king in full tenure, and without limitation
or exception. The same monarch, abandoning Sí-ngan
(then called Hao-king, the capital of his empire) to transport
his seat to Lohyang, Siangkwan was able to make himself
master of the large province of Shensí, which had composed
the proper kingdom of the emperor. The king of Tsin thus
became very powerful, but though his fortune changed, he did
not alter his title, retaining always that of the city of Tsinchau,
which had been the foundation of his elevation. The kingdom
of Tsin soon became celebrated, and being the place of the first
arrival by land of people from western countries, it seems probable
that those who saw no more of China than the realm of
Tsin, extended this name to all the rest, and called the whole
empire Tsin or Chin.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This extract refers to periods long before the dethronement
of the house of Chau by princes of Tsin; the position of this
latter principality, contiguous to the desert, and holding the
passes leading from the valley of the Tarim across the desert
eastward to China, renders the supposition of the learned
Jesuit highly probable. The possession of the old imperial
capital would strengthen this idea in the minds of the traders
resorting to China from the West; and when the same family
did obtain paramount sway over the whole empire, and its head
render himself celebrated by his conquests, and by building
the Great Wall, the name Tsin was still more widely diffused,
and regarded as the name of the country. The Malays and
Arabians, whose vessels were early found between Aden and
Canton, knew it as China, and probably introduced the name
into Europe before 1500. The Hindus contracted it into <i>Ma-chin</i>,
from <i>Maha-china</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Great China;’ and the first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
these was sometimes confounded with <i>Manji</i>, a term used for
the tribes in Yunnan. Thus it appears that these and other
nations of Asia have known the country or its people by no
other terms than <i>Jin</i>, <i>Chin</i>, <i>Sin</i>, <i>Sinæ</i>, or <i>Tzinistæ</i>. The Persian
name <i>Cathay</i>, and its Russian form of <i>Kitai</i>, is of modern
origin; it is altered from <i>Ki-tah</i>, the race which ruled northern
China in the tenth century, and is quite unknown to the people
it designates. The Latin word <i>Seres</i> is derived from the
Chinese word <i>sz’</i> (silk), and doubtless first came into use to
denote the people during the Han dynasty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIOUS DESIGNATIONS.</div>

<p>The Chinese have many names to designate themselves and
the land they inhabit. One of the most ancient is <i>Tien Hia</i>,
meaning ‘Beneath the Sky,’ and denoting the World; another,
almost as ancient, is <i>Sz’ Hai</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘[all within] the Four Seas,’
while a third is <i>Chung Kwoh</i>, or ‘Middle Kingdom.’ This
dates from the establishment of the Chau dynasty, about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
1150, when the imperial family so called its own special state
in Honan because it was surrounded by all the others. The
name was retained as the empire grew, and thus has strengthened
the popular belief that it is really situated in the centre
of the earth; <i>Chung Kwoh jin</i>, or ‘men of the Middle Kingdom,’
denotes the Chinese. All these names indicate the vanity
and ignorance of the people respecting their geographical
position and their rank among the nations; they have not been
alone in this foible, for the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans all
had terms for their possessions which intimated their own
ideas of their superiority; while, too, the area of none of those
monarchies, in their widest extent, equalled that of China
Proper. The family of Tsin also established the custom, since
continued, of calling the country by the name of the dynasty
then reigning; but, while the brief duration of that house of
forty-four years was not long enough to give it much currency
among the people, succeeding dynasties, by their talents and
prowess, imparted their own as permanent appellations to the
people and country. The terms <i>Han-jin</i> and <i>Han-tsz’</i> (<i>i.e.</i>,
men of Han or sons of Han) are now in use by the people to
denote themselves: the last also means a “brave man.” <i>Tang-jin</i>,
or ‘Men of Tang,’ is quite as frequently heard in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
southern provinces, where the phrase <i>Tang Shan</i>, or ‘Hills of
Tang,’ denotes the whole country. The Buddhists of India
called the land <i>Chin-tan</i>, or the ‘Dawn,’ and this appellation
has been used in Chinese writings of that sect.</p>

<p>The present dynasty calls the empire <i>Ta Tsing Kwoh</i>, or
‘Great Pure Kingdom;’ but the people themselves have refused
the corresponding term of <i>Tsing-jin</i>, or ‘Men of Tsing.’
The empire is also sometimes termed <i>Tsing Chau</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘[land
of the] Pure Dynasty,’ by metonymy for the family that rules
it. The term now frequently heard in western countries&mdash;the
Celestial Empire&mdash;is derived from <i>Tien Chau</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Heavenly
Dynasty,’ meaning the kingdom which the dynasty appointed
by heaven rules over; but the term <i>Celestials</i>, for the people of
that kingdom, is entirely of foreign manufacture, and their
language could with difficulty be made to express such a patronymic.
The phrase <i>Lí Min</i>, or ‘Black-haired Race,’ is a
common appellation; the expressions <i>Hwa Yen</i>, the ‘Flowery
Language,’ and <i>Chung Hwa Kwoh</i>, the ‘Middle Flowery Kingdom,’
are also frequently used for the written language of the
country, because the Chinese consider themselves to be among
the most polished and civilized of all nations&mdash;which is the
sense of <i>hwa</i> in these phrases. The phrase <i>Nui Tí</i>, or ‘Inner
Land,’ is often employed to distinguish it from countries beyond
their borders, regarded as the desolate and barbarous
regions of the earth. <i>Hwa Hia</i> (the Glorious Hia) is an ancient
term for China, the Hia dynasty being the first of the series;
<i>Tung Tu</i>, or “Land of the East,” is a name used in Mohammedan
writings alone.</p>

<p>The present ruling dynasty has extended the limits of the
empire far beyond what they were under the Ming princes, and
nearly to their extent in the reign of Kublai, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1290. In
1840, its borders were well defined, reaching from Sagalien I.
on the north-east, in lat. 48° 10′ N. and long. 144° 50′ E., to
Hainan I. in the China Sea, on the south, in lat. 18° 10′ N., and
westward to the Belur-tag, in long. 74° E., inclosing a continuous
area, estimated, after the most careful valuation by
McCulloch, at 5,300,000 square miles. The longest line which
could be drawn in this vast region, from the south-western part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of Ílí, bordering on Kokand, north-easterly to the sea of Okhotsk,
is 3,350 miles; its greatest breadth is 2,100 miles, from the
Outer Hing-an or Stanovoi Mountains to the peninsula of Luichau
in Kwangtung:&mdash;the first measuring 71 degrees of longitude,
and the last over 34 of latitude.</p>

<p>Since that year the process of disintegration has been going
on, and the cession of Hongkong to the British has been followed
by greater partitions to Russia, which have altogether
reduced it more than half a million of square miles on the
north-east and west. Its limits on the western frontiers are
still somewhat undefined. The greatest breadth is from Albazin
on the Amur, nearly south to Hainan, 2,150 miles; and the
longest line which can be drawn in it runs from Sartokh in
Tibet, north-east to the junction of the Usuri River with the
Amur.</p>

<p>The form of the empire approaches a rectangle. It is
bounded on the east and south-east by various arms and portions
of the Pacific Ocean, beginning at the frontier of Corea,
and called on European maps the gulfs of Liautung and Pechele,
the Yellow Sea, channel of Formosa, China Sea, and Gulf
of Tonquin. Cochinchina and Burmah border on the provinces
of Kwangtung, Kwangsí, and Yunnan, in the south-west;
but most of the region near that frontier is inhabited by half-independent
tribes of Laos, Kakyens, Singphos, and others.
The southern ranges of the Himalaya separate Assam, Butan,
Sikkim, Nípal and states in India from Tibet, whose western
border is bounded by the nominally dependent country of
Ladak, or if that be excluded, by the Kara-korum Mountains.
The kingdoms or states of Cashmere, Badakshan, Kokand, and
the Kirghís steppe, lie upon the western frontiers of Little
Tibet, Ladak, and Ílí, as far north as the Russian border; the
high range of the Belur-tag or Tsung-ling separates the former
countries from the Chinese territory in this quarter. Russia is
conterminous with China from the Kirghís steppe along the
Altai chain and Kenteh range to the junction of the Argun
and the Amur, from whence the latter river and its tributary,
the Usuri, form the dividing line to the border of Corea, a
total stretch of 5,300 miles. The circuit of the whole empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
is 14,000 miles, or considerably over half the circumference of
the globe. These measurements, it must be remembered, are
of the roughest character. The coast line from the mouth of
the river Yaluh in Corea to that of the Annam in Cochinchina
is not far from 4,400 miles. This immense country comprises
about one-third of the continent, and nearly one-tenth of the
habitable part of the globe; and, next to Russia, is the largest
empire which has existed on the earth.</p>

<p>It will, perhaps, contribute to a better comprehension of the
area of the Chinese Empire to compare it with some other countries.
Russia is nearly 6,500 miles in its greatest length,
about 1,500 in its average breadth, and measures 8,369,144<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
square miles, or one-seventh of the land on the globe. The
United States of America extends about 3,000 miles from Monterey
on the Pacific in a north-easterly direction to Maine, and
about 1,700 from Lake of the Woods to Florida. The area of
this territory is now estimated at 2,936,166 square miles, with
a coast line of 5,120 miles. The area of the British Empire
is not far from 7,647,000 square miles, but the boundaries of
some of the colonies in Hindostan and South Africa are not
definitely laid down; the superficies of the two colonies of
Australia and New Zealand is nearly equal to that of all the
other possessions of the British crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENERAL DIVISIONS.</div>

<p>The Chinese themselves divide the empire into three principal
parts, rather by the different form of government in each,
than by any geographical arrangement.</p>

<p>I. The <i>Eighteen Provinces</i>, including, with trivial additions,
the country conquered by the Manchus in 1664.</p>

<p>II. <i>Manchuria</i>, or the native country of the Manchus, lying
north of the Gulf of Liautung as far as the Amur and west of
the Usuri River.</p>

<p>III. <i>Colonial Possessions</i>, including Mongolia, Ílí (comprising
Sungaria and Eastern Turkestan), Koko-nor, and Tibet.</p>

<p>The first of these divisions alone is that to which other
nations have given the name of China, and is the only part
which is entirely settled by the Chinese. It lies on the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
slope of the high table-land of Central Asia, in the south-eastern
angle of the continent; and for beauty of scenery, fertility
of soil, salubrity of climate, magnificent and navigable rivers,
and variety and abundance of its productions, will compare with
any portion of the globe. The native name for this portion, as
distinguished from the rest, is <i>Shih-pah Săng</i> or the ‘Eighteen
Provinces,’ but the people themselves usually mean this part
alone by the term <i>Chung Kwoh</i>. The area of the Eighteen
Provinces is estimated by McCulloch at 1,348,870 square miles,
but if the full area of the provinces of Kansuh and Chihlí be
included, this figure is not large enough; the usual computation
is 1,297,999 square miles; Malte Brun reckons it at
1,482,091 square miles; but the entire dimensions of the Eighteen
Provinces, as the Chinese define them, cannot be much
under 2,000,000 square miles, the excess lying in the extension
of the two provinces mentioned above. This part, consequently,
is rather more than two-fifths of the area of the whole empire.</p>

<p>The old limits are, however, more natural, and being better
known may still be retained. They give nearly a square form
to the provinces, the length from north to south being 1,474
miles, and the breadth 1,355 miles; but the diagonal line from
the north-east corner to Yunnan is 1,669 miles, and that from
Amoy to the north-western part of Kansuh is 1,557 miles.
China Proper, therefore, measures about seven times the size of
France, and fifteen times that of the United Kingdom; it is
nearly half as large as all Europe, which is 3,650,000 square
miles. Its area is, however, nearer that of all the States of the
American Union lying east of the Mississippi River, with Texas,
Arkansas, Missouri and Iowa added; these all cover 1,355,309
square miles. The position of the two countries facing the
western borders of great oceans is another point of likeness,
which involves considerable similarity in climate; there is
moreover a further resemblance between the size of the provinces
in China and those of the newer States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNTAIN CHAINS.</div>

<p>Before proceeding to define the three great basins into which
China may be divided, it will give a better idea of the whole
subject to speak of the mountain ranges which lie within and
near or along the limits of the country. The latter in them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>selves
form almost an entire wall inclosing and defining the old
empire; the principal exceptions being the western boundaries
of Yunnan, the border between Ílí and the Kirghís steppe, and
the trans-Amur region.</p>

<p>Commencing at the north-eastern corner of the basin of the
Amur above its mouth, near lat. 56° N., are the first summits
of the Altai range, which during its long course of 2,000 miles
takes several names; this range forms the northern limit of the
table-land of Central Asia. At its eastern part, the range is
called Stanovoi by the Russians, and <i>Wai Hing-an</i> by the Chinese;
the first name is applied as far west as the confluence of
the Songari with the Amur, beyond which, north-west as far
as lake Baikal, the Russians call it the Daourian Mountains.
The distance from the lake to the ocean is about 600 miles, and
all within Russian limits. Beyond lake Baikal, westward, the
chain is called the Altai, <i>i.e.</i>, Golden Mountains, and sometimes
<i>Kin shan</i>, having a similar meaning. Near the head-waters of
the river Selenga this range separates into two nearly parallel
systems running east and west. The southern one, which lies
mostly in Mongolia, is called the Tangnu, and rises to a much
higher elevation than the northern spur. The Tangnu Mountains
continue under that name on the Chinese maps in a south-westerly
direction, but this chain properly joins the Tien shan,
or Celestial Mountains, in the province of Cobdo, and continues
until it again unites with the Altai further west, near the
junction of the Kirghís steppe with China and Russia. The
length of the whole chain is not far from 2,500 miles, and
except near the Tshulyshman River, does not, so far as is
known, rise to the snow line, save in detached peaks. The
average elevation is supposed to be in the neighborhood of
7,000 feet; most of it lies between latitudes 47° and 52° N.,
largely covered with forests and susceptible of cultivation.</p>

<p>The next chain is the Belur-tag, Tartash ling, in Chinese
<i>Tsung ling</i>, Onion Mountains, or better, Blue Mountains, so called
from their distant hue.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This range lies in the south-west of Son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>garia,
separating that territory from Badakshan; it commences
about lat. 50° N., nearly at right angles with the Tien shan, and
extends south, rising to a great height, though little is known of
it. It may be considered as the connecting link between the
Tien shan and the Kwănlun; or rather, both this and the latter
may be considered as proceeding from a mountain knot, detached
from the Hindu-kush, in the south-western part of Turkestan
called Pushtikhur, the Belur-tag coming from its northern
side, while the Kwănlun issues from its eastern side, and extends
across the middle of the table-land to Koko-nor, there diverging
into two branches. This mountain knot lies between latitudes
36° and 37° N., and longitudes 70° and 74° E. The Himalaya
range proceeds from it south-easterly, along the southern frontier
of Tibet, till it breaks up near the head-waters of the
Yangtsz’, Salween, and other rivers between Tibet, Burmah,
and Yunnan, thus nearly completing the inland frontier of the
empire. A small spur from the Yun ling, in the west of Yunnan,
in the country of the Singphos and borders of Assam,
may also be regarded as forming part of the boundary line.
The <i>Chang-peh shan</i> lies between the head-waters of the Yaluh
and Toumen rivers, along the Corean frontier, forming a
spur of the lower range of the Sihota or <i>Sih-hih-teh</i> Mountains,
east of the Usuri.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TIEN SHAN AND KWĂNLUN RANGES.</div>

<p>Within the confines of the empire are four large chains,
some of the peaks in their course rising to stupendous elevations,
but the ridges generally falling below the snow line.
The first is the Tien shan or Celestial Mountains, called Tengkiri
by the Mongols, and sometimes erroneously Alak Mountains.
This chain begins at the northern extremity of the
Belur-tag in lat. 40° N., or more properly comes in from the
west, and extends from west to east between longitudes 76° and
90° E., and generally along the 22° of north latitude, dividing
Ílí into the Northern and Southern Circuits. Its western portion
is called Muz-tag; the Muz-daban, about long. 79° E., between
Kuldja and Aksu, is where the road from north to south
runs across, leading over a high glacier above the snow line.
East of this occurs a mass of peaks among the highest in Central
Asia, called Bogdo-ula; and at the eastern end, near Ur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>umtsi,
as it declines to the desert, are traces of volcanic action
seen in solfataras and spaces covered with ashes, but no active
volcanoes are now known. The doubtful volcano of Pí shan,
between the glacier and the Bogdo-ula, is the only one reported
in continental China. The Tien shan end abruptly at their
eastern point, where the ridge meets the desert, not far from
the meridian of Barkul in Kansuh, though Humboldt considers
the hills in Mongolia a continuation of the range eastward,
as far as the Nui Hing-an. The space between the
Altai and Tien shan is very much broken up by mountainous
spurs, which may be considered as connecting links of them
both, though no regular chain exists. The western prolongation
of the Tien shan, under the name of the Muz-tag, extends
from the high pass only as far as the junction of the Belur-tag,
beyond which, and out of the Chinese Empire, it continues
nearly west, south of the river Sihon toward Kodjend, under
the names of Ak-tag and Asferah-tag; this part is covered with
perpetual snow.</p>

<p>Nearly parallel with the Tien shan in part of its course is
the Nan shan, Kwănlun or Koulkun range of mountains, also
called <i>Tien Chu</i> or ‘Celestial Pillar’ by Chinese geographers.
The Kwănlun starts from the Pushtikhur knot in lat. 36° N.,
and runs along easterly in nearly that parallel through the
whole breadth of the table-land, dividing Tibet from the desert
of Gobi in part of its course. About the middle of its extent,
not far from long. 90° E., it divides into several ranges,
which decline to the south-east through Koko-nor and Sz’chuen,
under the names of the Bayan-kara, the Burkhan-buddha,
the Shuga and the Tangla Mountains,&mdash;each more or less
parallel in their general south-east course till they merge
with the Yun ling (<i>i.e.</i>, Cloudy Mountains), about lat. 33° N.
Another group bends northerly, beyond the sources of the Yellow
River, and under the names of Altyn-tag, Nan shan, Ín
shan, and Ala shan, passes through Kansuh and Shensí to join
the Nui Hing-an, not far from the great bend of the Yellow
River. Some portion of the country between the extremities
of these two ranges is less elevated, but no plains occur, though
the parts north of Kansuh, where the Great Wall runs, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
rugged and unfertile. The large tract between the basins of
the Tarim River and that of the Yaru-tsangbu, including the
Kwănlun range, is mostly occupied by the desert of Gobi, and
is now one of the least known parts of the globe. The mineral
treasures of the Kwănlun are probably great, judging
from the many precious stones ascribed to it; this desolate region
is the favorite arena for the monsters, fairies, genii, and
other beings of Chinese legendary lore, and is the Olympus
where the Buddhist and Taoist divinities hold their mystic
sway, strange voices are heard, and marvels accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>From near the head-waters of the Yellow River, the four ridges
run south-easterly, and converge hard by the confines of Burmah
and Yunnan, within an area about one hundred miles in breadth.
The Yun ling range constitutes the western frontier of Sz’chuen,
and going south-east into Yunnan, thence turns eastward, under
the names of Nan ling, Mei ling, Wu-í shan, and other local
terms, passing through Kweichau, Hunan, and dividing Kwangtung
and Fuhkien from Kiangsí and Chehkiang, bends north-east
till it reaches the sea opposite Chusan. One or two spurs
branch off north from this range through Hunan and Kiangsí,
as far as the Yangtsz’, but they are all of moderate elevation,
covered with forests, and susceptible of cultivation. The descent
from the Siueh ling or Bayan-kara Mountains, and the
western part of the Yun ling, to the Pacific, is very gradual.
The Chinese give a list of fifty peaks lying in the provinces
which are covered with snow for the whole or part of the
year, and describe glaciers on several of them.</p>

<p>Another less extensive ridge branches off nearly due east
from the Bayan-kara Mountains in Koko-nor, and forms a moderately
high range of mountains between the Yellow River and
Yangtsz’ kiang as far as long. 112° E., on the western borders
of Nganhwui; this range is called Ko-tsing shan, and Peh
ling (<i>i.e.</i>, Northern Mountains), on European maps. These two
chains, viz., the Yun ling&mdash;with its continuation of the Mei
ling&mdash;and the Peh ling, with their numerous offsets, render the
whole of the western part of China very uneven.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">HING-AN AND HIMALAYA RANGES.</div>

<p>On the east of Mongolia, and commencing near the bend of
the Yellow River, or rather forming a continuation of the
range in Shansí, is the Nui Hing-an ling or Sialkoi, called also
Soyorti range, which runs north-east on the west side of the
basin of the Amur, till it reaches the Wai Hing-an, in lat.
56° N. The sides of the ridge toward the desert are nearly
naked, but the eastern acclivities are well wooded and fertile.
On the confines of Corea a spur strikes off westward through
Shingking, called Kolmin-shanguin alin by the Manchus, and
Chang-peh shan (<i>i.e.</i>, Long White Mountains) by the Chinese.
Between the Sialkoi and Sihota are two smaller ridges defining
the basin of the Nonni River on the east and west. Little is
known of the elevation of these chains except that they are
low in comparison with the great western ranges, and under the
snow line.</p>

<p>The fourth system of mountains is the Himalaya, which
bounds Tibet on the south, while the Kwănlun and Burkhan
Buddha range defines it on the north. A small range runs
through it from west to east, connected with the Himalaya by
a high table-land, which surrounds the lakes Manasa-rowa and
Ravan-hrad, and near or in which are the sources of the Indus,
Ganges, and Yaru-tsangbu. This range is called Gang-dis-ri
and Zang, and also Kailasa in Dr. Buchanan’s map, and its
eastern end is separated from the Yun ling by the narrow valley
of the Yangtsz’, which here flows from north to south. The
country north of the Gang-dis-ri is divided into two portions by a
spur which extends in a north-west direction as far as the Kwănlun,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
called the Kara-korum Mountains. On the western side
of this range lies Ladak, drained by one of the largest branches
of the Indus, and although included in the imperial domains
on Chinese maps, has long been separated from imperial cognizance.
The Kara-korum Mountains may therefore be taken
as composing part of the boundary of the empire; Chinese
geographers regard them as forming a continuation of the
Tsung ling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">PUMPELLY’S SINIAN SYSTEM.</div>

<p>This hasty sketch of the mountain chains in and around
China needs to be further illustrated by Pumpelly’s outlines of
their general course and elevation in what he suitably terms the
<i>Sinian System</i>, applied “to that extensive northeast-southwest
system of upheaval which is traceable through nearly all Eastern
Asia, and to which this portion of the continent owes its most
salient features.” He has developed this system in the <cite>Researches
in China, Mongolia and Japan</cite>, issued by the Smithsonian
Institution in 1866. The mountains of China correspond
in many respects to the Appalachian system in America, and
its revolution probably terminated soon after the deposition of
the Chinese coal measures. Mr. Pumpelly describes the principal
anticlinal axes of elevation in China Proper, beginning
with the Barrier Range, extending through the northern part of
Chihlí and Shansí, where it trends W.S.W., prolonging across
the Yellow River at Pao-teh, and hence S.W. through Shansí
and Kansuh, coinciding with the watershed between the bend
of that river, which traverses it through an immense gorge.</p>

<p>The next axis east begins at the Tushih Gate, and goes S.W.
to the Nankau Pass, both of them in the Great Wall, and
thence across Shansí to the elbow of the Yellow River, and
onward to Western Sz’chuen, forming the watershed within the
bend of the Yangtsz’. In the regions between these two axes
are found coal deposits. A central axis succeeds this in Shansí,
crossing the Yangtsz’ near Íchang, and passing on S.W. through
Kweichau to the Nan ling; going N.E., it runs through
Honan and subsides as it gets over the Yellow River, till in
Shantung and the Regent’s Sword it rises higher and higher as
it stretches on to the Chang-peh shan in Manchuria, and the
ridge between the Songari and Usuri rivers. Between the last
two ranges lie the great coal, iron, and salt deposits in the
provinces, and each side of the central axis huge troughs and
basins occur, such as the valley of the Yangtsz’ in Yunnan, the
Great Plain in Nganhwui and Chihlí, the Gulf of Pechele, and
the basins of the Liao and Songari rivers.</p>

<p>The coast axis of elevation is indicated by ranges of granitic
mountains between Kiangsí and Kiangsu on the north, and
Chehkiang and Fuhkien on the south, extending S.W. through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Kwangtung into the Yun ling, and N.E. into the Chusan
Archipelago, thence across to Corea and the Sihota Mountains
east of the Usuri River. An outlying granitic range,
reaching from Hongkong north-easterly to Wănchau, and S.W.
to Hainan Island, marks a fifth axis of elevation.</p>

<p>Crossing these anticlinal axes are three ranges, coming into
China Proper from the west in such a manner as to prove
highly beneficial to its structure. The northern is apparently a
continuation of the Bayan-kara Mountains in a S.E. direction
into Kansuh, and south of the river Wei into Honan, under the
name of the Hiung shan or ‘Bear Mountains.’ The centre is
an offset from this, going across the north of Hupeh. The
southern appears to be a prolongation of the Himalaya into
Yunnan and Kwangsí, making the watershed between the
Yangtsz’ and Pearl river basins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DESERT OF GOBI.</div>

<p>Between the Tien shan and the Kwănlun range on the south-west,
and reaching to the Sialkoi on the north-east, in an oblique
direction, lies the great desert of Gobi or Sha-moh, both words
signifying a <i>waterless plain</i>, or <i>sandy floats</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The entire length
of this waste is more than 1,800 miles, but if its limits are
extended to the Belur-tag and the Sialkoi, at its western and
eastern extremity, it will reach 2,200 miles; the average breadth
is between 350 and 400 miles, subject, however, to great variations.
The area within the mountain ranges which define it is
over a million square miles, and few of the streams occurring
in it find their way to the ocean. The whole of this tract is not
a barren desert, though no part of it can lay claim to more than
comparative fertility; and the great altitude of most portions
seems to be as much the cause of its sterility as the nature of
the soil. Some portions have relapsed into a waste because of
the destruction of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The western portion of Gobi, lying east of the Tsung ling
and north of the Kwănlun, between long. 76° and 94° E., and
in lat. 36° and 41° N., is about 1,000 miles in length, and
between 300 and 400 wide. Along the southern side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Tien shan extends a strip of arable land from 50 to 80 miles in
width, producing grain, pasturage, cotton, and other things,
and in which lie nearly all the Mohammedan cities and forts
of the <i>Nan Lu</i>. The Tarim and its branches flow eastward
into Lob-nor, through the best part of this tract, from 76° to
89° E.; and along the banks of the Khoten River a road runs
from Yarkand to that city, and thence to H’lassa. Here the
desert is comparatively narrow. This part is called <i>Han hai</i>,
or ‘Mirage Sea,’ by the Chinese, and is sometimes known as the
desert of Lob-nor. The remainder of this region is an almost
unmitigated waste, and north of Koko-nor assumes its most
terrific appearance, being covered with dazzling stones, and
rendered insufferably hot by the reflection of the sun’s rays
from these and numerous movable mountains of sand. Nor in
winter is the climate milder or more endurable. “The icy
winds of Siberia, the almost constantly unclouded sky, the bare
saline soil, and its great altitude above the sea, combine to make
the Gobi, or desert of Mongolia, one of the coldest countries in
the whole of Asia.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The sandhills&mdash;<i>kuzupchi</i>, as the Mongols call them&mdash;appear
north of the Ala shan and along the Yellow River, and when
the wind sets them in motion they gradually travel before it,
and form a great danger to travellers who try to cross them.
One Chinese author says, “There is neither water, herb, man,
nor smoke;&mdash;if there is no smoke, there is absolutely nothing.”
The limits of the actual desert are not easily defined, for near
the base of the mountain ranges, streams and vegetation are
usually found.</p>

<p>Near the meridian of Hami, long. 94° E., the desert is narrowed
to about 150 miles. The road from Kiayü kwan to
Hami runs across this narrow part, and travellers find water at
various places in their route. It divides Gobi into two parts&mdash;the
desert of Lob-nor and the Great Gobi&mdash;the former being
about 4,500 feet elevation, and the latter or eastern not higher
than 4,000 feet. The borders of Kansuh now extend across
this tract to the foot of the Tien shan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>The eastern part, or Great Gobi, stretches from the eastern
declivity of the Tien shan, in long. 94° to 120° E., and about
lat. 40° N., as far as the Inner Hing-an. Its width between
the Altai and the Ín shan range varies from 500 to 700 miles.
Through the middle of this tract extends the depressed valley
properly called Sha-moh, from 150 to 200 miles across, and
whose lowest depression is from 2,600 to 2,000 feet above the
sea. Sand almost covers the surface of this valley, generally
level, but sometimes rising into low hills. The road from Urga
to Kalgan, crossing this tract, is watered during certain seasons
of the year, and clothed with grass. It is 660 miles, and
forty-seven posts are placed along the route. The crow, lark,
and sand-grouse are abundant on this road, the first being a real
pest, from its pilfering habits. Such vegetation as occurs is
scanty and stunted, affording indifferent pasture, and the water
in the small streams and lakes is brackish and unpotable. North
and south of the Sha-moh the surface is gravelly and sometimes
rocky, the vegetation more vigorous, and in many places affords
good pasturages for the herds of the Kalkas tribes. In those
portions bordering on or included in Chihlí province, among
the Tsakhars, agricultural labors are repaid, and millet, oats,
and barley are produced, though not to a great extent. Trees
are met with on the water-courses, but not to form forests.
This region is called <i>tsau-ti</i>, or Grassland, and maintains large
herds of sheep and cattle. It extends more or less northward
towards Siberia. The Etsina is the largest inland stream in
this division of Gobi, but on its north-eastern borders are some
large tributaries of the Amur. On the south of the Sialkoi
range the desert-lands reach nearly to the Chang-peh shan,
about five degrees beyond those mountains. The general features
of this portion of the earth’s surface are less forbidding
than Sahara, but more so than the steppes of Siberia or the
pampas of Buenos Ayres. The whole of Gobi is regarded by
Pumpelly as having formed a portion of a great ocean, which,
in comparatively recent geological times, extended south to the
Caspian and Black Seas, and between the Ural and Inner Hing an
Mountains, and was drained off by an upheaval whose traces
and effects can be detected in many parts. “It appears to me,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
he adds, “that the ancient physical geography of this region,
and the effects of its elevation, present one of the most important
fields of exploration.” It will no doubt soon be more fully
explored. Baron Richthofen describes Central Asia as properly
a shallow trough, 1,800 miles long and about 400 miles wide,
whose bottom is about 1,800 feet above the ocean; its ancient
shore-line extended between the Kwănlun and Tien shan ranges
on the west, from 5,000 to 10,000 feet high, and gradually falling
to 3,600 feet in its eastern shore. This is the <i>Han-hai</i>;
eastward is <i>Sha-moh</i>, and outside of both these wildernesses
are the peripheral regions, where the waters flow to the ocean,
carrying their silt, the erosions from the mountains. Inside of
the shore-line nothing reaches the oceans, and these results of
degradation are washed or blown into the valleys, and the
country is buried in its own dust.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The <i>rivers</i> of China are her glory, and no country can
compare with her for natural facilities of inland navigation.
The people themselves consider that portion of geography relating
to their rivers as the most interesting, and give it the
greatest attention. The four largest rivers in the empire are the
Yellow River, the Yangtsz’, the Amur, and the Tarim; the
Yaru-tsangbu also runs more than a thousand miles within its
borders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE YELLOW RIVER.</div>

<p>The <i>Hwang ho</i>, or ‘Yellow River,’ rises in the plain of Odontala,
called in Chinese <i>Sing-suh hai</i>, or ‘Starry Sea,’ from the
numerous springs or lakelets found there between the Shuga
and Bayan-kara Mountains, in lat. 35⅓°, and about long. 96° E.,
and not a hundred miles from the Yangtsz’. The Chinese popularly
believe that the Yellow River runs underground from
Lob-nor to Sing-suh hai. In this region are two lakes&mdash;the
Dzaring and Oling, which are its fountains; and its course is
very crooked after it leaves them. It turns first south 30 miles,
then east 160, then nearly west about 120, winding through
gorges of the Kwănlun; the river then flows north-east and
east to Lanchau in Kansuh, having gone about 700 miles in its
devious line. From Lanchau it turns northward along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Great Wall for 430 miles, till deflected eastward by the Ín shan,
on the edge of the plateau, and incloses the country of the
Ortous Mongols within this great bend. A spur of the Peh
ling forces it south, about long. 110° E., between Shansí and
Shensí, for some 500 miles, till it enters the Great Plain,
having run 1,130 miles from Lanchau. Through this loess region
it becomes tinged with the soil which imparts both color
and name to it. At the northern bend it separates in several
small lakes and branches, and during this part of its course,
for more than 500 miles, receives not a single stream of any
size, while it is still so rapid, in descending from the plateau,
as to demand much care when crossing it by boats. At the
south-western corner of Shansí this river meets its largest
tributary, the Wei, which comes in from the westward after
a course of 400 miles, and is more available as a navigable
stream than any other of the affluents. The area of the whole
basin is less than that of the Yangtsz’, and may be estimated
at about 475,000 square miles; though the source of this
stream is only 1,290 miles in a direct line from its mouth,
its numerous windings prolong its course to nearly double that
distance.</p>

<p>The great differences of level in winter and summer have
always made this river nearly useless, except as a drain; while
the effect of the long-continued deposit of silt along its lower
level course has finally choked the mouth altogether. This
remarkable result has been hastened, no doubt, by the dikes
built along the banks to the east of Kaifung, which thus forced
the floods to fill up the channel, and pushed the waters back
over 500 miles to Honan-fu. Here the land is low, and the
refluent waters gradually worked their way through marshes
and creeks into the river Wei on the north bank, and thus
found a north-east channel into the Canal and the Ta-tsing
River, till they reached the Gulf of Pechele. A small part of
these floods have perhaps gone south into the head-waters of
the river Hwai, and thence into Hung-tsih Lake; but that lake
has shrivelled, like its great feeder, and all its waters flow into
the Yangtsz’. The history of the Yellow River furnishes a conclusive
argument against diking a river’s banks to restrain its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
floods. It has now reverted to the channel it occupied about
fourteen centuries ago.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE YANGTSZ’ KIANG.</div>

<p>Far more tranquil and useful is its rival, the Yangtsz’ kiang,
called also simply <i>Kiang</i> or <i>Ta kiang</i>, the ‘River,’ or ‘Great
River.’ It is often erroneously named on western maps, Kyang
Ku, which merely means ‘mouth of the river.’ The sources
of the Kiang are in the Tangla Mountains and the Kwănlun
range, and are placed on native maps in three streams flowing
from the southern side of the Bayan-kara. This has been
partly confirmed by Col. Prejevalsky. In January, 1873, he
reached the Murui-ussu (Tortuous River) in lat. 35°, long. 94°,
at its junction with the Napchitai, the northern of the three
branches, and found it 750 feet wide at that season. In spring,
the river’s bed there is filled up a mile wide. Its course thence
is south-east, receiving three other streams, all of which may be
considered as its head-waters. All their channels are over ten
thousand feet above the sea, but the ranges near them are under
the snow-line. There is no authentic account of its course from
this union till it joins the Yalung kiang in Sz’chuen, a distance
of nearly 1,300 miles; but Chinese maps indicate a south-easterly
direction through the gorges of the Yun ling, till it
bursts out from the mountains in lat. 26° N., where it turns
north-east. During much of this distance it bears the name of
the Po-lai-tsz’. The Yalung River rises very near the Yellow
River, and runs parallel with the Kiang in a valley further east,
flowing upwards of 600 miles before they join. Great rafts
of timber are floated down both these streams, for sale at
the towns further east, but no large boats are seen on them
before they leave the mountains. The town of Batang, in
Sz’chuen, on the road from H’lassa, is the first large place on
the river. The main trunk is called Kin sha kiang (<i>i.e.</i>, Golden-sand
River), until it receives the Yalung in the southern part
of Sz’chuen, which the Chinese there regard as the principal
stream of the two. Beyond the junction, the united river is
called Ta kiang as far as Wuchang, in Hupeh, beyond which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the people know it also as the Chang kiang, or ‘Long River.’
They do not often call it Yangtsz’, which is properly applied
only to the reach from Nanking out to sea, which lay within
the old region of Yangchau. This name has been erroneously
written in Chinese, and thence translated ‘Son of the Ocean.’
The French often call it the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fleuve Bleu</i>, but the Chinese have
no such name. Its general course from Wuchang is easterly,
receiving various tributaries on both shores, until it discharges
its waters at Tsungming Island, by two mouths, in lat. 32° N.,
more than 1,850 miles from its mouth in a direct line, but flowing
nearly 3,000 miles in all its windings.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>One of the largest and most useful of its tributaries in its
lower course is the Kan kiang in Kiangsí, which empties
through the Poyang lake, and continues the transverse communication
from north to south, connecting with the Grand
Canal. The Tungting lake receives the Siang and Yuen, which
drain the northern sides of the Nan ling in Hunan; and west
of them is the Kungtan or Wu, which comes in with its
surplus waters from Kweichau. These are on the south; the
Han in Hupeh, and the Kialing, Min, and Loh in Sz’chuen, are
the main affluents on the north, contributing the drainage
south of the Peh ling. The Grand Canal comes in opposite
Chinkiang, and from thence the deep channel, able to carry the
largest men-of-war on its bosom, finds its way to the Pacific.
No two rivers can be more unlike in their general features than
these two mighty streams. While the Yellow River is unsteady,
the Yangtsz’ is uniform and deep in its lower course,
and available for rafts from Batang in the western confines of
Sz’chuen, and for boats from beyond Tungchuen in Yunnan,
more than 1,700 miles from its mouth. Its great body and
depth afford ample room for ocean steam-ships 200 miles, as far
as Nanking, where in some places no bottom could be found at
twenty fathoms, while the banks are not so low as to be often
injured by the freshets, even when the flood is over thirty feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
At Pingshan above Süchau in Sz’chuen, 1,550 miles from its
mouth, Blakiston reckons the river to be 1,500 feet above tide-water,
which gives an average fall of 12 inches to a geographical
mile; the inclination is increased to 19 inches in some
portions, and it is this force which carries the silt of this stream
out to sea, but which is wanting in the Yellow River. The fall
of the Yangtsz’ is nearly double that of the Nile and Amazon,
and half that of the Mississippi. The amount of water discharged
is estimated at 500,000 cubic feet a second at Íchang,
about 700 miles up, and it may reasonably be concluded that
at Tsungming it discharges in times of flood a million cubic
feet per second. Barrow calculated the discharge of the Yellow
River in 1798 to be 11,616 cubic feet per second, when the
current ran seven miles an hour. No river in the world exceeds
the Yangtsz’ for arrangement of subsidiary streams, which render
the whole basin accessible as far as the Yalung. When a
ship-canal has been dug around the gorges and rapids between
Íchang and Kwei, steam-vessels can ascend nearly two thousand
miles. The area of its basin is estimated at 548,000 square
miles; and from its central course, and the number of provinces
through which it passes, it has been termed the Girdle of
China; while for its size, perennial and ample supply of water,
and accessibility for navigation, it ranks with the great rivers
of the world.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Besides these two notable rivers, numerous others empty
into the ocean along the coast from Hainan to the Amur, three
of which drain large tracts of country, and afford access to
many populous cities and districts. The third basin is that
south of the Nan ling to the ocean; it is drained chiefly by the
Chu kiang, and its form is much less regular than those of the
Yellow River and Yangtsz’. The Chu kiang or Pearl River,
like most of the rivers in China, has many names during its
course, and is formed by three principal branches, respectively
called East, North, and West rivers, according to the quarter
from whence they come. The last is by far the largest, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of them are navigable most of their length. They disembogue
together at Canton, and drain a region of not much less than
130,000 square miles, being all the country east of the Yun ling
and south of the Nan ling ranges. The rivers in Yunnan, for
the most part, empty into the Salween, Saigon, Meikon, and
other streams in Cochinchina. The Min, which flows by Fuhchau,
the Tsih, upon which Ningpo lies, the Tsientang, leading
up to Hangchau, and the Pei ho, or White River, emptying into
the Gulf of Pechele, are the most considerable among these
lesser outlets in the provinces; while the Liau ho and Yahluh
kiang, discharging into the Gulf of Liautung, are the only two
that deserve mention in Southern Manchuria. The difference
between the number of river-mouths cutting the Chinese coast
and that of the United States is very striking, resulting from
the different direction of the mountain chains in the interior.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAKES OF CHINA.</div>

<p>The <i>lakes</i> of China are comparatively few and small; all
those in the provinces of any size lie within the Plain, and are
connected with the two great rivers. The largest is the Tungting
in Hunan, about 220 miles in circumference, through
which the waters of the Siang and Yuen rivers flow, and fill
its channels and beds according to the season; it is now the silted-up
bed of a former inland sea in Hupeh, lying on both sides
of the Yangtsz’, and through which countless lakes, creeks, and
canals form a navigable network between that river and the
Han. The lake receives the silt as the tributaries flow on
through it, and discharge themselves along the deep outlet
near Yohchau; this depression altogether is about 200 miles
long and 80 broad. About 320 miles eastward lies the Poyang
Lake in Kiangsí, which also discharges the surplus waters of
the Kan into the Yangtsz’. It is nearly 90 miles long, and
about 20 in breadth, inclosing within its bosom many beautiful
and populous islets. The scenery around this lake is highly
picturesque, and its trade and fisheries are more important
than those of the Tungting. The Yangtsz’ receives the waters
of several other lakes as it approaches the ocean, the largest
of which are the Ta hu or ‘Great Lake’ near Suchau, and the
Tsau hu, lying on the northern bank, between Nganking and
Nanking; both these lakes join the river by navigable streams,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and the former is connected with the ocean by more than
one channel.</p>

<p>The only considerable lake connected with the Yellow River
is the Hungtsih in Kiangsu, situated near the junction of that
river and the Grand Canal, into which it discharges the drainings
of the Hwai River; it is more remarkable for the fleets of
boats upon it than for scenery in the vicinity. The larger part
of the country between the mouths of the two rivers is so
marshy and full of lakes, as to suggest the idea that the
whole was once an enormous estuary where their waters joined,
or else that their deposits have filled up a huge lake which
once occupied this tract, leaving only a number of lesser sheets.
Besides these, there are small lakes in Chihlí and Shantung;
also the <i>Tien</i>, the <i>Sien</i>, and the <i>Tali</i>, of moderate extent, in
Yunnan; all of them support an aquatic population upon the
fish taken from their waters.</p>

<p>The largest lake in Manchuria is the Hinkai-nor in Kirin,
near the source of the Usuri; the two lakes Hurun and Puyur,
or Pir, in the basin of the Nonni River, give their name to
Hurun-pir, the western district of Tsitsihar; but of the extent
and productions of these sheets of water little is known.</p>

<p>The regions lying north and south of Gobi contain many
salt lakes, none of them individually comparing with the Aral
Sea, but collectively covering a much larger extent, and most
of them receiving the waters of the streams which drain their
own isolated basins. The peculiarities of these little known
parts, especially the depression on each side of the Tien shan,
are such as to render them among the most interesting fields
for geographical and geological research in the world. The
largest one in Turkestan is Lob-nor, stated to be a great marsh
overgrown with tall reeds and having a length of 75 miles and
width of 15 miles.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Bostang-nor, said to connect with this
lake, is placed on Chinese maps some 30 miles north of it.
North of the Tien shan the lakes are larger and more numerous;
the Dzaisang, Kisil-bash and Issik-kul are the most important.
All these lakes are salt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>The whole region of Koko-nor is a country of lakes. The
Oling and Dzaring are among the sources of the Yellow River;
and the <i>Tsing hai</i>, or Azure Sea, better known as Koko-nor,
gives its name to the province. The Tengkiri-nor in Tibet lies
to the north of H’lassa, and is the largest sheet of water within
the frontiers of the empire. In its neighborhood are numerous
small lakes extending northward into Koko-nor. The
Palti or Yamorouk is shaped like a ring, an island in its centre
occupying nearly the whole surface. Ulterior Tibet possesses
many lakes on both sides of the Gang-dis-ri range; the Yik
and Paha, near Gobi, are the largest, being only two of a long
row of them south of the Kwănlun range.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOUNDARIES OF THE PROVINCES.</div>

<p>The Eighteen Provinces are bounded on the north-east by the
colony of Shingking, from which they are separated by the
line of a former palisade marking the boundary from the town
of Shan-hai kwan to the Hwang ho. Following this stream to
its sources in the Ín shan, the boundary then crosses these
mountains and pursues a west and south-west course, through
the territories of roving Mongol tribes, until it finds the Yellow
River at the settlement of Hokiuh in Shensí. West of this
the Great Wall divides the provinces of Shensí and Kansuh
from the Mongolian deserts as far as the Kiayü Pass, beyond
which lies the desert of Gobi, called <i>Peh hai</i> (North Sea) and <i>Hah
hai</i> (Black Sea). On the east are the Gulf of Pechele and the
Yellow Sea or <i>Hwang hai</i>, also called <i>Tung hai</i> (Eastern Sea)
as far south as the Channel of Formosa. This channel and
the China Sea lie on the south-east and south, as far as the Gulf
of Tongking and the confines of Annam. Kwangsí and Yunnan
border on Annam and Siam on their south sides, while
Burmah marks the western frontier, but nearly the whole south-west
and western frontiers beyond Yunnan and Sz’chuen are
possessed by small tribes of uncivilized people, over whom
neither the Chinese nor Burmese have much real control.
Koko-nor bounds Sz’chuen and Kansuh on their western and
south-western sides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF THE COAST.</div>

<p>The coast of China, from Hainan to the mouth of the
Yangtsz’, is bordered with multitudes of islands and rocky
islets; from that point northward to Liautung, the shores are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
low, and, except in Shantung, the coast is rendered dangerous
by shoals.</p>

<p>South of the Pei ho, along to the end of Shantung Promontory,
the coast is bolder, increasing in height after passing
the Miautau Islands, though neither side of the promontory
presents any point of remarkable elevation; Cape Macartney,
at the eastern end, is a conspicuous bluff when approaching it
from sea. From this cape to the mouth of the Tsientang
River, near Chapu, a distance of about 400 miles, the coast is
low, especially between the mouths of the Yangtsz’ and Yellow
rivers, and has but few good harbors. Quicksands in the
regions near these rivers and the Bay of Hangchau render the
navigation dangerous to native junks. From Kitto Point, near
Ningpo, down to Hongkong, the shores assume a bolder aspect,
and numerous small bays and coves occur among the islands,
affording safe refuge for vessels. The aspect along this part is
uninviting in the extreme, consisting principally of a succession
of yellowish cliffs and naked headlands, giving little promise
of the highly cultivated country beyond them. This bleak appearance
is caused by the rains washing the decomposed soil
off the surface; the rock being granite in a state of partial
and progressive disintegration, the loose soil is easily carried
down into the intervals. Another reason for its treeless surface
is owing to the practice of annually cutting the coarse
grass for fuel, and after the crop is gathered setting the stubble
on fire, in order to manure the ground for the coming year;
the fire and thinness of the soil together effectually prevent any
large growth of trees or shrubbery upon the hills.</p>

<p>The estuary of the Pearl River from the Bocca Tigris down
to the Grand Ladrones, a distance of 70 miles, and from Hongkong
westerly to the Island of Tungku, about 100 miles, is interspersed
with islands. The strait which separates Hainan
from the Peninsula of Luichau has been supposed to be the
place called by Arabian travellers in the ninth century the
Gates of China, but that channel was probably near the Chusan
Archipelago. That group of fertile islands is regarded as the
broken termination of the continental range of mountains running
through Chehkiang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The Island of Formosa, or Taiwan, connects the islands of
Japan and Lewchew with Luçonia. Between Formosa and the
coast lie the Pescadores or Panghu Islands, a group much less
in extent and number than the Chusan Islands. The Chinese
have itineraries of all the places, headlands, islands, etc., along
the entire coast, but they do not afford much information respecting
the names of positions.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The first objects that invite attention in the general aspect of
China Proper are the Great Plain in the north-east, and the
three longitudinal basins into which the country is divided by
mountain chains running east and west.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The three great rivers
which drain these basins flow through them very irregularly, but
by means of their main trunks and the tributaries, water communication
is easily kept up, not only from west to east along
the great courses, but also across the country. These natural
facilities for inland navigation have been greatly improved by
the people, but they still, in most cases, await the introduction
of steam to assist them in stemming the rapid currents of some
of their rivers, and bringing distant places into more frequent
communication.</p>

<p>The whole surface of China may be conveniently divided into
the mountainous and hilly country and the Great Plain. The
mountainous country comprehends more than half of the whole,
lying west of the meridian of 112° or 114° (nearly that of Canton),
quite to the borders of Tibet. The hilly portion is that
south of the Yangtsz’ kiang and east of this meridian, comprising
the provinces of Fuhkien, Kiangsí, Kwangtung, and sections
of Hunan and Hupeh. The Great Plain lies in the north-east,
and forms the richest part of the empire.</p>

<p>This Plain extends in length 700 miles from the Great Wall
and Barrier Range north of Peking to the confluence of
Poyang Lake with the Yangtsz’ in Kiangsí, lat. 30° N. The
latter river is considered as its southern boundary as far down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
as Nganking in Nganhwui, whence to the sea it is formed by a
line drawn nearly east through Hangchau. The western boundary
may be marked by a line drawn from Kingchau in Hupeh
(lat. 30° 36′), nearly north to Hwaiking, on the Yellow River,
and thence due north to the Great Wall, 50 miles north-west of
Peking. The breadth varies. North of lat. 35°, where it
partly extends to the Yellow Sea, and partly borders on the
western side of Shantung, thence across to the Bear Mountains
and Shansí, its measure is between 150 and 250 miles; stating
the average at 200 miles, this portion has an area of 70,000
square miles. Between 34° and 35° the Plain enlarges, and in
the parallel of the Yellow River has a breadth of some 300
miles from east to west; while further south, along the course
of the Yangtsz’, it reaches nearly 400 miles inland. Estimating
the mean breadth of this portion at 400 miles, there are
140,000 square miles, which, with the northern part, make an
area of about 210,000 square miles&mdash;a surface seven times as
large as that of Lombardy, and about the same area as the
plain of Bengal drained by the Ganges. The northern portion
in Chihlí up to the edge of the Plateau is mostly a deposit
of the yellow loess and alluvial on the river bottoms;
that lying near the coast in Kiangsu is low and swampy, covered
by lakes and intersected by water-courses. This portion
is extremely fertile, and furnishes large quantities of silk, tea,
cotton, grain, and tobacco. The most interesting feature of this
Plain is the enormous population it supports, which is, according
to the census of 1812, not less than 177 millions of human
beings, if the whole number of inhabitants contained in the six
provinces lying wholly or partly in it be included; making it
by far the most densely settled of any part of the world of the
same size, and amounting to nearly two-thirds of the whole
population of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREAT WALL.</div>

<p>The public works of China are probably unequalled in any
land or by any people, for the amount of human labor bestowed
upon them; the natural aspect of the country has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
materially changed by them, and it has been remarked that
the Great Wall is the only artificial structure which would
arrest attention in a hasty survey of the surface of the globe.
But their usefulness, or the science exhibited in their construction,
is far inferior to their extent. The Great Wall,
called <i>Wan-lí Chang Ching</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, Myriad-mile Wall), was built
by Tsin Chí-hwangtí, in order to protect his dominions from
the incursions of the northern tribes. Some portions of it
were already in existence, and he formed the plan of joining
and extending them along the whole northern frontier to
guard it. It was finished <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 204, having been ten years in
building, seven of which were done after the Emperor’s death.
This gigantic work was probably a popular one in the main,
and still remains as its own chief evidence of the energy,
industry, and perseverance of its builders, as well as their
unwisdom and waste. Its construction probably cost less than
the usual sums spent by European States for their standing
armies. It commences at Shanhai wei or Shanhai kwan (lat.
40°, long. 119° 50′), a coast town of some importance as on
the boundary between Chihlí and Shingking, and a place of
considerable trade. Lord Jocelyn describes the wall, when
observed from the ships, as “scaling the precipices and topping
the craggy hills of the country, which have along this
coast a most desolate appearance.”</p>

<p>It runs along the shore for several miles, and terminates on
the beach near a long reef. Its course from this point is
west, a little northerly, along the old frontiers of the province
of Chihlí, and then in Shansí, till it strikes the Yellow River,
in lat. 39&frac12;° and long. 111&frac12;°. This is the best built part, and
contains the most important gates, where garrisons and trading
marts are established. Within the province of Chihlí there
are two walls, inclosing a good part of the basin of the Sangkan
ho west of Peking; the inner one was built by an emperor
of the Ming dynasty. From the point where it strikes the
Yellow River, near Pau-teh, it forms the northern boundary of
Shensí, till it touches that stream again in lat. 37°, inclosing
the country of the Ortous Mongols. Its direction from this
point is north-west along the northern frontier of Kansuh to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
its termination near Kiayü kwan, through which the road
passes leading to Hami.</p>

<p>From near the eastern extremity of the Wall in the province
of Chihlí, extending in a north-easterly direction, there
was once a wooden stockade or palisade, forming the boundary
between Liautung and Kirin, which has been often taken from
its representation on maps as a continuation of the Great Wall.
It was erected by the Manchus, but has long since become decayed
and disused.</p>

<p>The entire length of the Great Wall between its extremities
is 22&frac12; degrees of latitude, or 1,255 miles in a straight line;
but its turnings and doublings increase it to fully 1,500 miles.
It would stretch from Philadelphia to Topeka, or from Portugal
to Naples, on nearly the same latitude. The construction
of this gigantic work is somewhat adapted to the nature of the
country it traverses, and the material was taken or made on
the spot where it was used. In the western part of its course,
it is in some places merely a mud or gravel wall, and in others
earth cased with brick.</p>

<p>The eastern part is generally composed of earth and pebbles
faced with large bricks, weighing from 40 to 60 lbs. each,
supported on a coping of stone. The whole is about 25 feet
thick at the base, and 15 feet at the top, and varying from 15
to 30 feet high; the top is protected with bricks, and defended
by a slight parapet, the thinness of which has been taken as
proof that cannon were unknown at the time it was erected.
There are brick towers at different intervals, some of them
more than 40 feet high, but not built upon the Wall. These
are independent structures, usually about 40 feet square at the
base, diminishing to 30 at the top; at particular spots the
towers are of two stories.</p>

<p>The impression left upon the mind of a foreigner, on seeing
this monument of human toil and unremunerative outlay, is respect
for a people that could in any manner build it. Standing
on the peak at <i>Ku-peh Kau</i> (Old North Gate), one sees the cloud-capped
towers extending away over the declivities in single files
both east and west, until dwarfed by miles and miles of skyward
perspective as they dwindle into minute piles, yet stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
with solemn stillness where they were stationed twenty centuries
ago, as though condemned to wait the march of time
till their builders returned. The crumbling dike at their feet
may be followed, winding, leaping across gorges, defiles, and
steeps, now buried in some chasm, now scaling the cliffs and
slopes, in very exuberance of power and wantonness, as it
vanishes in a thin, shadowy line, at the horizon. Once seen,
the Great Wall of China can never be forgotten.</p>

<p>At present this remarkable structure is simply a geographical
boundary, and except at the Gates nothing is done to
keep it in repair. Beyond the Yellow River to its western
extremity, the Great Wall, according to Gerbillon, is mostly a
mound of earth or gravel, about fifteen feet in height, with
only occasional towers of brick, or gateways made of stone.
At Kalgan portions of it are made of porphyry and other stones
piled up in a pyramidal form between the brick towers, difficult
to cross but easy enough to pull down. The appearance of this
rampart at Ku-peh kau is more imposing; the entire extent of
the main and cross walls in sight from one of the towers there
is over twenty miles. In one place it runs over a peak 5,225
feet high, where it is so steep as to make one wonder as much
at the labor of erecting it on such a cliff as on the folly of supposing
it could be of any use there as a defence. The wall is
most visited at Nan-kau (South Gate), in the Ku-yung Pass,
a remarkable Thermopyla fifteen miles in length, which leads
from the Plain at Peking up to the first terrace above it, and
at one time was guarded by five additional walls and gates,
now all in ruins. From this spot, the wall reaches across
Shansí, and was built at a later period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GRAND CANAL.</div>

<p>The other great public work is the Grand Canal, or <i>Chah
ho</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, river of Flood-gates), called also <i>Yun ho</i> or ‘Transit
River,’ an enterprise which reflects far more credit upon the
monarchs who devised and executed it, than does the Great
Wall, and if the time in which it was dug, and the character
of the princes who planned it, be considered, few works can
be mentioned in the history of any country more admirable
and useful. When it was in order, before the inflow of the
Yellow River failed, by means of its connection with its feeders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
an uninterrupted water communication across the country from
Peking to Canton existed, and goods and passengers passed
from the capital to nearly every large town in the basins of the
two great rivers. The canal was designed by Kublai to reach
from his own capital as far as Hangchau, the former capital of
the Sung dynasty, and cannot be better described than in
Marco Polo’s language: “You must understand that the Emperor
has caused a water communication to be made from this
city [Kwa-chau] to Cambaluc, in the shape of a wide and
deep channel dug between stream and stream, between lake and
lake, forming as it were a great river on which large vessels
can ply.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The northern end is a channel fourteen miles long,
from Tung-chau up to Peking, which, passing under the city
walls, finishes its course of some 600 miles at the palace wall,
close by the British Legation; here it is called <i>Yu ho</i>, or ‘Imperial
River,’ but all boats now unlade at the eastern gate. An
abridged account of Davis’s observations<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> will afford a good idea
of its construction and appearance.</p>

<p>“Early on the 23d September, we entered the canal through
two stone piers and between very high banks. The mounds
of earth in the immediate vicinity were evidently for the purpose
of effecting repairs, which, to judge from the vestiges of
inundation on either side, could not be infrequent. The canal
joins the Yu ho, which we had just quitted, on its eastern
bank, as that river flows towards the Pei ho. One of the
most striking features of the canal is the comparative clearness
of its waters, when contrasted with that of the two rivers
on which we had hitherto travelled; a circumstance reasonably
attributable to the depositions occasioned by the greater stillness
of its contents. The course of the canal at this point
was evidently in the bed of a natural river, as might be perceived
from its winding course, and the irregularity and inartificial
appearance of its banks. The stone abutments and
flood-gates are for the purpose of regulating its waters, which
at present were in excess and flowing out of it. As we proceeded
on the canal, the stone flood-gates or sluices occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
at the rate of three or four a day, sometimes oftener, according
as the inequalities in the surface of the country rendered them
necessary....</p>

<p>“As we advanced, the canal in some parts became narrower,
and the banks had rather more of an artificial appearance than
where we first entered it, being occasionally pretty high; but
still the winding course led to the inference, that as yet the
canal was for the most part only a natural river, modified and
regulated by sluices and embankments. The distance between
the stone piers in some of the flood-gates was apparently so
narrow as only just to admit the passage of our largest boats.
The contrivance for arresting the course of the water through
them was extremely simple; stout boards, with ropes fastened
to each end, were let down edgewise over each other through
grooves in the stone piers. A number of soldiers and workmen
always attended at the sluices, and the danger to the boats
was diminished by coils of rope being hung down at the sides
to break the force of blows. The slowness of our progress,
which for the last week averaged only twenty miles a day,
gave us abundant leisure to observe the country....</p>

<p>“We now began to make better progress on the canal than
we had hitherto done. The stream, though against us, was
not strong, except near the sluices, where it was confined. In
the afternoon we stopped at Kai-ho chin (<i>i.e.</i>, River-opening
mart), so called, perhaps, because the canal was commenced near
here. On the 28th we arrived at the influx of the Yun ho,
where the stream turned in our favor, and flowed to the southward,
being the highest point of the canal, and a place of some
note. The Yun ho flows into the canal on its eastern side
nearly at right angles, and a part of its waters flow north and
part south, while a strong facing of stone on the western bank
sustains the force of the influx. At this point is the temple
of the Dragon King, or genius of the watery element, who is
supposed to have the canal in his special keeping. This enterprise
of leading in this river seems to have been the work
of Sung Lí, who lived under Hungwu, the first emperor of the
Ming dynasty, about 1375. In his time, a part of the canal
in Shantung became so impassable that the coasting passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
by sea began to be most used. This was the very thing the
canal had been intended to prevent; Sung accordingly adopted
the plan of an old man named Píying, to concentrate the
waters of the Yun ho and neighboring streams, and bring
them down upon the canal as they are at present. History
states that Sung employed 300,000 men to carry the plan into
operation, and that the work was completed in seven months.
On both sides of us, nearly level with the canal, were extensive
swamps with a shallow covering of water, planted with the Nelumbium;
they were occasionally separated by narrow banks,
along which the trackers walked, and the width of the canal
sometimes did not exceed twenty-five yards. On reaching the
part which skirts the Tu-shan Lake, the left bank was entirely
submerged, and the canal confounded with the lake. All
within sight was swamp, coldness, and desolation&mdash;in fact, a
vast inland sea, as many of the large boats at a distance were
hull down. The swamps on the following day were kept out
of sight by some decent villages on the high banks, which
from perpetual accumulation assumed in some places the aspect
of hills.</p>

<p>“A part of our journey on the first of October lay along a portion
of the canal where the banks, particularly to the right, were
elaborately and thoroughly faced with stone; a precaution
which seemed to imply a greater than ordinary danger from
inundations. In fact, the lakes, or rather floods, seemed to extend
at present nearly to the feet of the mountains which lay
at a distance on our left. We were now approaching that part
of China which is exposed to the disastrous overflowings of the
Yellow River, a perpetual source of wasteful expenditure to
the government, and of peril and calamity to the people; it
well deserves the name of China’s Sorrow. We observed the
repairs of the banks diligently proceeding under the superintendence
of the proper officer. For this purpose they use the
natural soil in combination with the thick stalks of the gigantic
millet.”</p>

<p>The canal reaches the Yellow River about 70 miles from its
mouth; but before leaving the lakes in the southern part of
Shantung, it used to run nearly parallel with that stream for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
more than a hundred miles, and between it and the New Salt
River during a good part of this distance. It is hard to understand
how, by natural causes, so powerful a river, as it is described
to be by the historians of both the British embassies
less than one hundred years ago, should have become so completely
choked up. The difference of level near Kaifung is
found to be so very little that the siltage there has been enough
to turn the current into the river Wei and elsewhere. When Amherst’s
embassy passed, the boats struck right across the stream,
and gained the opposite bank, about three-fourths of a mile
distant, in less than an hour. They drifted about two miles
down, and then slowly brought up against the current to the
spot where the canal entered. This opening was a sluice nearly
a hundred yards across, and through it the waters rushed into
the river like a mill-race; the banks were constructed of earth,
strengthened with sorghum stalks, and strongly bound with cordage.
Sir John Davis remarks, with the instinct of a tradesman,
as he commends the perseverance and industry which had
overcome these obstacles, that if the science of a Brunel could
be allowed to operate on the Yellow River and Grand Canal, “a
benefit might be conferred on the Chinese that would more
than compensate for all the evil that we have inflicted with our
opium and our guns.” The boats were dragged through and
up the sluice close to the bank by ropes communicating with
large windlasses worked on the bank, which safely, though
slowly, brought them into still water.</p>

<p>The distance between the Yellow and Yangtsz’ rivers is about
ninety miles, and the canal here is carried largely upon a raised
work of earth, kept together by retaining walls of stone, and
not less than twenty feet above the surrounding country in
some parts. This sheet of water is about two hundred feet wide,
and its current nearly three miles an hour. South of the Hwang
ho several large towns stand near the levees, below their level,
whose safety wholly depends upon the care taken of the banks
of the canal. Hwai-ngan and Pauying lie thus under and near
them, in such a position as to cause an involuntary shudder at
the thought of the destruction which would take place if they
should give way. The level descends from these towns to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the Yangtsz’, and at Yangchau the canal is much below the
houses on its sides. It also connects with every stream or
lake whose waters can be led into it. There are two or three
inlets into the Yangtsz’ where the canal reaches the northern
bank, but Chinkiang, on the southern shore, is regarded as
the principal defence and post of its crossing. The canal
leaves the river east of that city, proceeds south-east to
Suchau, and thence southerly on the eastern side of lake Tai,
with which it communicates, to Hangchau in Chehkiang. This
portion is by far the most interesting and picturesque of the
whole line, owing to its rich and populous cities, the fertility
and high cultivation of the banks, and the lively aspect imparted
by the multitude of boats. Though Kublai has had the credit
of this useful work, it existed in parts of its course long before
his day. The reach between the two great rivers was opened
in the Han dynasty, and repaired by the wise founder of the
Sui dynasty (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 600). The princes of the Tang dynasty kept
it open, and when the Sung emperors lived at Hangchau they
made the extension up to Chinkiang the great highway which
it is to this day. The work from Peking to the Yellow
River was opened by the Mongols about 1289, in which they
merely joined the rivers and lakes to each other as they now
exist. The Ming and Tsing emperors have done all they could
to keep it open throughout, and lately an attempt has been
made to reopen the passage from Hungtsih Lake north into the
old bed, so that boats can reach Tientsin from Kwachau. Its
entire length is about 650 miles, or not quite twice that of the
Erie Canal, but it varies in its breadth and depth more than
any important canal either of America or Europe.</p>

<p>As a work of art, compared with canals now existing in western
countries, the Transit River does not rank high; but even
at this day there is no work of the kind in Asia which can compare
with it, and there was none in the world equal to it when
first put in full operation. It passes through alluvial soil in
every part of its course, and the chief labor was expended in
constructing embankments, and not in digging a deep channel.
The junction of the Yun ho, about lat. 36° N., was probably
taken as the summit level. From this point northward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
trench was dug through to Lintsing to join the Yu ho, and embankments
thrown up from the same place southward to the
Yellow River, the whole being a line of two hundred miles. In
some places the bed is cut down thirty, forty, and even seventy
feet, but it encountered no material obstacle. The sluices which
keep the necessary level are of rude construction, and thick
planks, sliding in grooves hewn in stone buttresses, form the
only locks. Still, the objects intended are all fully gained, and
the simplicity of the means certainly does not derogate from
the merit and execution of the plan.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CANALS.</div>

<p>There are some other inferior canals in the empire. Kienlung
constructed a waste-weir for carrying off the surplus waters
of the Yellow River of about a hundred miles in length, by
cutting a canal from Ífung hien in Honan, to one of the principal
affluents of lake Hungtsih. It also answered as a drain for
the marshy land in that part, and has probably recently served
to convey the floods from the main stream into the lake. In
the vicinity of Canton and Suchau are many channels cut
through the plains, which serve both for irrigation and navigation,
but they are not worthy the name of canals. Similar conveniences
are more or less frequently met with in all parts of
the provinces, notably those on the Plain and low coast-lands.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A Road-Cut in the Loess.</p></div>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">PUBLIC ROADS.</div>

<p>The public roads, in a country so well provided with navigable
streams, are of minor consequence, but these media of travel
are not neglected. “I have travelled near 600 leagues by land
in China,” observes De Guignes, “and have found many good
roads, most of them wide and planted with trees. They are
not usually paved, and consequently in rainy weather are either
channelled by the water or covered with mud, and in dry weather
so dusty that travellers are obliged to wear spectacles to protect
their eyes. In Kwangtung transportation is performed almost
wholly by water, the only roads being across the lines of navigation.
The pass across the Mei ling is paved or filled up with
stones; at Kih-ngan, in Kiangsí, are paved roads in good condition,
but beyond the Yangtsz’, in Nganhwui, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
almost impracticable, but became better as we proceeded
northward, and in many places had trees on both sides. Beyond
the Hwang ho
they were broader,
and we saw crowds
of travellers, carts,
mules, and horses.
In Shantung and
Chihlí they were
generally broad and
shady, and very
dusty. This is, no
doubt, disagreeable,
but we went smoothly
over these places,
while in the villages
and towns we
were miserably jolted
on the pavements.
I hope, for
the sake of those
who may come
after me, that the
Chinese will not
pave their roads before
they improve
their carriages.
Some of the thoroughfares
leading
to Peking are paved
with thick slabs of
stone. One feature
of the roads through
the northern provinces
which attracts
attention is the
great number that lie below the level of the country. It is
caused by the wind sweeping along them, and carrying over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the fields the dust made and raised by the carts. As soon
as the pools left by the rains dry enough to let the carts pass,
the earth is reduced to powder; as the winds sweep through
the passage and clear it out, the process in a few years cuts
a defile through the loam often fifteen feet deep, which impedes
travel by its narrow gauge, hindering the carts as they
meet. The banks are protected by revetment walls or turf, if
necessary. Those near Hangchau, and the great road leading
from Chehkiang into Kiangsí, are all in good condition. Generally
speaking, however, as is the case with most things in
China, the roads are not well repaired, and large holes are frequently
allowed to remain unfilled in the path, to the great
danger of those who travel by night.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>


<p>Mountain passes have been cut for facilitating the transit of
goods and people over the high ranges in many parts of the
empire. The great road leading from Peking south-west
through Shansí and Shensí, and thence to Sz’chuen, is carried
across the Peh ling and the valley of the river Hwai by a mountain
road, “which, for the difficulties it presents and the art
and labor with which they have been overcome, does not appear
to be inferior to the road over the Simplon.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> At one place on
this route, called Lí-nai, a passage has been cut through the
rock, and steps hewn on both sides of the mountain from its
base to the summit. The passage across the peak being only
wide enough for one sedan, the guards are perched in little
houses placed on poles over the pass. This road was in ancient
times the path to the metropolis, and these immense excavations
were made from time to time by different monarchs. The pass
over the Mei ling, at Nan-ngan, is a work of later date, and so
are most of the other roads across this range in Fuhkien and
Kwangtung.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENERAL ASPECT AND RACE TYPES.</div>

<p>The general aspect of the country is perhaps as much modi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>fied
by labor of man in China as in England, but the appearance
of a landscape in the two kingdoms is unlike. Whenever
water is available, streams are led upon the rice fields, and this
kind of cultivation allows few or no trees to grow in the plats.
Such fields are divided by raised banks, which serve for pathways
across the marshy enclosure, and assist in confining the
water when let in upon the growing crop. The bounds of other
fields are denoted by stones or other landmarks, and the entire
absence of walls, fences, or hedgerows, makes a cultivated plain
appear like a vast garden.</p>

<p>The greatest sameness exists in all the cities. A wall encloses
all towns above a <i>sz’</i> or township, and the suburbs are not unfrequently
larger than their enceinte. The streets in large
towns south of the Hwang ho are paved, and the sewers run
under the cross slabs. What filth is not in them is generally in
the street, as these drains easily become choked. The roadways
are not usually over ten feet wide, but the low houses on each
side make them appear less like alleys than would be the case
in western cities. Villages have a pleasant appearance at a distance,
usually embowered among trees, between which the
whitewashed houses look prettily; but on entering them one is
disappointed at their irregularity, dirtiness, and generally decayed
look. The gardens and best houses are mostly walled in
from sight, while the precincts of temples are the resort of
idlers, beggars, and children, with a proportion of pigs and
dogs.</p>

<p>Elegance or ornament, orderly arrangement and grandeur
of design, cleanliness, or comfort, as these terms are applied in
Europe, are almost unknown in Chinese houses, cities, or gardens.
Commanding or agreeable situations are chosen for temples
and monasteries, which are not only the abode of priests
but serve for inns, theatres, and other purposes. The terrace
cultivation sometimes renders the acclivities of hills beautiful
in the highest degree, but it does not often impart a distinguishing
feature to the landscape. A lofty solitary pagoda, an extensive
temple shaded by trees in the opening of a vale, a commemorative
<i>pai-lau</i>, or boats moving in every direction through
narrow creeks or on broad streams, are some of the peculiar lin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>eaments
of Chinese scenery. No imposing mansions with beautiful
grounds are found on the skirts of a town, for the people
huddle together in hamlets and villages for mutual aid and security.
No tapering spires pointing out the rural church, nor
towers, pillars, domes, or steeples in the cities, indicating buildings
of public utility, rise upon the low level of dun-tiled roofs.
No meadows or pastures, containing herds and flocks, are visible
from the hill-tops in China; nor are coaches or railroad cars
observed hurrying across its landscapes. Steamers have just
begun to course through some of its rivers, and disturb, by their
whistles and wheels, the drowsy silence of past ages and the slow
progress of unwieldy junks&mdash;the other changes have yet to come.</p>

<p>The condition and characteristics of the various families of
man inhabiting this great empire, render its study far more interesting
than anything relating to its physical geography or
public works. The Chinese forms the leading family, but the
Miaotsz’, the Li-mu, the Kakyens, and other aborigines in the
southern provinces, the Manchus, the Mongols, and various
Tartar tribes, the Tibetans, and certain wild races in Kirin and
Formosa, must not be overlooked. The sons of Han are indeed
a remarkable race, whether regard be had to their antiquity,
their numbers, their government, or their literature, and on
these accounts deserve the study and respect of every intelligent
student of mankind; while their unwearied industry, their general
peaceableness and good humor, and their attainments in
domestic order and mechanical arts, commend them to the notice
of every one who sees in these points of character an earnest
of their future position amid the great family of civilized
nations when once they shall have attained the same.</p>

<p>The physical traits of the Chinese may be described as being
between the light and agile Hindu, and the muscular, fleshy
European. Their form is well built and symmetrical; their
color is a brunette or sickly white, rather approaching to a yellowish
than to a florid tint, but this yellow hue has been much
exaggerated; in the south they are swarthy but not black, never
becoming as dark even as the Portuguese, whose fifth or sixth
ancestors dwelt near the Tagus. The shades of complexion
differ much according to the latitude and degree of exposure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the weather, especially in the females. The hair of the head is
lank, black, coarse, and glossy; beard always black, thin, and
deficient; scanty or no whiskers; and very little hair on the
body. Eyes invariably black, and apparently oblique, owing to
the slight degree in which the inner angles of the eyelids open,
the internal canthi being more acute than in western races, and
not allowing the whole iris to be seen; this peculiarity in the
eye distinguishes the eastern races of Asia from all other families
of man. There is a marked difference between the features
of the mixed race living south of the Mei ling, and the inhabitants
of the Great Plain and in Shansí or further west; the latter
are the finer appearing. The hair and eyes being always
black, a European with blue eyes and light hair appears strange
to them; one reason given by the people of Canton for calling
foreigners <i>fan kwei</i>, or ‘foreign devils,’ is, that they have
sunken blue eyes, and red hair like demons.</p>

<p>The cheek-bones are high, and the outline of the face remarkably
round. The nose is rather small, much depressed, nearly
even with the face at the root, and wide at the extremity; there
is, however, considerable difference in this respect, but no aquiline
noses are seen. Lips thicker than among Europeans, but
not at all approaching those of the negro. The hands are small,
and the lower limbs better proportioned than among any other
Asiatics. The height of those living north of the Yangtsz’ is
about the same as that of Europeans. A thousand men taken
as they come in the streets of Canton, will hardly equal in
stature and weight the same number in Rome or New Orleans,
while they would, perhaps, exceed these, if gathered in Peking;
their muscular powers, however, would probably be less in
either Chinese city than in those of Europe or America.</p>

<p>In size, the women are smaller than European females; and
in the eyes of those accustomed to the European style of beauty,
the Chinese women possess little; the broad upper face, low
nose, and linear eyes, being quite the contrary of handsome.
Nevertheless, the Chinese face is not destitute of beauty,
and when animated with good humor and an expressive eye,
and lighted by the glow of youth and health, the features lose
much of their repulsiveness. Nor do they fade so soon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
look as ugly and withered when old as some travellers say, but
are in respect to bearing children and keeping their vigor, more
like Europeans than the Hindus or Persians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABORIGINAL TRIBES.</div>

<p>The mountainous regions in Yunnan, Kwangsí, and Kweichau,
give lodgement to many clans of the Miaotsz’ or “children
of the soil,” as the words may be rendered. It is singular that
any of these people should have maintained their independence
so long, when so large a portion of them have partially submitted
to Chinese rule. Those who will not are called <i>săng
Miaotsz’</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, wild or ‘unsubdued,’ while the others are termed
<i>shuh</i> or ‘subdued.’ They present so many physical points of
difference as to lead one to infer that they are a more ancient
race than the Chinese around them, and the aborigines of
Southern China. They are rather smaller in size and stature,
have shorter necks, and their features are somewhat more
angular. They are divided into many tribes, and have been
described by Chinese travellers, who have illustrated their habits
by paintings and sketches, from which a good idea can be
obtained of their condition. Dr. Bridgman has translated such
an account, written by a Chinese native traveller, in which he
sketches the manners of eighty-two clans, especially those customs
relating to worship and marriage, showing how little they
have learned from their rulers or improved from the savage
state. An examination of their languages shows that those of
the Miaotsz’ proper have strong affinities with the Siamese and
Annamese, and those known as <i>Lolo</i> exhibit a decided likeness
to the Burmese. The former of these are mentioned in Chinese
history during 4,000 years; the latter about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 250, when a
Shan nation came under Chinese influence in Yunnan, and was
the object of a warlike expedition. The same race still remain
on the Upper Irrawadi and in Assam as Shans and Khamti, and
in the basins of the Meinam and Mei-lung, all of them akin to
the Tibetans and Burmese. They form together an interesting
relic of the ancient peoples of the land, and further inquiries
will doubtless develop something of their history and origin.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>An aboriginal race&mdash;the <i>Li-mu</i>&mdash;exists in the centre of Hainan,
an offset from the Miaotsz’, judging by the little that is
known of their language. The natives of Formosa seem to
have more affinity with their neighbors in Luzon and southward
than with the Chinese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANCHUS AND MONGOLS.</div>

<p>The Mongol and Manchu races have been considered as
springing from the same stock, but during centuries of separation
under different circumstances they have altered much.
The Mongols are essentially a nomadic race, while the Manchus
are an agricultural or a hunting people, according to the part of
their country they inhabit. The Manchus are of a lighter complexion
and somewhat larger than the Chinese, have the same
conformation of the eyelids, but rather more beard, while their
countenances indicate greater intellectual capacity. They seem
to partake of both the Mongol and Chinese character, possessing
more determination and largeness of plan than the latter,
with much of the rudeness and haughtiness of the former.
They have fair, if not florid, complexions, straight noses, and,
in a few cases, brown hair and heavy beards. They are more
allied to the Chinese, and when they ruled the northern provinces
as the Kin dynasty, amalgamated with them. They may
be regarded as the most improvable race in Central Asia, if not
on the continent; and the skill with which they have governed
the Chinese empire, and adopted a civilization higher than their
own, gives promise of still further advances when they become
familiar with the civilization of Christian lands.</p>

<p>Under the term Mongols or Moguls a great number of tribes
occupying the steppes of Central Asia are comprised. They
extend from the borders of the Khirgís steppe and Kokand
eastward to the Sialkoi Mountains, and it is particularly to this
race that the name <i>Tartars</i> or <i>Tatars</i> is applicable. No such
word is now known among the people, except as an ignominious
epithet, by the Chinese, who usually write it with two characters&mdash;<i>tah-tsz’</i>&mdash;meaning
‘trodden-down people.’ Klaproth
confines the appellation of <i>Tartars</i> to the Mongols, Kalmucks,
Kalkas, Eleuths, and Buriats, while the Kirghís, Usbecks, Cossacks,
and Turks are of Kurdish and <i>Turkoman</i> origin.</p>

<p>The Mongol tribes generally are a stout, squat, swarthy, ill-favored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
race of men, having high and broad shoulders, short,
broad noses, pointed and prominent chins, long teeth distant
from each other, eyes black, elliptical, and unsteady, thick, short
necks, extremities bony and nervous, muscular thighs, but short
legs, with a stature nearly or quite equal to the European.
They have a written language, but their literature is limited
and mostly religious. The same language is spoken by all the
tribes, with slight variations and only a small admixture of
foreign words. Most of the accounts of their origin, their wars,
and their habits, were written by foreigners living or travelling
among them; but they themselves, as McCulloch remarks, know
as little of these things as rats or marmots do of their descent.
Yet it is not so easy to find the typical Mongol among the medley
of nationalities in their towns. A crowd in a town like
Yarkand exhibits all the varieties of the human race. The
gaunt, almost beardless Manchu, with sunken eyes, high cheek-bones,
and projecting jowl, contrasts with the smooth face,
pinky yellow, oblique eye, flat cheeks, and rounded jowl of the
Chinese. The bearded, sallow Toork, the angular, rosy Kirghís,
the coarse, hard Dungani, and thick-lipped, square-faced Eleuth,
all show poorly with the tall, handsome Cashmerian, the swarthy
Badakshi, and robust, intelligent Uzbek. The fate of the vast
swarms of this race which have descended from the table-land
of Central Asia and overrun, in different ages, the plains of
India, China, Syria, Egypt, and Eastern Europe, and the rise
and fall of the gigantic empire they themselves erected under
Genghis in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, are among the
most remarkable episodes in the world’s history. They have
always maintained the same character in their native wilds,
their conquests have been exterminations rather than subjugations,
their history a record of continual quarrels between
clans.</p>

<p>The last of the five races is the Tibetan, who partake of the
physical characteristics of the Mongols and Hindus. They are
short, squat, and broad-shouldered in body, with angular faces,
wide, high cheek-bones, small black eyes, and scant beard.
They are mild in disposition, have a stronger religious feeling
than the Chinese, and have never left their own highlands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
either for emigration or conquest. Their civilization is fully
equal to that of the Siamese and Burmese, and life and property
are more secure with them than among their turbulent
neighbors in Butan, Lahore, or Cabul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CIVILIZATION PAST AND FUTURE.</div>

<p>It will be seen from this short survey that a full account of
the geography, government, manners, literature, and civilization
of so large a part of the world and its inhabitants requires the
combined labors of many observers, all of them well acquainted
with the languages and institutions of the people whom they
describe. No one will look, therefore, for more than a brief
outline of these subjects in the present work, minute enough,
however, to enable readers to form a fair opinion of the people.
It is the <em>industry</em> of the Chinese which has given them their
high place among the nations of the earth. Not only has the
indigenous vegetation been superseded wherever culture would
remunerate toil, but lofty hills have been tilled and terraced
almost to their tops, cities have been built upon them, and
extensive ranges of wall erected along their summits. They
practise all the industrial arts whose objects are to feed, clothe,
educate or adorn mankind, and maintain the largest population
ever united under one system of rule. Ten centuries ago they
were the most civilized nation on earth, and the incredulity
manifested in Europe, five hundred years ago, at the recitals of
Marco Polo regarding their condition, is the counterpart of the
sentiments now expressed by the Chinese when they hear of
the power and grandeur of western nations.</p>

<p>Isolated by natural boundaries from other peoples, their civilization,
developed under peculiar influences, must be compared
to, rather than judged of, by European. A people from whom
some of the most distinguishing inventions of modern Europe
came (such as the compass, porcelain, gunpowder, and printing),
and were known and practised many centuries earlier; who
probably amount to more than three hundred millions, united
in one system of manners, letters, and polity; whose cities and
capitals rival in numbers the greatest metropoles of any age;
who have not only covered the earth, but the waters, with
towns and streets&mdash;such a nation must occupy a conspicuous
place in the history of mankind, and the study of their char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>acter
and condition commend itself to every well-wisher of his
race.</p>

<p>It has been too much the custom of writers to overlook the
influence of the Bible upon modern civilization; but when a
comparison is to be drawn between European and Asiatic civilization,
this element forces itself upon the attention as the
main cause of the superiority of the former. It is not the civilization
of luxury or of letters, of arts or of priestcraft; it is
not the spirit of war, the passion for money, nor its exhibitions
in trade and the application of machinery, that render a nation
permanently great and prosperous. “Christianity is the summary
of all civilization,” says Chenevix; “it contains every argument
which could be urged in its support, and every precept
which explains its nature. Former systems of religion were in
conformity with luxury, but this alone seems to have been conceived
for the region of civilization. It has flourished in Europe,
while it has decayed in Asia, and the most civilized nations
are the most purely Christian.” Christianity is essentially
the religion of the people, and when it is covered over with
forms and contracted into a priesthood, its vitality goes out;
this is one reason why it has declined in Asia. The attainments
of the Chinese in the arts of life are perhaps as great as
they can be without this spring of action, without any other
motives to industry, obedience, and morality, than the commands
or demands of the present life.</p>

<p>A survey of the world and its various races in successive
ages leads one to infer that God has some plan of national
character, and that one nation exhibits the development of
one trait, while another race gives prominence to another, and
subordinates the first. Thus the Egyptian people were eminently
a priestly race, devoted to science and occult lore; the
Greeks developed the imaginative powers, excelling in the
fine arts; the Romans were warlike, and the embodiment of
force and law; the Babylonians and Persians magnificent,
like the head of gold in Daniel’s vision; the Arabs predacious,
volatile, and imaginative; the Turks stolid, bigoted,
and impassible; the Hindus are contemplative, religious, and
metaphysical; the Chinese industrious, peaceful, literary, athe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>istic,
and self-contained.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The same religion, and constant intercommunication
among European nations, has assimilated
them more than these other races ever could have become; but
every one knows the national peculiarities of the Spaniards,
Italians, French, English, etc., and how they are maintained,
notwithstanding the motives to imitation and coalescence. The
comparison of national character and civilization, with the
view of ascertaining such a plan, is a subject worthy the profound
study of any scholar, and one which would offer new
views of the human race. The Chinese would be found to
have attained, it is believed, a higher position in general security
of life and property, and in the arts of domestic life and
comfort among the mass, and a greater degree of general literary
intelligence, than any other heathen or Mohammedan nation
that ever existed&mdash;or indeed than some now calling themselves
Christian, as Abyssinia. They have, however, probably
done all they can do, reached as high a point as they can without
the Gospel; and its introduction, with its attendant influences,
will erelong change their political and social system. The
rise and progress of this revolution among so mighty a mass of
human beings will form one of the most interesting parts of
the history of the world during the nineteenth century, and
solve the problem whether it be possible to elevate a race without
the intermediate steps of disorganization and reconstruction.</p>

<span class="smaller">GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE EASTERN PROVINCES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The provinces of China Proper are politically subdivided in a
scientific manner, but in the regions beyond them, these divisions
are considerably modified. Manchuria is regarded as belonging
to the reigning family, somewhat as Hanover once pertained
to the kings of England, and its scanty population is
ruled by a simple military organization, the higher officials being
appointed by his majesty himself. The khans of the Mongols
in Mongolia and Ílí, the Mohammedan begs in Turkestan,
and the lamas in Tibet, are assisted in their rule by Chinese
residents and generals who direct and uphold the government.</p>

<p>The geography of foreign countries has not been studied by
the Chinese; and so few educated men have travelled even into
the islands of the Indian Archipelago, or the kingdoms of Siam,
Corea, or Burmah, that the people have had no opportunity to
become acquainted with the countries lying on their borders,
much less with those in remoter parts, whose names, even, they
hardly know. A few native works exist on foreign geography,
among which four may be here noticed. “1. <cite>Researches in
the East and West</cite>, 6 vols. 8vo. It was written about two centuries
ago; the first volume contains some rude charts intended
to show the situation and form of foreign countries. 2. <cite>Notices
of the Seas</cite>, 1 vol. Its author, Yang Ping-nan, obtained his information
from a townsman, who, being wrecked at sea, was
picked up by a foreign ship, and travelled abroad for fourteen
years; on his return to China he became blind, and was engaged
as an interpreter in Macao. 3. <cite>Notices of Things heard
and seen in Foreign Countries</cite>, 2 vols. 12mo; written about a
century ago, containing among other things a chart of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Chinese coast. 4. <cite>The Memoranda of Foreign Tribes</cite>, 4 vols.
8vo, published in the reign of Kienlung.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> A more methodical
work is that of Lí Tsing-lai, called ‘<cite>Plates Illustrative of the
Heavens</cite>,’ being an astronomical and geographical work, much
of whose contents were obtained from Europeans residing in
the country. But even if the Chinese had better treatises on
these subjects, the information contained in them would be
of little use until it was taught in their schools. The high officers
in the government begin now to see the importance of a
better acquaintance with general geography. Commissioner
Lin, in 1841, published a partial translation of Murray’s <cite>Cyclopædia
of Geography</cite>, in 20 volumes; Gov. Seu Ki-yu, in 1850,
issued a compend of geographical notices with maps, and many
others, more accurate and extensive, are now extant.</p>

<p>However scarce their geographical works upon foreign countries
may be, those delineating the topography of their own are
hardly equalled in number and minuteness in any language:
every district and town of importance in the empire, as well as
every department and province, has a local geography of its
own. It may be said that the topographical and statistical
works form, after the ethical, the most valuable portion of
Chinese literature. It would not be difficult to collect a library
of 10,000 volumes of such treatises alone; the topography of the
city of Suchau, and of the province of Chehkiang, are each in
40 vols., while the <cite>Kwangtung Tung Chí</cite>, an ‘Historical and
Statistical Account of Kwangtung,’ is in 182 volumes. None
of these works, however, would bear to be translated entire,
such is the amount of legendary and unimportant matter contained
in them; but they contain many data not to be overlooked
by one who undertakes to write a geography of China.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLIMATE OF THE PROVINCES.</div>

<p>The <i>Climate</i> of the Eighteen Provinces has been represented
in meteorological tables sufficiently well to ascertain its general
salubrity. Pestilences do not frequently visit the land, nor, as
in Southern India, is it deluged with rain during one monsoon,
and parched with drought during the other. The average temperature
of the whole empire is lower than that of any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
country on the same latitude, and the coast is subject to the
same extremes as that of the Atlantic States in America. The
isothermal line of 70° F. as the average for the year, which
passes south of Canton, runs by Cairo and New Orleans, eight
degrees north of it; the line of 60° F. average passes from
Shanghai to Marseilles, Raleigh, St. Louis, and north of San
Francisco; and the line of 50° F. average goes near Peking,
thence on to Vienna, Dublin, Philadelphia, and Puget’s Sound,
in lat. 52°. These various lines show that while Shanghai and
Peking have temperatures similar to Raleigh and Philadelphia,
nearly on their own parallels, Canton is the coldest place on the
globe in its latitude, and the only place within the tropics
where snow falls near the sea-shore. One result of this projection
of the temperate zone into the tropical is seen in the
greater vigor and size of the people of the three southern provinces
over any races on the same parallel elsewhere; and the
productions are not so strictly tropical. The isothermal lines
for the year, as given above, are not so irregular as those for
winter. The line of 60° F. runs by the south of Formosa and
Hongkong, to Cairo and St. Augustine, a range of nine degrees;
but the winter line of 40° F. passes from Shanghai to Constantinople,
Milan, Dublin, and Raleigh, ending at Puget’s
Sound, a range of twenty degrees. A third line of 32° for
winter passes through Shantung to N. Tibet and the Black
Sea, Norway, New York, and Sitka&mdash;a range of twenty-five
degrees.</p>

<p>Peking (lat. 39° 55′ N.) exhibits a fair average of the climate
in that part of the Plain. The extremes range from 104° to
zero F., but the mean annual temperature is 52.3° F., or more
than 9° lower than Naples; the mean winter range is 12° below
freezing, or about 18° lower than that of Paris (lat. 48° 50′),
and 15° lower than Copenhagen. The rainfall seldom reaches
sixteen inches in a year, most of it coming in July and August;
the little snow that descends remains only two or three days on
the ground, and is blown away rather than melted; no one associates
white with winter, but snow is earnestly prayed for as
a purifier of the air against diphtheria and fevers. The winds
from the Plateau cause the barometer and thermometer to fall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
but the sky is clear. In the spring, as the heat increases, the
winds raise the dust and sand over the country; some of these
sand-storms extend even to Shanghai, carrying millions of tons
of soil from its original place. The dryness of the region has
apparently increased during the last century, and constant
droughts destroy the trees, which by their absence increase
the desiccation now going on. Frost closes the rivers for three
months, and ice is cheap. After the second crops fully start in
August, the autumns become mild, and till the 10th of December
are calm and genial.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The climate of the Plain is generally good, but near the
rivers and marshy grounds along the Grand Canal, agues and
bowel complaints prevail. A resident speaks of the temperature
of Nanking and the region around it: “This vast Plain
being only a marsh half drained, the moisture is excessive,
giving rise to many strange diseases, all of them serious, and
not unfrequently mortal. The climate affects the natives from
other provinces, and Europeans. I have not known one of the
latter who was not sick for six months or a year after his arrival.
Every one who comes here must prepare himself for a
tertian or quotidian. For myself, after suffering two months
from a malignant fever, I had ten attacks of a malady the Chinese
here call the <i>sand</i>, from the skin being covered with little
blackish pimples, resembling grains of dust. It is prompt and
violent in its progress, and corrupts the blood so rapidly that in
a few minutes it stagnates and coagulates in the veins. The
best remedy the people have is to cicatrize the least fleshy parts
of the body with a copper cash. The first attack I experienced
rendered all my limbs insensible in two minutes, and I expected
to die before I could receive extreme unction. After recovering
a little, great lassitude succeeded.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The monsoons
form an important element in the seaside climate as far north
as latitude 31°. The dry and wet seasons correspond to the
north-east and south-west monsoons, assuaging the heats of
summer by their cooling showers, and making the winters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
bracing and healthy. Above the Formosa Channel they are
less regular in the summer than in winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLIMATE OF THE COAST TOWNS.</div>

<p>The inhabitants of Shanghai suffer from rapid changes in
the autumn and spring months, and pulmonary and rheumatic
complaints are common. The maximum of heat is 100° F.,
and the minimum 24°, but ice is not common, nor does snow
remain long on the ground. The average temperature of the
summer is from 80° to 93° by day, and from 60° to 75° by
night; the thermometer in winter ranges from 45° to 60° by
day, and from 36° to 45° by night.</p>

<p>Owing in some degree to the hills, the extremes are rather
greater at Ningpo than Shanghai. The thermometer ranges
from 24° to 107° during the twelvemonth, and changes of 20°
in the course of two hours are not unusual, rendering it the
most unhealthy station along the coast. There is a hot and
cold season of three months each at this place. The cold is
very piercing when the north-east winds set in, and fires are
needed, but natives content themselves with additional clothing.
The large brick beds (<i>kang</i>) common in Chihlí are not often
seen. Ice forms in pools, and is gathered to preserve fish.
Snow frequently falls, but does not remain long. Occasionally
it covers the hills in Chehkiang for several weeks to the depth
of six inches. Fuhchau and Canton lie at the base of hills,
within a hundred miles of the sea-coast, and their climates exhibit
greater extremes than Amoy and Hongkong. Frost and
ice are common every winter at each of the former, and fires
are therefore pleasant in the house. The extremes at Fuhchau
are from 38° to 95°, with an average of 56° during December
and 82° for August. Along this whole coast the most refreshing
monsoon makes the summers very agreeable. The climate of
Amoy is delightful, but its insular position renders a residence
somewhat less agreeable than on the main. Here the thermometer
ranges from 40° to 96° during the year, without the
rapid changes of Ningpo. The heat continues longer, though
assuaged by breezes from the sea.</p>

<p>Meteorology at Canton and its vicinity has been carefully
studied; on the whole, its climate, and especially that of Macao,
may be considered more salubrious than in most other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
places situated between the tropics. The thermometer at
Canton in July and August stands on an average at 80° to 88°,
and in January and February at 50° to 60°. The highest recorded
observation in 1831 was 94°, in July; and the lowest,
29° in January. Ice sometimes forms in shallow vessels a line
or two in thickness, but no use is made of it. A fall of snow
nearly two inches deep occurred there in February, 1835,
which remained on the ground three hours. Having never
seen any before, the citizens hardly knew what was its proper
name, some calling it <i>falling cotton</i>, and every one endeavoring
to preserve a little for a febrifuge. Another similar fall occurred
in the winter of 1861. Fogs are common during February
and March, and the heat sometimes renders them very
disagreeable, it being necessary to keep up a little fire to dry
the house. Most of the rain falls in May and June, but there
is nothing like the rainy season at Calcutta and Manilla in July,
August, and September. The regular monsoon comes from
the south-west, with frequent showers to allay the heat. In
the succeeding months, northerly winds commence, but from
October to January the temperature is agreeable, the sky clear,
and the air invigorating. Few large cities are more healthy
than Canton; no epidemics nor malaria prevail, notwithstanding
the fact that much of the town is built upon piles.</p>

<p>The climate of Macao and Hongkong has not so great a range
as Canton, from their proximity to the sea. Few cities in Asia
are more salutiferous than Macao, though it has been remarked
that few of the natives there attain a great age. The maximum
is 90°, with an average summer heat of 84°. The minimum is
50°, and average winter weather 68°, with almost uninterrupted
sunshine. Fogs are not often seen here, but on the river they
prevail, being frequent at Whampoa. North-easterly gales
are common in the spring and autumn, and have a noticeable
periodicity of three days. The vegetation does not change its
general aspect during the winter, the trees cease to grow, and the
grass becomes brownish; but the stimulus of the warm moisture
in March soon makes a sensible difference in the appearance of
the landscape, and bright green leaves rapidly replace the old.
The reputed insalubrity of Hongkong, in early days, was owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to other causes than climate, and when it became a well-built and
well-drained town, its unwholesomeness disappeared. The rain-fall
is greater than in Macao, owing to the attraction of the high
peaks. During the rainy weather the walls of houses become
damp, and if newly plastered, drip with moisture.</p>

<p>The Chinese consider the provinces of Kwangtung, Kwangsí,
and Yunnan to be the most unhealthy of the eighteen, and for
this reason employ them as places of banishment for criminals
from the north-eastern districts. The central portions of the
country are on some accounts the most bracing, not so liable to
sudden changes as the coast, nor so cold as the western and
northern districts. Sz’chuen and Kweichau are cooler than
Fuhkien and Chehkiang, owing to the mountains in and upon
their borders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RAIN-FALL ON CHINESE AND AMERICAN COASTS.</div>

<p>The marked contrast between the Chinese and American
coasts in regard to rain is doubtless owing, in a great degree, to
the outlying islands from Formosa to Sagalien on the former,
whose high mountains arrest the clouds in their progress inland.
The <i>Kuro-siwo</i>, being outside of them, allows a far greater
mass of cold water between it and the shore on the Chinese,
than is the case on the Atlantic coast, and renders it the colder
of the two by nearly eight degrees of latitude, if isothermal
lines alone are regarded. This mass of cold water, having less
evaporation, deprives the maritime provinces of rain in diminishing
supply as one goes north along the skirts of the Plain,
until the Chang-peh shan are reached. The rains which fall in
the western provinces and the slopes of the Bayan kara Mountains,
coming up from the Indian Ocean during the south-west
monsoon, fall in decreasing quantities as the clouds are driven
north-east across the basins of the Yangtsz’ and Yellow rivers.
In the western part of Kansuh the humidity covers the mountains
with more vegetation than further east, toward the ocean.
Snow falls as late as June, and frosts occur in every month of the
year. The enormous elevation of the western side of China near
Tibet, the absence of an expanse of water like the great lakes,
and the bareness of the mountains north of the Mei ling, account
for much of this difference between the United States and China;
but more extended data are needed for accurate deductions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The fall of rain at Canton is 70 inches annually, which is the
mean of sixteen years’ observation. Ninety inches was registered
during one of these years. Nearly one-half of the whole
falls during May, June, and September. The average at
Shanghai for four years was 36 inches. No observations are
recorded for the valley of the Yangtsz’. Near the edge of the
Plateau the rainfall averages 16 inches in the province of
Chihlí, and rather more in Shansí and Shantung, where
moisture is attracted by the mountains. More than three-fourths
of the rain falls during the ten weeks ending August
31st. Snow seldom remains on the level over a fortnight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYFOONS.</div>

<p>The increased temperature on the southern coast during the
months of June and July operates, with other causes, to produce
violent storms along the seaboard, called <i>tyfoons</i>, a word derived
from the Chinese <i>ta-fung</i>, or ‘great wind.’ These destructive
tornadoes occur from Hainan to Chusan, between July and
October, gradually progressing northward as the season advances,
and diminishing in fury in the higher latitudes. They
annually occasion great losses to the native and foreign shipping
in Chinese waters, more than half the sailing ships lost on that
coast having suffered in them. Happily, their fury is oftenest
spent at sea, but when they occur inland, the loss of life is fearful.
In August, 1862, and September 21, 1874, the deaths
reported in two such storms near Canton, Hongkong, and their
vicinity, were upward of 30,000 each. In the latter instance
the American steamer Alaska, of 3,500 tons, was lifted from
her anchorage and quietly put down in five feet of water near
the shore, from whence she was safely floated some months
afterward.</p>

<p>Tyfoons exhaust their force within a narrow track, which, in
such cases as have been registered, lies in no uniform direction,
other than from south to north, at a greater or less angle, along
the coast. The principal phenomena indicating their approach
are the direction of the wind, which commences to blow in soft
zephyrs from the north, without, however, assuaging the heat
or disturbing the stifling calm, and the falling barometer. The
glass usually begins to fall several hours before the storm commences,
and the rarefaction of the air is further shown by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
heavy swell rolling in upon the beach, though the sea remains
unruffled. The wind increases as it veers to the north-east, and
from that point to south-east blows with the greatest force in
fitful gusts. The rain falls heaviest toward the close of the
gale, when the glass begins to rise. The barometer not unfrequently
falls below 28 <i>in.</i> Capt. Krusenstern in 1804 records
his surprise at seeing the mercury sink out of sight.</p>

<p>The Chinese have erected temples in Hainan to the Tyfoon
Mother, a goddess whom they supplicate for protection against
these hurricanes. They say “that a few days before a tyfoon
comes on, a slight noise is heard at intervals, whirling round
and then stopping, sometimes impetuous and sometimes slow.
This is a ‘tyfoon brewing.’ Then fiery clouds collect in thick
masses; the thunder sounds deep and heavy. Rainbows appear,
now forming an unbroken curve and again separating, and the
ends of the bow dip into the sea. The sea sends back a bellowing
sound, and boils with angry surges; the loose rocks dash
against each other, and detached sea-weed covers the water;
there is a thick, murky atmosphere; the water-fowl fly about
affrighted; the trees and leaves bend to the south&mdash;the tyfoon
has commenced. When to it is superadded a violent rain and
a frightful surf, the force of the tempest is let loose, and away
fly the houses up to the hills, and the ships and boats are
removed to the dry land; horses and cattle are turned heels
over head, trees are torn up by the roots, and the sea boils up
twenty or thirty feet, inundating the fields and destroying vegetation.
This is called <i>tieh kü</i>, or an <i>iron whirlwind</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Those
remarkable gusts which annually occur in the Atlantic States,
called <i>tornadoes</i>, defined as local storms affecting a thread of
surface a few miles long, are unknown in China. The healthy
climate of China has had much to do with the civilization of its
inhabitants. No similar area in the world exceeds it for general
salubrity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FU, TING, CHAU, AND HIEN.</div>

<p>The Chinese are the only people who have, by means of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
term added to the name of a place, endeavored to designate its
relative rank. Three of the words used for this purpose, viz.,
<i>fu</i>, <i>chau</i>, and <i>hien</i>, have been translated as ‘first,’ ‘second,’ and
‘third’ rank; but this gradation is not quite correct, for the terms
do not apply to the city or town alone, but to the portions of
country of which it is the capital. The nature of these and
other terms, and the divisions intended by them, are thus
explained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Eighteen Provinces are divided into <i>fu</i>, <i>ting</i>, <i>chau</i>, and <i>hien</i>. A <i>fu</i>
is a large portion or department of a province, under the general control of
one civil officer immediately subordinate to the heads of the provincial government.
A <i>ting</i> is a division of a province smaller than a <i>fu</i>, and either like it
governed by an officer immediately subject to the heads of the provincial
government, or else forming a subordinate part of a <i>fu</i>. In the former case it
is called <i>chih-lí</i>, <i>i.e.</i> under the ‘direct rule’ of the provincial government;
in the latter case it is simply called <i>ting</i>. A <i>chau</i> is a division similar to a
<i>ting</i>, and like it either independent of any other division, or forming part of
a <i>fu</i>. The difference between the two consists in the government of a <i>ting</i>
resembling that of a <i>fu</i> more nearly than that of a <i>chau</i> does: that of the
<i>chau</i> is less expensive. The <i>ting</i> and <i>chau</i> of the class to which the term
<i>chih-lí</i> is attached, may be denominated in common with the <i>fu</i>, <i>departments</i>
or <i>prefectures</i>; and the term <i>chih-lí</i> may be rendered by the word <i>independent</i>.
The subordinate <i>ting</i> and <i>chau</i> may both be called <i>districts</i>. A <i>hien</i>, which
is also a <i>district</i>, is a small division or subordinate part of a department,
whether of a <i>fu</i>, or of an independent <i>chau</i> or <i>ting</i>.</p>

<p>“Each <i>fu</i>, <i>ting</i>, <i>chau</i>, and <i>hien</i>, possesses at least one walled town, the seat
of its government, which bears the same name as the department or district to
which it pertains. Thus Hiangshan is the chief town of the district Hiangshan
hien; and Shauking, that of the department Shauking fu. By European
writers, the chief towns of the <i>fu</i> or departments have been called cities
of the first order; those of the <i>chau</i>, cities of the second order; and those of
the <i>hien</i>, cities of the third order. The division called <i>ting</i>, being rarely met
with, has been left out of the arrangement&mdash;an arrangement not recognized in
China. It must be observed that the chief town of a <i>fu</i> is always also the
chief town of a <i>hien</i> district; and sometimes, when of considerable size and
importance, it and the country around are divided into two <i>hien</i> districts, both
of which have the seat of their government within the same walls: but this
is not the case with the <i>ting</i> and <i>chau</i> departments. A district is not always
subdivided; instances may occur of a whole district possessing but one important
town. But as there are often large and even walled towns not included
in the number of chief or of district towns, consequently not the seat of a
regular <i>chau</i> or <i>hien</i> magistracy, a subdivision of a district is therefore frequently
rendered necessary; and for the better government of such towns
and the towns surrounding them, magistrates are appointed to them, secondary
to the magistrates of the departments or the districts in which they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
comprised. Thus Fuhshan is a very large commercial town or mart called a
<i>chin</i>, situated in the district of Nanhai, of the department of Kwangchau,
about twelve miles distant from Canton. The chief officer of the department
has therefore an assistant residing there, and the town is partly under his
government and partly under that of the Nanhai magistrate, within whose
district it is included, but who resides at Canton. There are several of these
<i>chin</i> in the provinces, as Kingteh in Kiangsí, Siangtan in Hunan, etc.; they
are not inclosed by walls. Macao affords another instance: being a place of
some importance, both from its size and as the residence of foreigners, an assistant
to the Hiangshan hien magistrate is placed over it, and it is also under
the control of an assistant to the chief magistrate of the <i>fu</i>. Of these assistant
magistrates, there are two ranks secondary to the chief magistrate of a <i>fu</i>,
two secondary to the magistrate of a <i>chau</i>, and two also secondary to the magistrate
of a <i>hien</i>. The places under the rule of these assistant magistrates are
called by various names, most frequently <i>chin</i> and <i>so</i>, and sometimes also <i>chai</i>
and <i>wei</i>. These names do not appear to have reference to any particular form
of municipal government existing in them; but the <i>chai</i> and the <i>wei</i> are often
military posts; and sometimes a place is, with respect to its civil government,
the chief city of a <i>fu</i>, while with respect to its military position it is called
<i>wei</i>. There are other towns of still smaller importance; these are under the
government of inferior magistrates who are called <i>siun kien</i>: a division of
country under such a magistrate is called a <i>sz’</i>, which is best represented by
the term township or <i>commune</i>. The town of Whampoa and country around
it form one such division, called Kiautang sz’, belonging to the district of
Pwanyu, in the department of Kwangchau.</p>

<p>“In the mountainous districts of Kwangsí, Yunnan, Kweichau, and Sz’chuen,
and in some other places, there are districts called <i>tu sz’</i>. Among
these, the same distinctions of <i>fu</i>, <i>chau</i>, and <i>hien</i> exist, together with the
minor division <i>sz’</i>. The magistrates of these departments and districts are
hereditary in their succession, being the only hereditary local officers acknowledged
by the supreme government.</p>

<p>“There is a larger division than any of the above, but as it does not prevail
universally, it was not mentioned in the first instance. It is called <i>tau</i>, a
<i>course</i> or <i>circuit</i>, and comprises two or more departments of a province,
whether <i>fu</i>, or independent <i>ting</i> or <i>chau</i>. These circuits are subject to the
government of officers called <i>tau-tai</i> or intendants of circuit, who often combine
with political and judicial powers a military authority and various duties
relating to the territory or to the revenue.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p></div>

<p>The eighteen provinces received their present boundaries
and divisions in the reign of Kienlung; and the little advance
which has been made abroad in the geography of China is
shown by the fact, that although these divisions were established
a hundred years ago, the old demarkations, existing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the time of the survey in 1710, are still found in many modern
European geographies and maps. The following table shows
their present divisions and government. The three columns
under the head of <i>Departments</i> contain the <i>fu</i>, <i>chihlí ting</i>, and
<i>chihlí chau</i>, all of which are properly prefectures; the three columns
under the head of <i>Districts</i> contain the <i>ting</i>, <i>chau</i>, and <i>hien</i>.</p>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Chihlí</span> is the most important of the whole.
On foreign maps it is sometimes written Pechele (<i>i.e.</i>, North
Chihlí), a name formerly given it in order to distinguish it
from Kiangnan, or <i>Nan-chihlí</i>, in which the seat of government
was once located. This name is descriptive, rather than
technical, and means ‘Direct rule,’ denoting that from this province
the supreme power which governs the empire proceeds;
any province, in which the Emperor and court should be fixed,
would therefore be termed <i>Chihlí</i>, and its chief city <i>King</i>,
‘capital,’ or <i>King-tu</i> or <i>King-sz’</i>, ‘court of the capital.’ The
surface of this province lying south of the Great Wall is level,
excepting a few ridges of hills in the west and north, while
the eastern parts, and those south to the Gulf, are among the
flattest portions of the Great Plain.</p>

<p>It is bounded on the north-east by Liautung, where for a
short distance the Great Wall is the frontier line; on the east
by the Gulf of Pechele; on the south-east and south by Shantung;
on the south-west by Honan; on the west by Shansí;
and north by Inner Mongolia, where the river Liau forms the
boundary. The extensive region beyond the Wall, occupied
mostly by the Tsakhar Mongols, is now included within the
jurisdiction, and placed under the administration of officers residing
at one of the garrisoned gates of the Great Wall; the
area of this part is about half that of the whole province. The
chief department in the province, that of Shuntien, being both
large and important, as containing the metropolis, is divided into
four <i>lu</i> or circuits, each under the rule of a sub-prefect, who is
subordinate to the prefect living at Peking.</p>

<p>Peking<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> (<i>i.e.</i>, Northern Capital) is situated upon a sandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
plain, about twelve miles south-west of the Pei ho, and more
than a hundred miles west-north-west of its mouth, in lat. 39°
54′ 36″ N., and long. 116° 27′ E., or nearly on the parallel of
Samarkand, Naples, and Philadelphia. It is a city worthy of
note on many accounts. Its ancient history as the capital of
the <i>Yen Kwoh</i> (the ‘Land of Swallows’) during the feudal
times, and its later position as the metropolis of the empire for
many centuries, give it historical importance; while its imperial
buildings, its broad avenues with their imposing gates and
towers, its regular arrangement, extent, populousness, and diversity
of costume and equipage, combine to render it to a
traveller the most interesting and unique city in Asia. It is
now ruinous and poor, but the remains of its former grandeur
under Kienlung’s prosperous reign indicate the justness of the
comparisons made by the Catholic writers with western cities
one hundred and eighty years ago. The entire circuit of the
walls and suburbs is reckoned by Hyacinthe at twenty-five
miles, and its area at twenty-seven square miles, but more accurate
measurements of the walls alone give forty-one <i>li</i>, or
14.25 miles (or 23.55 kilometres) for the Manchu city, including
the cross-wall, and twenty-eight <i>li</i>, or ten miles, for the
Chinese city on its south; not counting the cross-wall, the circuit
measures almost twenty-one miles. The suburbs near the
thirteen outer gates altogether form a small proportion to the
whole; the area within them is nearly twenty-six square miles.
Those residents who have had the best opportunities estimate
the entire population at a million or somewhat less; no census
returns are available to prove this figure, nor can it be stated
what is the proportion of Manchus, Mongols, and Chinese, except
that the latter outnumber all others. Du Halde reckoned it
to be about three millions, and Klaproth one million three hundred
thousand; and each was probably true at some period,
for the number has diminished with the poverty of the Government.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE AN-TING GATE, WALL OF PEKING.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">POSITION AND HISTORY OF PEKING.</div>

<p>Peking is regarded by the Chinese as one of their ancient
cities, but it was not made the capital of the whole empire
until Kublai established his court at this spot in 1264. The
Ming emperors who succeeded the Mongols held their court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
at Nanking until Yungloh transferred the seat of government
to Peking in 1411, where it has since remained. Under the
Mongols, the city was called <i>Khan-baligh</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, city of the
Khan), changed into Cambalu in the accounts of those times;
on Chinese maps it is usually called <i>King-sz’</i>.</p>

<p>Peking has, during its history, existed under many different
names; after each disaster her walls have been changed
and her houses rebuilt, so that to-day she stands, like the
capitals of the ancient Roman and Byzantine empires, upon
the débris of centuries of buildings. The most important
renovations have been those by the Liao dynasty, in 937
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, who entirely rebuilt the city, and by the Kin rulers
in 1151.</p>

<p>It was at first surrounded by a single wall pierced by nine
gates, whence it is sometimes called the City of Nine Gates.
The southern suburbs were inclosed by Kiatsing in 1543, and
the city now consists of two portions, the northern or inner
city (<i>Nui ching</i>), containing about fifteen square miles, where
are the palace, government buildings, and barracks for troops;
and the southern or Outer city (<i>Wai ching</i>), where the Chinese
live. The wall of the Manchu city averages fifty feet high,
forty wide at top, and about sixty at bottom, most of the slope
being on the inner face. That around the Outer city is no
more than thirty in height, twenty-five thick at bottom, and
about fifteen at top. The terre-plein throughout is paved with
bricks weighing sixty pounds each; a crenellated parapet runs
around the entire town, intended only for archers or musketeers,
as no port-holes for cannon exist. It is undoubtedly the
finest wall surrounding any city now extant. Near the gates,
of which there are sixteen in all, the walls are faced with stone,
but in other places with these large bricks, laid in a concrete of
lime and clay, which in process of time becomes almost as durable
as stone. The intermediate space between facings is filled
up with the earth taken from the ditch which surrounds the
city. Square buttresses occur at intervals of sixty yards on
the outer face, each projecting fifty feet, and every sixth one
being twice the size of the others; their tops furnish room for
the troops posted there to resist side attacks. Each gate is sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>mounted
with a brick tower of many stories, over a hundred
feet high, built in galleries with port-holes, and giving a very
imposing appearance to the city as one approaches it from the
wide plain. The gates of the Manchu city have a double entrance
formed by joining their supporting bastions with a circular
wall in which are side entrances, thus making an enceinte
of several acres, in which the yellow-tiled temple to the tutelary
God of War is conspicuous. The arches of all the gates
are built solidly of granite; the massive doors are closed and
barred every night soon after dark.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENERAL ASPECT OF THE CAPITAL.</div>

<p>At the sides of the gates, and also between them, are esplanades
for mounting to the top; this is shut to the common
people, and the guards are not allowed to bring their women
upon the wall, which would be deemed an affront to Kwantí.
The moat around the city is fed from the Tunghwui River,
which also supplies all the other canals leading across or
through the city. The approach to Peking from Tung chau is
by an elevated stone road, but nothing of the buildings inside
the walls is seen; and were it not for the lofty towers over the
gates, it would more resemble an encampment inclosed by a
massive wall than a large metropolis. No spires or towers of
churches, no pillars or monuments, no domes or minarets, nor
even many dwellings of superior elevation, break the dull uniformity
of this or any Chinese city. In Peking, the different
colored yellow or green tiles on official buildings,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> mixed with
the brown roofs of common houses, impart a variety to the
scene, but the chief objects to relieve the monotony are the
large clumps of trees, and the flag-staffs in pairs near the temples.
The view from the walls impresses one with the grand
ideas of the founders of the city; and the palaces in the Forbidden
City, towering above everything else, worthily exhibit
their notions of what was befitting the sovereigns of the Middle
Kingdom. The Bell and Clock Towers, the Prospect Hill, the
dagobas, pagodas, and gate towers, and lastly the Temple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Heaven, are all likewise visible from this point, and render the
scene picturesque and peculiar.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The plan of the city here given is reduced from a large Chinese
map, but is not very exact. The northern portion occupies
for the most part the same area as the Cambaluc of Marco
Polo, which, however, extended about two miles north, where
the remains of the old north wall of the Mongols still exist.
On their expulsion Hungwu erected the present northern wall,
and his son Yungloh rebuilt the other three sides in 1419 on a
rather larger scale; but the arrangement of the streets and
gates is due to the Great Khan. When taken possession of by
the Manchus in 1644, they found a magnificent city ready for
them, uninjured and strong, which they apportioned among
their officers and bannermen; but necessity soon obliged these
men, less frugal and thrifty than the natives, to sell them, and
content themselves with humbler abodes; consequently, the
greater part of the northern city is now tenanted by Chinese.
The innermost inclosure in the <i>Nui Ching</i> contains the palace
and its surrounding buildings; the second is occupied by barracks
and public offices, and by many private residences; the
outer one, for the most part, consists of dwelling-houses, with
shops in the large avenues. The inner inclosure measures 6.3
<i>li</i>, or 2.23 miles, in circuit, and is called <i>Tsz’ Kin Ching</i>, or
‘Carnation Prohibited City;’ the wall is less solid and high
than the city wall; it is covered with bright yellow tiles,
guarded by numerous stations of bannermen and gendarmerie,
and surrounded by a deep, wide moat. Two gates, the <i>Tung-hwa</i>
and <i>Sí-hwa</i>, on the east and west, afford access to the interior
of this habitation of the Emperor, as well as the space
and rooms appertaining, which furnish lodgment to the guard
defending the approach to the Dragon’s Throne; a tower at
each corner, and one over each gateway, also give accommodation
to other troops. The interior of this inclosure is divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
into three parts by two walls running from south to north, and
the whole is occupied by a suite of court-yards and halls, which,
in their arrangement and architecture, far exceed any other
specimens of the kind in China. According to the notions of a
common Chinese, all here is gold and silver; “he will tell you
of gold and silver pillars, gold and silver roofs, and gold and
silver vases, in which swim gold and silver fishes.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">PALACES OF THE PROHIBITED CITY.</div>

<p>The southern gate, called the <i>Wu Măn</i>, or ‘Meridian Gate,’
is the fourth in going north from the entrance opposite the
<i>Tsien Măn</i>, and this distance of nearly half a mile is occupied
by troops. The <i>Wu Măn</i> leads into the middle division, in
which are the imperial buildings; it is especially appropriated
to the Emperor, and whenever he passes through it, a bell
placed in the tower above is struck; when his troops return in
triumph, a drum is beaten, and the prisoners are here presented
to him; here, too, the presents he confers on vassals and ambassadors
are pompously bestowed. Passing through this gate
into a large court, over a small creek spanned by five marble
bridges, ornamented with sculptures, the visitor is led through
the <i>Tai-ho Măn</i> into a second court paved with marble, and
terminated on the sides by gates, porticos, and pillared corridors.
The next building, at the head of this court, called the
<i>Tai-ho tien</i>, or ‘Hall of Highest Peace,’ is a superb marble
structure, one hundred and ten feet high, standing on a terrace
that raises it twenty feet above the ground; five flights of
stairs, decorated with balustrades and sculptures, lead up to it,
and five doors open through it into the next court-yard. It is
a great hall of seventy-two pillars, measuring about two hundred
feet by ninety broad, with a throne in the midst. Here
the Emperor holds his levees on New Year’s Day, his birthdays,
and other state occasions; a cortége of about fifty household
courtiers stand near him, while those of noble and inferior
dignity and rank stand in the court below in regular grades,
and, when called upon, fall prostrate as they all make the fixed
obeisances. It was in this hall that Titsingh and Van Braam
were banqueted by Kienlung, January 20, 1795, of which interesting
ceremony the Dutch embassador gives an account, and
since which event no European has entered the building. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
three <i>Tien</i> in this inclosure are the audience halls, and the side
buildings contain stores and treasures under the charge of the
Household Board, with minor bureaus.</p>

<p>Beyond it are two halls; the first, the <i>Chung-ho tien</i>, or
‘Hall of Central Peace,’ having a circular roof, that rests on
columns arranged nearly four-square. Here the Emperor
comes to examine the written prayers provided to be offered at
the state worship. The second is the <i>Pao-ho tien</i>, or ‘Hall of
Secure Peace,’ elevated on a high marble terrace, and containing
nine rows of pillars. The highest degrees for literary
merit are here conferred triennially by the Emperor upon one
hundred and fifty or more scholars; here, also, he banquets his
foreign guests and other distinguished persons the day before
New Year’s Day. After ascending a stairway, and passing the
<i>Kien Tsing Măn</i>, the visitor reaches the <i>Kien Tsing Kung</i>,
or ‘Palace of Heavenly Purity,’ into which no one can enter
without special license. In it is the council-chamber, where
the Emperor usually sits at morning audience up to eight
o’clock, to transact business with his ministers, and see those
appointed to office. The building is the most important as it
is described to be the loftiest and most magnificent of all the
palaces. In the court before it is a small tower of gilt copper,
adorned with a great number of figures, and on each side are
large incense vases, the uses of which are no doubt religious.
It was in this palace that Kanghí celebrated a singular and
unique festival, in 1722, for all the men in the empire over
sixty years of age, that being the sixtieth year of his reign.
His grandson Kienlung, in 1785, in the fiftieth year of his
reign, repeated the ceremony, on which occasion the number
of guests was about three thousand.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Beyond it stands the
‘Palace of Earth’s Repose,’ where ‘Heaven’s consort’ rules
her miniature court in the imperial harem; there are numerous
buildings of lesser size in this part of the inclosure, and
adjoining the northern wall of the Forbidden City is the imperial
Flower Garden, designed for the use of its inmates. The
gardens are adorned with elegant pavilions, temples, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
groves, and interspersed with canals, fountains, pools, and
flower-beds. Two groves rising from the bosoms of small
lakes, and another crowning the summit of an artificial mountain,
add to the beauty of the scene, and afford the inmates of
the palace an agreeable variety.</p>

<p>In the eastern division of the Prohibited City are the offices
of the Cabinet, where its members hold their sessions, and the
treasury of the palace. North of it lies the ‘Hall of Intense
Thought,’ where sacrifices are presented to Confucius and other
sages. Not far from this hall stands the <i>Wăn-yuen koh</i>, or
the Library, the catalogue of whose contents is published from
time to time, forming an admirable synopsis of Chinese literature.
At the northern end of the eastern division are numerous
palaces and buildings occupied by princes of the blood, and
those connected with them; and in this quarter is placed the
<i>Fung Sien tien</i>, a small temple where the Emperor comes to
‘bless his ancestors.’ Here the Emperor and his family perform
their devotions before the tablets of their departed progenitors;
whenever he leaves or returns to his palace, the first
day of a season, and on other occasions, the monarch goes
through his devotions in this hall.</p>

<p>The western division contains a great variety of edifices devoted
to public and private purposes, among which may be
mentioned the hall of distinguished sovereigns, statesmen, and
literati, the printing-office, the Court of Controllers for the
regulation of the receipts and disbursements of the court, and
the <i>Ching-hwang Miao</i>, or ‘Guardian Temple’ of the city.
The number of people residing within the Prohibited City
cannot be stated, but probably is not large; most of them are
Manchus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IMPERIAL CITY.</div>

<p>The second inclosure, which surrounds the imperial palaces,
is called <i>Hwang Ching</i>, or ‘Imperial City,’ and is an oblong rectangle
about six miles in circuit, encompassed by a wall twenty
feet high, and having a gate in each face. From the southern
gate, called the <i>Tien-an Măn</i>, or ‘Heavenly Rest,’ a broad
avenue leads up to the <i>Kin Ching</i>; and before it, outside of
the wall, is an extensive space walled in, and having one entrance
on the south, called the gate of Great Purity, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
no one is allowed to enter except on foot, unless by special permission.
On the right of the avenue within the wall is a gateway
leading to the <i>Tai Miao</i>, or ‘Great Temple’ of the imperial
ancestors, a large collection of buildings inclosed by a wall 3,000
feet in circuit. It is the most honored of religious structures
next to the Temple of Heaven, and contains tablets to princes
and meritorious officers. Here offerings are presented before
the tablets of deceased emperors and empresses, and worship
performed at the end of the year by the members of the imperial
family and clan to their departed forefathers. Across
the avenue from this temple is a gateway leading to the <i>Shié-Tsih
tan</i>, or altar of the gods of Land and Grain. These were
originally <i>Kau-lung</i>, a Minister of Works, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2500, and <i>Hau-tsih</i>,
a remote ancestor of Chau Kung; here the Emperor sacrifices
in spring and autumn. This altar consists of two stories,
each five feet high, the upper one being fifty-eight feet square;
no other altar of the kind is found in the empire, and it would
be tantamount to high treason to erect one and worship upon it.
The north, east, south, and west altar are respectively black,
green, red, and white, and the top yellow; the ceremonies connected
with the worship held here are among the most ancient
practised among the Chinese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND PARKS.</div>

<p>On the north of the palace, separated by a moat, and surrounded
by a wall more than a mile in circuit, is the <i>King
Shan</i>, or ‘Prospect Hill,’ an artificial mound, nearly one hundred
and fifty feet high, and having five summits, crowned with as
many temples; many of these show the neglect in which public
edifices soon fall. Trees of various kinds border its base, and
line the paths leading to the tops. Its height allows the spectator
to overlook the whole city, while, too, it is itself a conspicuous
object from every direction. The earth and stone in it
were taken from the ditches and pools dug in and around the
city, and near its base are many tanks of picturesque shape and
appearance; so that altogether it forms a great ornament to the
city. Another name for it is <i>Mei Shan</i>, or ‘Coal Hill,’ from a
tradition that a quantity of coal was placed there, as a supply
in case of siege. The western part of this inclosure is chiefly
occupied by the <i>Sí Yuen</i>, or ‘Western Park,’ in and around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
which are found some of the most beautiful objects and spots
in the metropolis. An artificial lake, more than a mile long,
and averaging a furlong in breadth, occupies the centre; it is
supplied from the Western Hills, and its waters are adorned
with the splendid lotus. A marble bridge of nine arches
crosses it, and its banks are shaded by groves of trees, under
which are well-paved walks. On its south-eastern side is a
large summer-house, consisting of several edifices partly in or
over the water, and inclosing a number of gardens and walks,
in and around which are artificial hills of rock-work beautifully
alternating or supporting groves of trees and parterres of flowers.</p>

<p>On the western side is the hall for examining military candidates,
where his majesty in person sees them exhibit their
prowess in equestrian archery. At the north end of the lake is
a bridge leading to an islet, which presents the aspect of a hill
of gentle ascent covered with groves, temples, and summer-houses,
and surmounted with a tower, from which an extensive
view can be enjoyed. On the north of the bridge is a hill on
an island called <i>Kiung-hwa tan</i>, capped by a white dagoba.
Near by is an altar forty feet in circuit, and four feet high,
inclosed by a wall, and a temple dedicated to Yuenfí, the
reputed discoverer of the silk-worm, where the Empress annually
offers sacrifices to her; in the vicinity a plantation of mulberry
trees and a cocoonery are maintained. Near the temple
of ‘Great Happiness,’ not far distant from the preceding, on
the northern borders of the lake, is a gilded copper statue of
<i>Maitreya</i>, or the coming Buddha, sixty feet high, with a hundred
arms; the temple is one of the greatest ornaments of the
Park. Across the lake on its western bank, and entered
through the first gate on the south side of the street, is the
<i>Tsz’-kwang Koh</i>, where foreign ministers are received by the
Emperor; the inclosure is kept with great care, and numerous
halls and temples are seen amidst groves of firs. The object
kept in view in the arrangement of these gardens and grounds
has been to make them an epitome of nature, and then furnish
every part with commodious buildings. But however elegant
the palaces and grounds may have appeared when new, it is to
be feared that his majesty has no higher ideas of cleanliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and order than his subjects, and that the various public and
private edifices and gardens in these two inclosures are despoiled
of half their beauty by dirt and neglect. The number of the
palaces in them both is estimated to be over two hundred,
“each of which,” says Attinet, in vague terms, “is sufficiently
large to accommodate the greatest of European noblemen, with
all his retinue.”</p>

<p>Along the avenue leading south from the Imperial City to
the division wall, are found the principal government offices.
Five of the Six Boards have their bureaus on the east side, the
Board of Punishments with its subordinate departments being
situated with its courts on the west side; immediately south of
this is the Censorate. The office attached to the Board of
Rites, for the preparation of the Calendar, commonly called
the Astronomical Board, stands directly east of this; and the
Medical College has its hall not far off. The <i>Hanlin Yuen</i>, or
National Academy, and the <i>Li-fan Yuen</i>, or Colonial Office, are
also near the south-eastern corner of the Imperial City. Opposite
to the Colonial Office is the <i>Tang Tsz’</i>, where the remote
ancestors of the reigning family are worshipped by his majesty
together with the princes of his family; when they come in
procession to this temple in their state dresses, the Emperor, as
high-priest of the family, performs the highest religious ceremony
before his deified ancestors, viz., three kneelings and nine
knockings. After he has completed his devotions, the attendant
grandees go through the same ceremonies. The temple
itself is pleasantly situated in the midst of a grove of fir and
other trees, and the large inclosure around it is prettily laid out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUDDHIST AND CONFUCIAN TEMPLES.</div>

<p>In the south-eastern part of the city, built partly upon the
wall, is the Observatory, which was placed under the superintendence
of the Romish missionaries by Kanghí, but is now
confided to the care of Chinese astronomers. The instruments
are arranged on a terrace higher than the city wall, and are
beautiful pieces of bronze art, though now antiquated and useless
for practical observations. Nearly opposite to the Observatory
stands the Hall for Literary Examinations, where the candidates
of the province assemble to write their essays. In the
north-eastern corner of the city is the Russian Mission and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Astronomical Office, inclosed in a large compound; near it live
the converts. About half a mile west is the <i>Yung-ho Kung</i>, or
‘Lamasary of Eternal Peace,’ wherein about 1,500 Mongol and
Tibetan priests study the dogmas of Buddhism, or spend their
days in idleness, under the control of a <i>Gegen</i> or living Buddha.
Their course of study comprises instruction in metaphysics, ascetic
duties, astrology, and medicine; their daily ritual is performed
in several courts, and the rehearsal of prayers and chants
by so many men strikes the hearer as very impressive. The rear
building contains a wooden image, 70 feet in height, of Maitreya,
the coming Buddha; the whole establishment exhibits in its
buildings, pictures, images, cells, and internal arrangements for
study, living, and worship, one of the most complete in the empire.
Several smaller lamasaries occur in other parts of the city.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Portal of Confucian Temple, Peking.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Directly west of the <i>Yung-ho Kung</i>, and presenting the
greatest contrast to its life and activity, lies the Confucian
Temple, where embowered in a grove of ancient cypresses
stands the imposing <i>Wăn Miao</i>, or ‘Literary Temple,’ in which
the Example and Teacher of all Ages and ten of his great disciples
are worshipped. The hall is 84 feet in front, and the lofty
roof is supported on wooden pillars over 40 feet high, covering
the single room in which their tablets are placed in separate
niches, he in the high seat of honor. All is simple, quiet, and
cheerless; the scene here presents an impressive instance of
merited honors paid to the moral teachers of the people. Opposite
and across the court are ten granite stones shaped like
drums, which are believed to have been made about the eighth
century B.C., and contain stanzas recording King Süen’s hunting
expeditions. In another court are many stone tablets containing
the lists of <i>Tsin-sz’</i> graduates since the Mongol dynasty,
many thousands of names with places of residence. Contiguous
to this temple is the <i>Pih-yung Kung</i>, or ‘Classic Hall,’
where the Emperor meets the graduates and literati. It is a
beautiful specimen of Chinese architectural taste. Near it are
300 stone tablets on which the authorized texts of the classics
are engraved.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<p>North of the Imperial City lies the extensive <i>yamun</i> of the
<i>Ti-tuh</i>, who has the police and garrison of the city under his
control, and exercises great authority in its civil administration.
The Drum and Bell Towers stand north of the <i>Ti-ngan Măn</i>
in the street leading to the city wall, each of them over a hundred
feet high, and forming conspicuous objects; the drum and
bell are sounded at night watches, and can be heard throughout
the city; a clepsydra is still maintained to mark time&mdash;a good
instance of Chinese conservatism, for clocks are now in general
use, and correct the errors of the clepsydra itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHRINES OF ALL RELIGIONS.</div>

<p>Outside of the south-western angle of the Imperial City
stands the Mohammedan mosque, and a large number of Turks
whose ancestors were brought from Turkestan about a century
ago live in its vicinity; this quarter is consequently the chief
resort of Moslems who come to the capital. South-west of the
mosque, near the cross-wall, stands the <i>Nan Tang</i>, or old Por<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>tuguese
church, and just west of the Forbidden City, inside of
the <i>Hwang Ching</i>, is the <i>Peh Tang</i>, or Cathedral; both are
imposing edifices, and near them are large schools and seminaries
for the education of children and neophytes. There are
religious edifices in the Chinese metropolis appropriated to
many forms of religion, viz., the Greek, Latin, and Protestant
churches, Islamism, Buddhism in its two principal forms, Rationalism,
ancestral worship, state worship, and temples dedicated
to Confucius and other deified mortals, besides a great number
in which the popular idols of the country are adored. One of
the most worthy of notice is the <i>Tí-Wang Miao</i>, lying on the
avenue leading to the west gate, a large collection of halls
wherein all the tablets of former monarchs of China from remote
ages are worshipped. The rule for admission into this
Walhalla is to accept all save the vicious and oppressive, those
who were assassinated and those who lost their kingdoms. This
memorial temple was opened in 1522; the Manchus have even
admitted some of the Tartar rulers of the Kin and Liao dynasties,
raising the total number of tablets to nearly three hundred.
It is an impressive sight, these simple tablets of men who once
ruled the Middle Kingdom, standing here side by side, worshipped
by their successors that their spirits may bless the state.
This selection of the good sovereigns alone recalls to mind the
custom in ancient Jerusalem of allowing wicked princes no place
in the sepulchres of the kings. Distinguished statesmen of all
ages, called by the Chinese <i>kwoh chu</i>, or ‘pillars of state,’ are
associated with their masters in this temple, as not unworthy to
receive equal honors.</p>

<p>A little west of this remarkable temple is the <i>Peh-ta sz’</i>,
or ‘White Pagoda Temple,’ so called from a costly dagoba near
it erected about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1100, renovated by Kublai in the thirteenth
century, and rebuilt in 1819. Its most conspicuous feature is
the great copper umbrella on the top. When finished, the
dagoba was described as covered with jasper, and the projecting
parts of the roof with ornaments of exquisite workmanship
tastefully arranged. Around this edifice, which contains twenty
beads or relics of Buddha, two thousand clay pagodas and five
books of charms, are also one hundred and eight small pillars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
on which lamps are burned. The portion of the city lying south
of the cross-wall is inhabited mostly by Chinese, and contains
hundreds of <i>hwui-kwan</i>, or club-houses, erected by the gentry
of cities and districts in all parts of the empire to accommodate
their citizens resorting to the capital. Its streets are narrow
and the whole aspect of its buildings and markets indicates the
life and industry of the people. Hundreds of inns accommodate
travellers who find no lodging-places in the <i>Nui Ching</i>, and
storehouses, theatres, granaries and markets attract or supply
their customers from all parts. There is more dissipation and
freedom from etiquette here, and the Chinese officials feel freer
from their Manchu colleagues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TEMPLE OF HEAVEN.</div>

<p>Three miles south of the Palace, in the Chinese City, is
situated the <i>Tien Tan</i>, or ‘Altar to Heaven,’ so placed because
it was anciently customary to perform sacrifices to Heaven in
the outskirts of the Emperor’s residence city. The compound
is inclosed by more than three miles of wall, within which is
planted a thick grove of locust (<i>Sophora</i>), pine and fir trees, interspaced
with stretches of grass. Within a second wall,
which surrounds the sacred buildings, rises a copse of splendid
and thickly growing cypress trees, reminding one of the solemn
shade in the vicinity of famous temples in Ancient Greece, or
of those celebrated shrines described in Western Asia. The
great South Altar, the most important of Chinese religious
structures, is a beautiful triple circular terrace of white marble,
whose base is 210, middle stage 150, and top 90 feet in width,
each terrace encompassed by a richly carved balustrade. A
curious symbolism of the number three and its multiples may
be noticed in the measurements of this pile. The uppermost
terrace, whose height above the ground is about eighteen feet,
is paved with marble slabs, forming nine concentric circles&mdash;the
inner of nine stones inclosing a central piece, and around
this each receding layer consisting of a successive multiple of
nine until the square of nine (a favorite number of Chinese
philosophy) is reached in the outermost row. It is upon the
single round stone in the centre of the upper plateau that the
Emperor kneels when worshipping Heaven and his ancestors at
the winter solstice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Four flights of nine steps each lead from this elevation to the
next lower stage, where are placed tablets to the spirits of the
sun, the moon, the stars, and the Year God. On the ground at
the end of the four stairways stand vessels of bronze in which
are placed the bundles of cloth and sundry animals constituting
part of the sacrificial offerings. But of vastly greater importance
than these in the matter of burnt-offering is the great
furnace, nine feet high, faced with green porcelain, and ascended
on three of its sides by porcelain staircases. In this
receptacle, erected some hundred feet to the south-east of the
altar, is consumed a burnt-offering of a bullock&mdash;entire and
without blemish&mdash;at the yearly ceremony. The slaughter-house
of the sacrificial bullock stands east of the North Altar, at the
end of an elaborate winding passage, or cloister of 72 compartments,
each 10 feet in length.</p>

<p>Separated from the Altar to Heaven by a low wall, is a
smaller though more conspicuous construction called <i>Ki-kuh
Tan</i>, or ‘Altar of Prayer for Grain.’ Its proportions and arrangement
are somewhat similar to those of the South Altar,
but upon its upper terrace rises a magnificent triple-roofed, circular
building known to foreigners as the ‘Temple of Heaven.’
This elaborate house of worship, whose surmounting gilded ball
rests 100 feet above the platform, was originally roofed with
blue, yellow and green tiles, but by Kienlung these colors were
changed to blue. When, added to these brilliant hues, we consider
the richly carved and painted eaves, the windows shaded
by venetians of blue-glass rods strung together, and the rare
symmetry of its proportions, it is no exaggeration to call this
temple the most remarkable edifice in the capital&mdash;or indeed
in the empire. The native name is <i>Ki-kien Tien</i>, or ‘Temple
of Prayer for the Year.’ In the interior, the large shrines of
carved wood for the tablets correspond to the movable blue
wooden huts which on days of sacrifice are put up on the
Southern Altar. Here, upon some day following the first of
spring (Feb. 6), the Emperor offers his supplications to Heaven
for a blessing upon the year. In times of drought, prayer for
rain is also made at this altar, the Emperor being obliged to
proceed on foot, as a repentant suppliant, to the ‘Hall of Peni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>tent
Fasting,’ a distance of three miles. A green furnace for
burnt-offerings lies to the south-east of this, as of the North
Altar; while in the open park not far from the two and seventy
cloisters are seven great stones, said to have fallen from heaven
and to secure good luck to the country.</p>

<p>Across the avenue upon which is situated this great inclosure
of the <i>Tien Tan</i>, is the <i>Sien Nung Tan</i>, or ‘Altar dedicated
to Shinnung,’ the supposed inventor of agriculture. These precincts
are about two miles in circumference, and contain four
separate altars: to the gods of the heavens, of the earth, of the
planet Jupiter, and to Shinnung. The worship here is performed
at the vernal equinox, at which time the ceremony of
ploughing a part of the inclosed park is performed by the
Emperor, assisted by various officials and members of the Board
of Rites. The district magistrates and prefect also plough their
plats; but no one touches the imperial portion save the monarch
himself. The first two altars are rectangular; that to the
gods of heaven, on the east, is 50 feet long and 4&frac12; feet high:
four marble tablets on it contain the names of the gods of the
clouds, rain, wind, and thunder. That to the gods of earth is
100 feet long by 60 wide; here the five marble tablets contain
the names of celebrated mountains, seas, and lakes in China.
Sacrifices are offered to these divinities at various times, and,
with the prayers presented, are burned in the furnaces, thus
to come before them in the unseen world; the idea which runs
through them partakes of the nature of homage, not of atonement.</p>

<p>Nearly one-half of the Chinese City is empty of dwellings,
much of the open land being cultivated; a large pond for rearing
gold-fish near the <i>Tien Tan</i> is an attractive place. West
of this city wall is an old and conspicuous dagoba in the <i>Tien-ning
sz’</i>, nearly 200 feet high, and a landmark for the city
gate. This part of Peking was much the best built when the
Liao and Kin dynasties occupied it. West of the main city is
the Temple of the Moon, and on the east side, directly opposite,
stands the Temple to the Sun; the <i>Tí Tan</i>, or ‘Altar to Earth,’
is on the north over against the Altar to Heaven, just described.
At all these the Emperor performs religious rites during the
twelve months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The inclosure of the Altar to Earth is smaller, and everything
connected with the sacrifices is on an inferior scale to
those conducted in the Altar to Heaven. The main altar has
two terraces, each 6 feet high, and respectively 106 feet and
60 feet square; the tablet to Imperial Earth is placed on the
upper with those to the Imperial Ancestors, and all are adored
at the summer solstice. The bullock for sacrifice is afterwards
buried and not burned. Adjoining the terraced altar on the
south is a small tank for water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BELL TEMPLE AND HWANG SZ’.</div>

<p>About two miles from the <i>Tí Tan</i>, in a northerly direction,
passing through one of the ruined gates of the Peking of Marco
Polo’s time on the way, is found the <i>Ta-chung sz’</i>, or ‘Bell
Temple,’ in which is hung the great bell of Peking. It was
cast about 1406, in the reign of Yungloh, and was covered over
in 1578 by a small temple. It is 14 feet high, including the
umbones, 34 feet in circumference at the rim, and 9 inches
thick; the weight is 120,000 lbs. av.; it is struck by a heavy
beam swung on the outside. The Emperor cast five bells in all,
but this one alone was hung. It is covered with myriads of
Chinese characters, both inside and out, consisting of extracts
from the <i>Fah-hwa King</i> and <i>Ling-yen King</i>, two Buddhist
classics. In some respects this may be called the most remarkable
work of art now in China; it is the largest suspended
bell in the world. A square hole in the top prevents its fracture
under the heaviest ringing.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A short distance outside the northern gate, <i>Tah-shing Măn</i>,
is an open ground for military reviews, and near it a Buddhist
temple of some note, called <i>Hwang sz’</i>, containing in its enceinte
a remarkable monument erected by Kienlung. In 1779 the
Teshu Lama started for Peking with an escort of 1,500 men;
he was met by the Emperor near the city of Sí-ning in Kansuh,
conducted to Peking with great honor, and lodged in this temple
for several months. He died here of small-pox, November
12, 1780, and this cenotaph of white marble was erected to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
memory; the body was inclosed in a gold coffin and sent to the
Dalai Lama at Lhassa in 1781. The plinth of this beautiful
work contains scenes in the prelate’s life carved on the panels,
one of which represents a lion rubbing his eyes with his paw as
the tears fall for grief at the Lama’s death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUMMER PALACE AT YUEN-MING YUEN.</div>

<p>The Summer Palace at <i>Yuen-ming Yuen</i> lies about seven
miles from the north-west corner of Peking, and its entire circuit
is reckoned to contain twelve square miles. The country
in this direction rises into gentle hills, and advantage has been
taken of the original surface in the arrangement of the different
parts of the ground, so that the whole presents a great
variety of hill and dale, woodlands and lawns, interspersed with
pools, lakes, caverns, and islets joined by bridges and walks,
their banks thrown up or diversified like the free hand of
nature. Some parts are tilled, groves or tangled thickets occur
here and there, and places are purposely left wild to contrast
the better with the cultivated precincts of a palace, or to form
a rural pathway to a retired temple or arbor. Here were formerly
no less than thirty distinct places of residence for various
palace officials, around which were houses occupied by eunuchs
and servants, each constituting a little village.</p>

<p>But all was swept away by the British and French troops in
1860, and their ruins still remain to irritate the officials and
people of Peking against all foreigners. Near the Summer
Palace is the great cantonment of Hai-tien, where the Manchu
garrison is stationed to defend the capital, and whose troops
did their best in the vain effort to stay the attack in 1860. As
a contrast to the proceedings connected with this approach of
the British, an extract from Sir John Davis’s <cite>Chinese</cite> (chap. x.)
will furnish an index of the changed condition of things.</p>

<p>“It was at a place called Hai-tien, in the immediate vicinity
of these gardens, that the strange scene occurred which terminated
in the dismissal of the embassy of 1816. On his arrival
there, about daylight in the morning, with the commissioners
and a few other gentlemen, the ambassador was drawn
to one of the Emperor’s temporary residences by an invitation
from Duke Ho, as he was called, the imperial relative charged
with the conduct of the negotiations. After passing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
an open court, where were assembled a vast number of grandees
in their dresses of ceremony, they were shown into a wretched
room, and soon encompassed by a well-dressed crowd, among
whom were princes of the blood by dozens, wearing yellow girdles.
With a childish and unmannerly curiosity, consistent
enough with the idle and disorderly life which many of them
are said to lead, they examined the persons and dress of the
gentlemen without ceremony; while these, tired with their
sleepless journey, and disgusted at the behavior of the celestials,
turned their backs upon them, and laid themselves down to rest.
Duke Ho soon appeared, and surprised the ambassador by urging
him to proceed directly to an audience of the Emperor, who
was waiting for him. His lordship in vain remonstrated that
to-morrow had been fixed for the first audience, and that tired
and dusty as they all were at present, it would be worthy
neither of the Emperor nor of himself to wait on his majesty in
a manner so unprepared. He urged, too, that he was unwell,
and required immediate rest. Duke Ho became more and more
pressing, and at length forgot himself so far as to grasp the
ambassador’s arm violently, and one of the others stepped up at
the same time. His lordship immediately shook them off, and
the gentlemen crowded about him; while the highest indignation
was expressed at such treatment, and a determined resolution
to proceed to no audience this morning. The ambassador
at length retired, with the appearance of satisfaction on the
part of Duke Ho, that the audience should take place to-morrow.
There is every reason, however, to suppose that this
person had been largely bribed by the heads of the Canton
local government to frustrate the views of the embassy, and
prevent an audience of the Emperor. The mission, at least, was
on its way back in the afternoon of the same day.”</p>

<p>The principal part of the provisions required for the supply
of this immense city comes from the southern provinces, and
from flocks reared beyond the wall. It has no important
manufactures, horn lanterns, wall papers, stone snuff-bottles,
and pipe mouth-pieces, being the principal. Trade in silks, foreign
fabrics, and food is limited to supplying the local demand,
inasmuch as a heavy octroi duty at the gates restrains all enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>prise.
No foreign merchants are allowed to carry on business
here. The government of Peking differs from that of
other cities in the empire, the affairs of the department being
separated from it, and administered by officers residing in the
four circuits into which it is divided. “A minister of one of
the Boards is appointed superintendent of the city, and subordinate
to him is a <i>fuyin</i>, or mayor. Their duties consist in
having charge of the metropolitan domain, for the purpose of
extending good government to its four divisions. They have
under them two district magistrates, each of whom rules half
the city; none of these officers are subordinate to the provincial
governor, but carry affairs which they cannot determine
to the Emperor. They preside or assist at many of the festivals
observed in the capital, superintend the military police, and
hold the courts which take cognizance of the offences committed
there.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">STREET SCENES AND FEATURES OF PEKING.</div>

<p>The thoroughfares leading across Peking, from one gate to
the other, are broad, unpaved avenues, more than a hundred
feet wide, which appear still wider owing to the lowness of the
buildings; the centre is about two feet higher than the sides.
The cross-streets in the main city are generally at right angles
with them, not over forty feet wide, and for the most part occupied
with dwellings. The inhabitants of the avenues are required
to keep them well sprinkled in summer; but in rainy
weather they are almost impassable from the mud and deep
puddles, the level surface of the ground, and obstructed, neglected
drains, preventing rapid drainage. The crowds which
throng these avenues, some engaged in various callings, along
the sides or in the middle of the way, and others busily passing
and repassing, together with the gay appearance of the sign-boards,
and an air of business in the shops, render the great
streets of the Chinese metropolis very bustling, and to a foreigner
a most interesting scene. Shop-fronts can be entirely
opened when necessary; they are constructed of panels or
shutters fitting into grooves, and secured to a row of strong
posts which set into mortises. At night, when the shop is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
closed, nothing of it is seen from without; but in the daytime,
when the goods are exposed, the scene becomes more animated.</p>

<p>The sign-boards are often broad planks, fixed in stone bases
on each side of the shop-front, and reaching to the eaves, or
above them; the characters are large and of different colors,
and in order to attract more notice, the signs are often hung
with various colored flags, bearing inscriptions setting forth the
excellence of the goods. The shops in the outer city are frequently
constructed in this manner, others are made more compact
for warmth in winter, but as a whole they are not brilliant
in their fittings. Their signs are, when possible, images of
the articles sold and always have a red pennon attached; the
finer shop-fronts are covered with gold-leaf, brilliant when new,
but shabby enough when faded, as it soon does. The appearance
of the main streets exhibits therefore a curious mixture of
decay and renovation, which is not lessened by the dilapidated
temples and governmental buildings everywhere seen, all indicating
the impoverished state of the exchequer. In many parts of
the city are placed <i>pai-lau</i>, or honorary gateways, erected to
mark the approach to the palace, and worthy, by their size and
ornamental entablatures, to adorn the avenues and impress the
traveller, if they were kept in good condition.</p>

<p>The police of the city is connected with the Bannermen, and
is, on the whole, efficient and successful in preserving the peace.
During the night the thoroughfares are quiet; they are lighted
a little by lanterns hanging before the houses, but generally are
dark and cheerless. In the metropolis, as in all Chinese cities,
the air is constantly polluted by the stench arising from private
vessels and public reservoirs for urine and every kind of offal,
which is all carefully collected by scavengers. By this means,
although the streets are kept clean, they are never sweet; but
habit renders the people almost insensible to this as well as
other nuisances. Carts, mules, donkeys and horses are to be
hired in all the thoroughfares. The Manchu women ride
astride; their number in the streets, both riding and walking,
imparts a pleasant feature to the crowd, which is not seen in
cities further south. The extraordinary length and elaborateness
of marriage and funeral processions daily passing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the avenues, adds a pretty feature to them, which other cities
with narrow streets cannot emulate.</p>

<p>The environs beyond the suburbs are occupied with mausolea,
temples, private mansions, hamlets, and cultivated fields, in or
near which are trees, so that the city, viewed from a distance,
appears as if situated in a thick forest. Many interesting points
for the antiquarian and scientist are to be found in and around
this old city, which annually attracts more and more the attention
of other nations. Its population has decreased regularly
since the death of Kienlung in 1797, and is now probably rather
less than one million, including the immediate suburbs. The
climate is healthy, but subject to extremes from zero to 104°;
the dryness during ten months of the year is, moreover, extremely
irritating. The poor, who resort thither from other
parts, form a needy and troublesome ingredient of the population,
sometimes rising in large mobs and pillaging the granaries
to supply themselves with food, but more commonly perishing
in great numbers from cold and hunger. Its peace is always an
object of considerable solicitude with the imperial government,
not only as it may involve the personal safety of the Emperor,
but still more from the disquieting effect it may have upon the
administration of the empire. The possession of this capital by
an invading force is more nearly equivalent to the control of
the country than might be the case in most European kingdoms,
but not as much as it might be in Siam, Burmah, or Japan.
The good influences which may be exerted upon the nation
from the metropolis are likewise correspondingly great, while
the purification of this source of contamination, and the liberalizing
of this centre of power, now well begun in various ways,
will confer a vast benefit upon the Chinese people.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Chihlí contains several other large cities, among which Pauting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the former residence of the governor-general, and Tientsin,
are the most important. The former lies about eighty
miles south-west of the capital, on the Yungting River and the
great road leading to Shansí. The whole department is described
as a thoroughly cultivated, populous region; it is well
watered, and possesses two or three small lakes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TIENTSIN AND THE RIVER.</div>

<p>Tientsin is the largest port on the coast above Shanghai.
Owing, however, to the shallowness of the gulf and the bar at
the mouth of the Pei ho, over which at neap tide only three or
four feet of water flow, the port is rendered inaccessible to large
foreign vessels. Its size and importance were formerly chiefly
owing to its being the terminus of the Grand Canal, where the
produce and taxes for the use of the capital were brought. Mr.
Gutzlaff, who visited Tientsin in 1831, described it as a bustling
place, comparing the stirring life and crowds on the water and
shores outside of the walls of the city with those of Liverpool.
The enormous fleet of grain junks carrying rice to the capital
is supplemented by a still greater number of vessels which take
the food up to Tung chau. Formerly the coast trade increased
the shipping at Tientsin to thousands of junks, including all
which lined the river for about sixty miles. This native trade
has diminished since 1861, inasmuch as steamers are gradually
ousting the native vessels, no one caring to risk insurance on
freight in junks. The country is not very fertile between the
city and the sea, owing to the soda and nitre in the soil; but
scanty crops are brought forth, and these only after much
labor; one is a species of grass (<i>Phragmites</i>) much used in
making floor-mats. Sometimes the rains cause the Pei ho and
its affluents to break over their banks, at which periods their
waters deposit fertilizing matter over large areas.</p>

<p>The approach to Tientsin from the eastward indicates its importance,
and the change from the sparsely populated country
lying along the banks of the Pei ho, to the dense crowds on
shore and the fleets of boats, adds greatly to the vivacity of its
aspect. “If fine buildings and striking localities are required
to give interest to a scene,” remarks Mr. Ellis, “this has no
claims; but, on the other hand, if the gradual crowding of
junks till they become innumerable, a vast population, build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>ings,
though not elegant, yet regular and peculiar, careful and
successful cultivation, can supply these deficiencies, the entrance
to Tientsin will not be without attractions to the traveller.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
The stacks of salt along the river arrest the attention
of the voyager; the immense quantity of this article collected
at this city is only a small portion of the amount consumed in
the interior. Tientsin will gradually increase in wealth, and
now perhaps contains half a million of inhabitants. Its position
renders it one of the most important cities in the empire, and
the key of the capital.</p>

<p>Near the embouchure of the river is Ta-ku, with its forts and
garrison, a small town noticeable as the spot where the first interview
between the Chinese and English plenipotentiaries was
held, in August, 1840; and for three engagements between the
British and Chinese forces in 1858, 1859, and 1860. The general
aspect of the province is flat and cheerless, the soil near
the coast unproductive, but, as a whole, rich and well cultivated,
though the harvests are jeopardized by frequent droughts.</p>

<p>The port of Peking is Tung chau on the Pei ho, twelve miles
from the east gate, and joined to it by an elevated stone causeway.
All boats here unload their passengers and freight, which
are transported in carts, wheelbarrows, or on mules and donkeys.
The city of Tung chau presents a dilapidated appearance amidst
all its business and trade, and its population depends on the
transit of goods for their chief support. The streets are paved,
the largest of them having raised footpaths on their sides.
The houses indicate a prosperous community. A single pagoda
towers nearly 200 feet above them, and forms a waymark for
miles across the country. Tung chau is only 100 feet above
the sea, from which it is distant 120 miles in a direct line; consequently,
its liability to floods is a serious drawback to its permanent
prosperity.</p>

<p>Another city of note is Siuenhwa fu, finely situated between
the branches of the Great Wall. Timkowski remarks, “the
crenated wall which surrounds it is thirty feet high, and puts
one in mind of that of the Kremlin, and resembles those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
several towns in Russia; it consists of two thin parallel brick
walls, the intermediate space being filled with clay and sand.
The wall is flanked with towers. We passed through three
gates to enter the city: the first is covered with iron nails; at
the second is the guard-house; we thence proceeded along a
broad street, bordered with shops of hardware; we went through
several large and small streets, which are broad and clean; but,
considering its extent, the city is thinly peopled.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The department of Chahar, or Tsakhar, lies beyond the Great
Wall, north and west of the province, a mountainous and thinly
settled country, chiefly inhabited by Mongol shepherds who keep
the flocks and herds of the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DOLON-NOR AND TOWNS IN THE NORTH.</div>

<p>In the north-east of their grounds lies the thriving town of
Dolon-nor (<i>i.e.</i>, Seven Lakes), or Lama-miao, of about 20,000
Chinese, founded by Kanghí. The Buddhist temples and manufactories
of bells, idols, praying machines, and other religious
articles found here, give it its name, and attract the Mongols,
whose women array themselves in the jewelry made here. It
is in latitude 42° 16′ N., about ten miles from the Shangtu
River, a large branch of the river Liao, on a sandy plain, and is
approached by a road winding among several lakes. North-west
of Dolon-nor are the ruins of the ancient Mongolian capital of
Shangtu, rendered more famous among English reading people
by Coleridge’s exquisite <span class="lock">poem&mdash;</span></p>

<p>than by Marco Polo’s relation, which moved the poet to pen
the lines. It was planned as Mukden now is, an outer and inner
wall inclosing separate peoples, and its tumuli will probably furnish
many tablets and relics of the Mongol emperors, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
carefully dug over. It was too far from Peking for the Manchu
monarchs to rebuild, and the Ming emperors had no power
there. It was visited in 1872 by Messrs. Grosvenor and Bushell
of the British Legation; Dr. Bushell’s description corroborates
Polo’s account and Gerbillon’s later notices of its size.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>There are several lakes, the largest of which, the Peh hu, in
the south-western part, connects with the Pei ho through the
river Hü-to. The various branches of the five rivers, whose
united waters disembogue at Ta-ku, afford a precarious water
communication through the southern half of Chihlí. Their headwaters
rise in Shansí and beyond the Great Wall, bringing down
much silt, which their lower currents only partially take out into
the gulf; this sediment soon destroys the usefulness of the
channels by raising them dangerously near the level of the banks.
The utilization of their streams is a difficult problem in civil
engineering, not only here but throughout the Great Plain.</p>

<p>Near the banks of the Lan ho, a large stream flowing south
from the eastern slopes of the Chahar Hills, past Yungping fu
into the gulf, and about one hundred and seventy-four miles
north of Ta-ku, lies Chingpeh, or Jeh-ho, the Emperor’s country
palace. The approach to it is through a pass cut out of the
rock, and resembles that leading to Damascus. The imperial
grounds are embraced by a high range of hills forming a grand
amphitheatre, which at this point is extremely fine. This descent
to the city presents new and captivating views at every
turn of the road. The hunting grounds are inclosed by a high
wall stretching twenty miles over the hills, and stocked with
deer, elks, and other game. The Buddhist temples form the
chief attraction to a visitor. The largest one is square and castellated,
eleven stories high, and about two hundred feet on
each of its sides; the stories are painted red, yellow and green
alternating. There are several similar but smaller structures
below this one, and on each of the first two or three series is a
row of small chinaware pagodas of a blue color; their tiles are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
likewise blue. In the bright sunlight the effect of these brilliant
bands is very good, and the general neatness adds to the
pleasing result of the gay coloring. Nearly a thousand lamas
live about these shrines. The town of Jeh-ho (<i>i.e.</i>, Hot River)
consists mostly of one street coiling around the hills near the
palace; its inhabitants are of a higher grade than usual in
Chinese cities, the greater part being connected with the government.
The road through Ku-peh kau in the Great Wall
from Peking to Jeh-ho is one of the best in the province, and
the journey presents a variety of charming scenery; its chief
interest to foreigners is connected with the visit there of Lord
Macartney, in 1793.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> This fertile prefecture is rapidly settling
by Chinese, whose numbers are now not far from two millions.</p>

<p>The principal productions of Chihlí are millet and wheat,
sorghum, maize, oats, and many kinds of pulse and fruits,
among which are pears, dried and fresh dates (<i>Rhamnus</i>),
apples and grapes; all these are exported. Coal, both bituminous
and anthracite, exists in great abundance; one mode of
using hard coal is to mix its dust with powdered clay and work
them into balls and cakes for cooking and fuel. The province
also furnishes good marble, granite, lime, and iron, some kinds
of precious stones, and clay for bricks and pottery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHANTUNG PROVINCE.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Shantung</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, East of the Hills) has a long
coast-line, its maritime border being more than half its whole
circuit. It lies south of the Gulf of Pechele, south-east of
Chihlí, north of Kiangsu, and borders on Honan, where the
Yellow River divides the two. Most of its area is level, the
hilly part is the peninsula portion, where the highest points
rise too high to admit of cultivation. The Grand Canal enters
the province on its course from Tientsin at Lintsing chau in the
north-west, passing in a south-easterly direction to the old Yellow
River, and adds greatly to its importance. The shores of
the promontory are generally bold, and full of indentations,
presenting several excellent harbors; no important river disembogues
within the province, and on each side of the peninsula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the waters are shallow. Chifu, in the prefecture of Tăngchau,
has the best harbor, and its trade will gradually draw toward it
a large population. The hills along the shore have a remarkably
uniform, conical shape, resembling the bonnets worn by
officers. The hilly regions are arranged in a series of chains
running across the promontory, the longest and highest of
which runs with the general trend of the coast in Tai-ngan fu,
some peaks reaching over five thousand feet, but most of them
being under three thousand feet high. Their intervales are
highly cultivated. The soil is generally productive, except
near the shores of the gulf, where it is nitrous. Two crops are
annually produced here as elsewhere in Northern China. The
willow, aspen, ailantus, locust (<i>Sophora</i>), oak, mulberry, and
conifera, are common trees; silk-worms fed on oak leaves furnish
silk.</p>

<p>This province is one of the most celebrated in Chinese history,
partly from its having been the scene of many remarkable events
in the early history of the people up to <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 200, but more particularly
from its containing the birthplaces of Confucius and
Mencius, whose fame has gone over the earth. The inhabitants
of the province are proud of their nativity on this score,
much as the woman of Samaria was because Jacob’s cattle had
drunk water at the well of Sychar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAI SHAN, THE ‘GREAT MOUNT.’</div>

<p>The high mountain called Tai shan, or ‘Great mount,’ is situated
near Tai-ngan fu in this province. This peak is mentioned
in the <cite>Shu King</cite> as that where Shun sacrificed to Heaven (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
2254); it is accordingly celebrated for its historical as well as
religious associations. It towers high above all other peaks in
the range, as if keeping solitary watch over the country round-about,
and is the great rendezvous of devotees; every sect has
there its temples and idols, scattered up and down its sides, in
which priests chant their prayers, and practise a thousand superstitions
to attract pilgrims to their shrines. During the spring,
the roads leading to the Tai shan are obstructed with long
caravans of people coming to accomplish their vows, to supplicate
the deities for health or riches, or to solicit the joys of
heaven in exchange for the woes of earth. A French missionary
mentions having met with pilgrims going to it, one party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of whom consisted of old dames, who had with infinite fatigue
and discomfort come from the south of Honan, about three
hundred miles, to “remind their god of the long abstinence
from flesh and fish they had observed during the course of their
lives, and solicit, as a recompense, a happy transmigration for
their souls.” The youngest of this party was 78, and the oldest
90 years.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Another traveller says that the pilgrims resort there
during the spring, when there are fairs to attract them; high
and low, official and commoner, men and women, old and
young, all sorts gather to worship and traffic. A great temple
lies outside the town, whose grounds furnish a large and secure
area for the tents where the devotees amuse themselves, after
they have finished their devotions. The road to the summit is
about five miles, well paved and furnished with rest-houses,
tea-stalls, and stairways for the convenience of the pilgrims,
and shaded with cypresses. It is beset with beggars, men and
women with all kinds of sores and diseases, crippled and injured,
besieging travellers with cries and self-imposed sufferings,
frequently lying across the path so as to be stepped upon.
A vast number of them live on alms thus collected, and have
scooped themselves holes in the side of the way, where they
live; their numbers indicate the great crowds whose offerings
support such a wretched throng on the hill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CITIES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF SHANTUNG.</div>

<p>The capital of the province is Tsínan, a well-built city of
about 100,000 inhabitants. It was an important town in ancient
times as the capital of Tsí, one of the influential feudal
States, from <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1100 to its conquest by Chí Hwangtí about
230; the present town lies not far east of the Ta-tsing ho, or
new Yellow River, and is accessible by small steamers from sea.
It has hills around it, and is protected by three lines of defence,
composed of mud, granite, and brick. Three copious springs
near the western gate furnish pure water, which is tepid and so
abundant as to fill the city moat and form a lake for the solace
of the citizens whether in boats upon its bosom or from temples
around its shores. Its manufactures are strong fabrics of wild
silk, and ornaments of <i>liu-lí</i>, a vitreous substance like strass, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
which snuff-bottles, bangles, cups, etc., are made in great variety,
to resemble serpentine, jade, ice, and other things. East of Tsínan
is the prefect city of Tsíning chau, once the provincial capital,
and the centre of a populous and fertile region. Tsíning
chau is an opulent and flourishing place, judging from the
gilded and carved shops, temples, and public offices in the suburbs,
which stretch along the eastern banks of the Canal; just
beyond the town, the Canal is only a little raised above the level
of the extensive marshes on each side, and further south the
swamps increase rapidly: when Amherst’s embassy passed, the
whole country, as far as the eye could reach, displayed the effects
of a most extensive recent inundation. Davis adds, “The
waters were on a level with those of the Canal, and there was
no need of dams, which were themselves nearly under water,
and sluices for discharging the superfluous water were occasionally
observed. Clumps of large trees, cottages, and towers, were
to be seen on all sides, half under water, and deserted by the
inhabitants; the number of the latter led to the inference that
they were provided as places of refuge in case of inundation,
which must be here very frequent. Wretched villages occurred
frequently on the right-hand bank, along which the tracking
path was in some places so completely undermined as to give
way at every step, obliging them to lay down hurdles of reeds
to afford a passage.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Lin-tsing chau, on the Yu ho, at its junction with the Canal,
lies in the midst of a beautiful country, full of gardens and cultivated
grounds, interspersed with buildings. This place is the
dépôt for produce brought on the Canal, and a rendezvous for
large fleets of boats and barges. Near it is a pagoda in good
repair, about 150 feet high, the basement of which is built of
granite, and the other stories of glazed bricks.</p>

<p>The towns and villages of Shantung have been much visited
during the past few years, and their inhabitants have become
better acquainted with foreigners, with whom increased intercourse
has developed its good and bad results. The productions
of this fertile province comprise every kind of grain and vege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>table
found in Northern China, and its trade by sea and along
the Canal opens many outlets for enterprising capital. Among
its mineral productions are gold, copper, asbestos, galena, antimony,
silver, sulphur, fine agates, and saltpetre; the first occurs
in the beds of streams. All these yield in real importance, however,
to the coal and iron, which are abundant, and have been
worked for ages. Its manufactures supply the common clothing
and utensils of its people; silk fabrics, straw braid woven
from a kind of wheat, glass, cheap earthenware, and rugs of
every pattern.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens, an American missionary who visited Wei-hai
wei and Chifu in 1837, gives a description of the people, which
is still applicable to most parts of the province: “These poor
people know nothing, from youth to old age, but the same
monotonous round of toil for a subsistence, and never see, never
hear anything of the world around them. Improvements in
the useful arts and sciences, and an increase of the conveniences
of life, are never known among them. In the place
where their fathers lived and died, do they live, and toil, and
die, to be succeeded by another generation in the same manner.
Few of the comforts of life can be found among them; their
houses consisted in general of granite and thatched roofs, but
neither table, chair, nor floor, nor any article of furniture could
be seen in the houses of the poorest. Every man had his pipe,
and tea was in most dwellings. They were industriously engaged,
some in ploughing, others in reaping, some carrying out
manure, and others bringing home produce; numbers were collected
on the thrashing-floors, winnowing, sifting and packing
wheat, rice, millet, peas, and in drying maize, all with the
greatest diligence. Here, too, were their teams for ploughing,
yoked together in all possible ludicrous combinations; sometimes
a cow and an ass; or a cow, an ox and an ass; or a cow
and two asses; or four asses; and all yoked abreast. All the
women had small feet, and wore a pale and sallow aspect, and
their miserable, squalid appearance excited an indelible feeling
of compassion for their helpless lot. They were not always shy,
but were generally ill-clad and ugly, apparently laboring in the
fields like the men. But on several occasions, young ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
clothed in gay silks and satins, riding astride upon bags on donkeys,
were seen. No prospect of melioration for either men or
women appears but in the liberalizing and happy influences of
Christianity.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">NATURAL FEATURES OF SHANSÍ.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Shansí</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, West of the Hills) lies between
Chihlí and Shensí, and north of Honan; the Yellow River
bounds it on the west and partly on the south, and the Great
Wall forms most of the northern frontier. It measures 55,268
square miles, nearly the same as England and Wales, or the
State of Illinois. This province is the original seat of the
Chinese people; and many of the places mentioned and the
scenes recorded in their ancient annals occurred within its borders.
Its rugged surface presents a striking contrast to the level
tracts in Chihlí and Shantung. The southern portion of Shansí,
including the region down to the Yellow River, in all an area
of 30,000 square miles, presents a geological formation of great
simplicity from Hwai king as far north as Ping ting. The plain
around the first-named city is bounded on the north by a steep,
castellated range of hills which varies from 1,000 to 1,500 feet
in height; it has few roads or streams crossing it. On reaching
the top, an undulating table-land stretches northward, varying
from 2,500 to 3,000 feet above the Plain, consisting of coal formation,
above the limestone of the lower steep hills. About
forty miles from those hills, there is a second rise like the first,
up which the road takes one to another plateau, nearly 6,000
feet above the sea. This plateau is built up of later rocks, sandstones,
shales, and conglomerates of green, red, yellow, lilac,
and brown colors, and is deeply eroded by branches of the Tsin
River, which finally flow into the Yellow River. This plateau
has its north-west border in the Wu ling pass, beyond which
begins the descent to the basin of the Făn River. That basin
is traversed near its eastern side by the Hoh shan nearly to Taiyuen;
its peaks rise to 8,000 feet in some places; the rocks are
granite and divide the coal measures, anthracite lying on its
eastern side and bituminous on the west, as far as the Yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
River, and north as far as Ta-tung. On top of both plateaus is
spread the loess deposit, varying in depth from ten to five hundred
feet, and deeply gullied by water-courses in every direction,
which expose coal and iron mines.</p>

<p>On the eastern side of Shansí the rocks are made up of ancient
formations or deposits of the Silurian age, presenting a
series of peaks, passes and ranges that render travel very difficult
down to the Plain. By these outlying ranges the province
is isolated from Chihlí, as no useful water communication exists.
This coal and iron formation is probably the largest in the
world, and when railroads open it up to easy access it can be
readily worked along the water-courses. The northern part of
the province is drained through the rivers ending at Tientsin.
This elevated region cannot be artificially irrigated, and when the
rainfall is too small or too late, the people suffer from famine.
The northern and southern prefectures exhibit great diversity in
their animal, mineral, and vegetable productions. Some of the
favorite imperial hunting-grounds are in the north; from the
coal, iron, cinnabar, copper, marble, lapis-lazuli, jasper, salt, and
other minerals which it affords, the inhabitants gain much of
their wealth. The principal grains are wheat and millet, a
large variety of vegetables and fruits, such as persimmons, pears,
dates and grapes. The rivers are not large, and almost every
one of them is a tributary of the Yellow River. The Făn ho,
about 300 miles long, is the most important, and empties into
it near the south-western corner of the province, after draining
the central section. East of this stream, as far as the headwaters
of those rivers flowing into Chihlí, extends an undulating
table-land, having a general altitude of 3,000 feet above
the Plain. South of it runs the river Kiang, also an affluent
of the Yellow River, and near this, in Kiai chau, is a remarkable
deposit of salt in a shallow lake (18 miles long and 3
broad), which is surrounded by a high wall. The salt is evaporated
in the sun under government direction, the product bringing
in a large revenue; the adjacent town of Lung-tsüen, containing
80,000 inhabitants, is devoted to the business. Salt has
been obtained from this region for two thousand years; the
water in some of the springs is only brackish, and used in culi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>nary
operations. There are two smaller lakes nearer the Yellow
River.</p>

<p>The iron obtained in the lower plateau, in the south-east near
Tsih chau, is from clay iron-ore and spathic ore with hematite,
which occurs in limestone strata at the bottom of the coal formations.
It is extracted in a rude manner, but the produce is
equal to any iron in the world, while its price is only about
two cents a pound. The working and transportation of coal
and iron employ myriads of people, though they are miserably
paid. The province barely supplies its own cotton, but woollen
garments and sheepskins are produced to make up the demand
for clothing.</p>

<p>Taiyuen fu, the capital, lies on the northern border of a fertile
plain, 3,000 feet above the sea level; this plain extends
about 2,000 square miles, and owes its existence to the gradual
filling up of a lake there, the waters having cut their way out,
and left the river Făn to drain the surplus. Across the Ho shan
range lies another basin of equal fertility and mineral wealth, in
Ping-ting chau, where coal, iron, clay and stone exist in unlimited
quantities. In the northern part of this province the Buddhist
temples at Wu-tai shan in Tai chau draw vast crowds of votaries
to their shrines. The hills in which they are built rise
prominently above the range, and each celebrated locality is
memorialized by its own particular divinity, and the buildings
where he is worshipped. The presence of a living Buddha, or
<i>Gegen</i>, here attracts thousands of Mongols from the north to
adore him; their toilsome journey adding to the worth of the
visit. Most of the lamas are from the north and west. The
region north of this seems to be gradually losing its fertility,
owing to the sand which is drifted by north winds from the
Ortous steppes; and as all the hills are bare of trees, the whole
of Shansí seems destined to increasing poverty and barrenness.
Its inhabitants are shrewd, enterprising traders as well as frugal
agriculturists; many of the bankers in the Empire are from its
cities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNTAIN PASSES IN SHANSÍ.</div>

<p>The great roads from Peking to the south-west and west pass
through all the chief towns of this province, and when new
probably equalled in engineering and construction anything of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the kind ever built by the Romans. The stones with which
they are paved average 15 inches in thickness. Few regions
can exceed in natural difficulties some of the passes over the
loess-covered tracts of this province, where the road must wind
through miles of narrow cuts in the light and tenacious soil, to
emerge before a landscape such as that seen in the illustration.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROVINCE OF HONAN.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Honan</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, South of the River) comprises
some of the most fertile parts of the Plain, and, on account of
its abundance and central position, early received the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
<i>Chung Hwa Tí</i>, or the ‘Middle Flowery Land,’ afterwards enlarged
into <i>Chung Kwoh</i>, or ‘Middle Kingdom.’ Its form is an
irregular triangle, and its size nearly the same as Shantung; it
has Shansí and Chihlí on the north, Nganhwui on the south-east,
Hupeh on the south and south-west, and Shensí on the
west, bordering also on Shantung and Kiangsu. This area is
divided into three basins, that of the Yellow River in the
north, of the Hwai River on the south, and the Han River on
the south-west; the last two are separated by a marked range of
mountains, the Fuh-niu shan, which is regarded as the eastern
terminus of the Kwănlun Mountains; it is about 300 miles long,
and its eastern end is near Jü-ning fu. This range maintains
an elevation of 4,000 to 6,000 feet, and is crossed at Nanchau,
where a remarkable natural pass about 30 miles long, rising to
1,200 or 1,500 feet, affords the needed facilities for trade and
travel between the central and northern provinces. The Peh
and Tan rivers drain its southern slopes into the Han, and the
eastern sides are abundantly watered by the numerous branches
of the Hwai River as they flow into Hungtsih Lake. The
northern portion of Honan along the Yellow River is level,
fertile and populous, forming one of the richest portions of the
province.</p>

<p>For its climate, productions, literary reputation, historical
associations, and variety of scenery, this province takes a prominent
rank. The earliest records of the Black-haired race refer
to this region, and the struggles for dominion among feudal
and imperial armies occurred in its plains. Its present difficulty
of access from the coast will ere long be overcome by railroads,
when its capabilities may be further developed, and the
cotton, hemp, iron, tutenag, silk and coal be increased for exportation.
The people at present consume their own food and
manufactures, and only require a good demand to increase the
quality and amounts and exchange them for other things. The
three prefectures north of the Yellow River are low-lying;
through these the waters of that river have recently found
their way into the River Wei and thence to the Gulf of Pechele,
at Măng-tsin or east of it; the gradual rise of the bed renders
their levels nearly the same, while it makes the main stream so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
broad and shallow that it is of little use for navigation. These
plains are traversed by wheelbarrows and carts, whose drivers
and trundlers form a vast body of stalwart men constantly going
about in their employment from one city to another.</p>

<p>Kaifung fu, or Pien-liang, the capital, is situated about a
league from the southern bank of the Yellow River, whose bed
is here elevated above the adjacent country. It was the metropolis
from <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 960 to 1129, and has often suffered from attacks
of armies as well as from inundations. The dikes are mostly
on the northern shore, and exhibit the industry and unavailing
efforts of the people for scores of leagues. During the period
of the Manchu conquest Kaifung was defended by a loyal general,
who, seeing no other resource against the invaders, broke
down the embankments to drown them, by which manœuvre
upwards of 300,000 of the inhabitants perished. The city was
rebuilt, but it has not attained to its ancient splendor, if credit
can be given to the <cite>Statistics of Kaifung</cite>, in which work it
is described as having been six leagues in circuit in the twelfth
century, approached by five roads, and containing numerous
palaces, gardens, and government houses. The valley of the
River Loh lies between the Yellow River and the Fuh-niu Mountains,
a fertile, populous region wherein many of the remarkable
events of Chinese history were enacted. Loh-yang, near Honan,
was the metropolis at three different intervals, and probably
further researches here will bring to light many ancient relics;
rock-cut temples and old inscriptions, with graceful bas-reliefs,
near the natural gate of Lung-măn, where the road crosses Sung
shan, have already been seen. Owing to the direction of the
roads leading through this region from the south and east, and
the passes for travel towards the north-west, it will form a very
important centre of trade in the future of Central Asia and
western China.</p>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Kiangsu</span> is named from the first syllable of
the capital, Kiangning, joined to Su, part of the name of the
richest city, Suchau. It lies along the sea-coast, in a north-westerly
direction, having Shantung on the north, Nganhwui
on the west, and Chehkiang on the south. The area is about
45,000 square miles, equalling Pennsylvania or a little less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
England by itself. It consists, with little interruption, of level
tracts interspersed with lakes and marshes, through which flow
their two noble rivers, which as they are the source of the extraordinary
fertility of this region, so also render it obnoxious
to freshes, or cover the low portions with irreclaimable morasses.
The region of Kiangnan is where the beauty and riches
of China are most amply displayed; “and whether we consider,”
remarks Gutzlaff, speaking of this and the adjoining
province, “their agricultural resources, their great manufactures,
their various productions, their excellent situation on the
banks of these two large streams, their many canals and tributary
rivers, these two provinces doubtless constitute the best
territory of China.” The staple productions are grain, cotton,
tea, silk, and rice, and most kinds of manufactures are here
carried to the greatest perfection. The people have an exceptional
reputation for intelligence and wit, and although the
province has long ceased to possess a court, its cities still present
a gayer aspect, and are adorned with better structures than
any others in the empire. This province was the scene of the
dreadful ravages of the Tai-ping rebellion, and large districts
are still desolate, while their cities lie waste.</p>

<p>Probably no other country of equal extent is better watered
than Kiangsu. The Great River, the Grand Canal, many
smaller streams and canals, and a succession of lakes along the
line of the canal, afford easy communication through every part.
The sea-coast has not been surveyed north of the Yangtsz’,
where it is unapproachable in large vessels; dykes have been
constructed in some portions to prevent the in-flow of the
ocean. The largest lake is the Hungtsih, about two hundred
miles in circumference. South of it lies Kauyu Lake, and on
the eastern side of the canal opposite is Pauying Lake, both of
them broad sheets of water. Numerous small lakes lie around
them. Tai hu, or ‘Great Lake,’ lies partly in Kiangsu and
partly in Chehkiang, and is the largest in the province. Its
borders are skirted by romantic scenery, while its bosom is
broken by numerous islets, affording convenient resort to the
fishermen who get their subsistence from its waters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CITY OF NANKING.</div>

<p>Kiangning fu (better known abroad as Nanking), the capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of the province, is situated on the south shore of the Yangtsz’,
194 miles from Shanghai. It was the metropolis from <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 317
to 582, and again for 35 years during the Ming dynasty (1368-1403).
This city is the natural location of an imperial court,
accessible by land and water from all quarters, and susceptible
of sure defence. When the Tai-pings were expelled in 1865,
the city was nearly destroyed, and has since that date only
slowly revived. When Hungwu made it his capital, he
strengthened the wall around it, inclosing a great area, 35 miles
in circuit, which was never fully covered with buildings, and at
present has a most ruinous appearance. Davis remarks the
striking resemblance between Rome and Nanking, the area
within the walls of both being partially inhabited, and ruins of
buildings lying here and there among the cultivated fields, the
melancholy remains of departed glory. Both of them, however,
have now brighter prospects for the future.</p>

<p>The part occupied by the Manchus is separated by a cross
wall from the Chinese town. The great extent of the wall
renders the defence of the city difficult, besides which it is
overlooked from the hills on the east, from one of which, the
Chung shan, a wide view of the surrounding country can be
obtained. On this eastern face are three gates; the land near
the two toward the river is marshy, and the gates are approached
on stone causeys. A deep canal runs up from the
river directly under the walls on the west, serving to strengthen
the approaches on that side. Nanking is laid out in four
rather wide and parallel avenues intersected by others of less
width; and though not so broad as those of Peking, are on the
whole clean, well-paved, and bordered with handsomely furnished
shops.</p>

<p>The only remarkable monuments of royalty which remain are
several guardian statues situated not far from the walls. These
statues form an avenue leading up to the sepulchre where the
Emperor Hungwu was buried about 1398. They consist of
gigantic figures like warriors cased in armor, standing on either
side of the road, across which at intervals large stone tablets are
extended, supported by great blocks of stone instead of pillars.
Situated at some distance are a number of rude colossal figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of horses, elephants, and other animals, all intended to represent
the guardians of the mighty dead.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PORCELAIN TOWER OF NANKING.</div>

<p>Nothing made Nanking more celebrated abroad than the
Porcelain Tower, called <i>Pao-ngăn tah</i>, or the ‘Recompensing
Favor Monastery,’ which stood pre-eminent above all other
similar buildings in China for its completeness and elegance,
the material of which it was built, and the quantity of gilding
with which its interior was embellished. It was erected by
Yungloh to recompense the great favor of her majesty the
Empress, and occupied 19 years (1411-1430) in its construction.
It was maintained in good condition by the government, and
three stories which had been thrown down by lightning in
1801 were rebuilt. The Tai-pings blew it up and carried off the
bricks in 1856, fearing lest its geomantic influences should work
against the success of their cause. As to its dimensions: Its
form was octagonal, divided into nine equal stories, the circumference
of the lower story being 120 feet, decreasing gradually
to the top. Its base rested upon a solid foundation of brick-work
ten feet high, up which a flight of twelve steps led into
the tower, whence a spiral staircase of 190 steps carried the
visitor to the summit, 261 feet from the ground. The outer
face was covered with slabs of glazed porcelain of various
colors, principally green, red, yellow, and white, the body of
the edifice being brick. At every story was a projecting roof,
covered with green tiles; from each corner and from the top of
these roofs were suspended bells, numbering 150 in all.</p>

<p>This beautiful structure was visited in 1852 by Dr. Charles
Taylor, an American missionary, who has left a full account of
his observations.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It was to have been raised to an altitude of
329 feet and of thirteen stories, but only nine were built; careful
measurement gave 261 feet as its height, 8&frac12; feet its thickness
at top, and 12 feet at the base, where it was 96 feet 10 inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in diameter. The facing was of bricks made of fine porcelain
clay; the prevailing color was green, owing to the predominance
of the tiles on the numerous stories. The woodwork supporting
these successive roofs was strong, curiously carved and
richly painted. The many-colored tiles and bricks were highly
glazed, giving the building a gay and beautiful appearance, that
was greatly heightened when seen in the reflected sunlight.
When new it had 140 lamps, most of them hanging outside;
and a native writer says “that when lighted they illumine the
33 heavens, and detect the good and evil among men, as well
as forever ward off human miseries.” The destruction of a
building like this, from mere fanciful ideas, goes far to explain
the absence of all old or great edifices in China.</p>

<p>Nanking has extensive manufactories of fine satin and crape,
Nankeen cotton cloth, paper and ink of fine quality, and beautiful
artificial flowers of pith paper. In distant parts of the
empire, any article which is superior to the common run of
workmanship, is said to be from Nanking, though the speaker
means only that it was made in that region. It is renowned,
too, for its scholars and literary character, and in this particular
stands among the first places of learning in the country. It
is the residence of the governor-general of three provinces,
and consequently the centre of a large concourse of officials,
educated men, and students seeking for promotion; these, with
its large libraries and bookstores, all indicating and assisting
literary pursuits, combine to give it this distinguished position.
In the monastery on Golden Island, near Chinkiang, a library
was found by the English officers, but there was no haste in examining
its contents, as they intended to have carried off the
whole collection, had not peace prevented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CITIES OF SUCHAU AND CHINKIANG.</div>

<p>The city of Suchau now exceeds Nanking in size and riches.
It is situated on islands lying in the Ta hu, and from this sheet
of water many streams and canals connect the city with most
parts of the department. The walls are about ten miles in circumference;
outside of them are four suburbs, one of which is
said to extend ten miles, besides which there is an immense
floating population. The whole space includes many canals and
pools connected with the Grand Canal and the lake, and pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>sented
in 1859 a scene of activity, industry, and riches which
could not be surpassed elsewhere in China. The population
probably then exceeded a million, including the suburbs. It
lies north-west of Shanghai, the way passing through a continual
range of villages and cities; the environs are highly cultivated,
producing cotton, silk, rice, wheat, fruits, and vegetables. It
was captured in 1860 by the rebels, and when retaken in 1865
was nearly reduced to a heap of ruins. It is, however, rapidly
reviving, as the loss of life was comparatively small.</p>

<p>The Chinese regard this as one of their richest and most
beautiful cities, and have a saying, “that to be happy on earth,
one must be born in Suchau, live in Canton, and die in Liauchau,
for in the first are the handsomest people, in the second
the most costly luxuries, and in the third the best coffins.”
It has a high reputation for its buildings, the elegance of its
tombs, the picturesque scenery of its waters and gardens, the
politeness and intelligence of its inhabitants, and the beauty of
its women. Its manufactures of silk, linen, cotton, and works in
iron, ivory, wood, horn, glass, lackered-ware, paper, and other
articles, are the chief sources of its wealth and prosperity; the
kinds of silk goods produced here surpass in variety and richness
those woven in any other place. Vessels can proceed up
to the city by several channels from the Yangtsz’ kiang, but
junks of large burden anchor at Shanghai, or Sungkiang; the
whole country is so intersected by natural and artificial water-courses,
that the people have hardly any need for roads and
carts, but get about in barrows and sedans. Small steamers
find their way to every large village at high tide.</p>

<p>Chinkiang, situated at the junction of the Grand Canal with
the Yangtsz’ kiang, was captured by the British in July, 1842,
at a great loss of life to its defenders; the Manchu general Hai-ling,
finding the city taken, seated himself in his office, and set
fire to the house, making it his funeral pyre. Its position
renders it the key of the country, in respect to the transport of
produce, taxes and provisions for Peking, inasmuch as when the
river and canal are both blockaded, the supplies for the north
and south are to a great extent intercepted. In times of peace
the scenes at the junction afford a good exhibition of the indus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>try
and trade of the people. Barrow describes, in 1794, “the
multitude of ships of war, of burden and of pleasure, some
gliding down the stream, others sailing against it; some moving
by oars, and others lying at anchor; the banks on either side
covered with towns and houses as far as the eye could reach;
as presenting a prospect more varied and cheerful than any that
had hitherto occurred. Nor was the canal, on the opposite
side, less lively. For two whole days we were continually
passing among fleets of vessels of different construction and
dimensions.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The country in the vicinity is well cultivated, moderately
hilly, and presents a characteristic view of Chinese life and
action. “On the south-east, the hills broke into an undulating
country clothed with verdure, and firs bordering upon small
lakes. Beyond, stretched the vast river we had just ascended.
In the other direction, the land in the foreground continued a
low and swampy flat, leaving it difficult at a little distance to
determine which of the serpentine channels was the main
branch; there were innumerable sheets of water, separated by
narrow mounds, so that the whole resembled a vast lake, intersected
by causeways. Willows grew along their sides, and
dwellings were erected on small patches somewhat higher than
the common surface.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> This whole country was the scene of
dreadful fighting for many years. Between the Imperialists
and Tai-pings the city was totally destroyed, so that in 1861
hardly a house was left. It is now regaining its natural trade
and prosperity.</p>

<p>Near the mouth of the Grand Canal is Kin shan, or Golden
Island,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> a beautiful spot, covered with temples and monastic
establishments. A pagoda crowns the summit, and there are
many pavilions and halls, of various sizes and degrees of elegance,
on its sides and at the base, many of them showing
their imperial ownership by the yellow or green tiling. Since
the river has been open to traffic, and the devastations of the
Tai-pings have ceased, the priests have returned in small num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>bers
to their abodes, but the whole settlement is a poor
mockery of its early splendor. A similar one, rather larger, is
found at Siung shan, or Silver Island, below Chinkiang; it is,
however, on a less extensive scale, though in a beautiful situation.
Priests are the only occupants; temples and palaces the
principal buildings, surrounded by gardens and bowers. Massive
granite terraces, decorated with huge stone monsters, are
reached from the water by broad flights of steps; fine temples,
placed to be seen, and yet shaded by trees, open pavilions, and
secluded summer-houses, give it a delightful air of retreat and
comfort, which a nearer inspection sadly disappoints.</p>

<p>The banks of the Yangtsz’ during the 250 miles of its course
through this province, are uniformly low, and no towns of importance
occur close to them, as they would be exposed to the
floods. The vast body of water, with its freight of millions of
tons of silt goes on its way in a quiet equable current into the
Yellow Sea. The dense population of the prefectures on the
south bank, contrasted with the sparseness of the region between
the Canal and seashore on the north side, indicate the comparative
barrenness of the latter, and the difficulty of cultivating
marshy lands so nearly level with the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHANGHAI.</div>

<p>The largest seaport in Kiangsu is Shanghai (<i>i.e.</i>, Approaching
the Sea), now become one of the leading emporia in Asia. It
lies on the north shore of the Wusung River, about fourteen
miles from its mouth, in lat. 31° 10′ N., and long. 121° 30′ E.,
at the junction of the Hwang-pu with it, and by means of both
streams communicates with Suchau, Sungkiang, and other large
cities on the Grand Canal; while by the Yangtsz’ it receives
produce from Yunnan and Sz’chuen. In these respects its position
resembles that of New Orleans.</p>

<p>The town of Wusung is at the mouth of that river, here
about a mile wide; and two miles beyond lies the district town
of Paushan. The wall of Shanghai is three miles in circuit,
through which six gates open into extensive suburbs; around the
ramparts flows a ditch twenty feet wide. The city stands in a
wide plain of extraordinary fertility, intersected by numerous
streamlets, and affording ample means of navigation and communication;
its population is estimated to be at present over 500,000,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
but the data for this figure are rather imperfect. Since it
was opened to foreign commerce in 1843, the growth of the
town has been rapid in every element of prosperity, though
subject to great vicissitudes by reason of the rebellion which
devastated the adjoining country. Its capture by the insurgents
in 1851, and their expulsion in February, 1853, with the destruction
of the eastern and southern suburbs in 1860, have
been its chief disasters since that date. The native trade has
gradually passed from the unwieldy and unsafe junks which
used to throng the Hwang-pu east of the city, into steamers
and foreign craft, and is now confined, so far as the vessels are
concerned, to the inland and coast traffic in coarse, cheap articles.</p>

<p>Shanghai city itself is a dirty place, and poorly built. The
houses are mostly made of bluish square brick, imperfectly
burned; and the walls are constructed in a cellular manner by
placing bricks on their edges, and covering them with stucco.
The streets are about eight feet wide, paved with stone slabs,
and in the daytime crowded with people. Silk and embroidery,
cotton, and cotton goods, porcelain, ready-made clothes, beautiful
skins and furs, bamboo pipes of every size, bamboo ornaments,
pictures, bronzes, specimens of old porcelain, and other
curiosities, to which the Chinese attach great value, attract the
stranger’s notice. Articles of food form the most extensive
trade of all; and it is sometimes a difficult matter to get
through the streets, owing to the immense quantities of fish,
pork, fruit, and vegetables, which crowd the stands in front of
the shops. Dining-rooms, tea-houses, and bakers’ shops, are
met with at every step, from the poor man who carries around
his kitchen or bakehouse, altogether hardly worth a dollar, to
the most extensive tavern or tea-house, crowded with customers.
For a few cash, a Chinese can dine upon rice, fish, vegetables,
and tea; nor does it matter much to him, whether his
table is set in the streets or on the ground, in a house or on a
deck, he makes himself merry with his chopsticks, and eats what
is before him.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The buildings composing the Ching-hwang miao,
and the grounds attached to this establishment, present a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
instance of Chinese style and taste in architecture. Large
warehouses for storing goods, granaries, and temples, are common;
but neither these, nor the public buildings, present any
distinguishing features peculiar to this city alone.</p>

<p>The contrast between the narrow, noisome and reeking parts
of the native city, and the clean, spacious, well-shaded and well-paved
streets and large houses of the foreign municipalities, is
like that seen in many cities in India. The Chinese are ready
enough to enjoy and support the higher style of living, but they
are not yet prepared to adopt and maintain similar improvements
among themselves. The difficulty of being sure of the
co-operation of the rulers in municipal improvements deters intelligent
natives from initiating even the commonest sanitary
enterprise of their foreign neighbors.</p>

<p>The remaining cities and districts of Kiangsu present nothing
worthy of special remark. The Grand Canal runs from north
to south, and affords a safe and ample thoroughfare for multitudes
of boats in its entire length. Tsing-kiang-pu and Hwai-ngan,
near the old Yellow River, receive the traffic from the
north and Hungtsih Lake, while Yangchau near the Yangtsz’
River, takes that going north. In this part of the channel,
constant dyking has resulted in raising the banks; the city of
Hwai-ngan, for example, lies below the canal which brings
trade to its doors, and may one day be drowned by its benefactor.
Salt is manufactured in the districts south of the Yellow
River, where the people cultivate but rare patches of arable
land.</p>

<p>The island of Tsungming, at the mouth of the Yangtsz’, is
about sixty miles long, and sixteen wide, containing over nine
hundred square miles, and is gradually enlarging by the constant
deposits from the river; it is flat, but contains fresh water. It
is highly cultivated and populous, though some places on the
northern side are so impregnated with salt, and others so
marshy, as to be useless for raising food. This island produces
a variety of <i>kaoliang</i> or sorghum (<i>Holcus</i>), which is sweet
enough to furnish syrup, and is grown for that purpose in the
United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POSITION AND TOWNS OF NGANHWUI PROVINCE.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Nganhwui</span> was so named by combining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
first words in its two large cities, Nganking and Hwuichau, and
forms the south-western half of Kiangnan; it is both larger
and more uneven than Kiangsu, ranges of hills stretching along
the southern portions, and between the River Hwai and the
Yangtsz’. It lies in the central and southern parts of the Plain,
north of Kiangsí, west of Kiangsu and Chehkiang, and between
them and Honan and Hupeh. Its productions and manufactures,
the surface, cultivation of the country, and character of
the people, are very similar to those of Kiangsu, but the cities
are less celebrated. The terrible destruction of life in this
province during the Tai-ping rule has only been partially remedied
by immigration from other provinces; it will require
years of peace and industry to restore the prosperous days of
Taokwang’s reign.</p>

<p>The surface of the country is naturally divided into that portion
which lies in the hilly regions around Hwuichau and
Ningkwoh connected with the Tsientang River, the central
plain of the Yangtsz’ with its short affluents, and the northern
portion which the River Hwai drains. The southern districts
are superior for climate, fertility, and value of their products to
most parts of the Empire; and the numerous rivulets which
irrigate and open their beautiful valleys to traffic with other
districts, render them attractive to settlers. No expense has
been spared in erecting and preserving the embankments along
the streams, whose waters are thereby placed at the service of
the farmers.</p>

<p>The Great River passes through the south from south-west
to north-east; several small tributaries flow into it on both
banks, one of which connects with Chau hu, or Nest Lake, in
Luchau fu, the principal sheet of water in the province. The
largest section is drained by the River Hwai and its branches,
which flow into Hungtsih Lake; most of these are navigable
quite across to Honan. The productions comprise every kind
of grain, vegetables, and fruit known in the Plain; most of
the green tea districts lie in the south-eastern parts, particularly
in the Sunglo range of hills in Hwuichau prefecture. Silk,
cotton, and hemp are also extensively raised; but excepting
iron, few metals are brought to market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The provincial capital, Nganking or Anking, lies close to the
northern shore of the Kiang. Davis describes the streets as
very narrow, and the shops as unattractive; the courts and
gateways of many good dwelling-houses presented themselves
as he passed along the streets. “The palace of the governor
we first took for a temple, but were soon undeceived by the inscriptions
on the huge lanterns at the gateway. These official
residences seldom display any magnificence. The pride of a
Chinese officer of rank consists in his power and station, and as
the display of mere wealth attracts little respect, it is neglected
more than in any country of the world. The best shops that
we saw were for the sale of horn lanterns and porcelain. They
possess the art of softening horn by the application of a very
high degree of moist heat, and extending it into thin laminæ of
any shape. These lamps are about as transparent as ground-glass,
and, when ornamented with silken hangings, have an elegant
appearance.” During the fifty years since his visit, this
large city has been the sport of prosperous and adverse fortunes,
and is now slowly recovering from its demolition during the
Tai-ping rebellion. It is situated on rising ground near the base
of a range of hills far in the north, the watershed of two basins.</p>

<p>The banks of the river, between Nanking and Nganking, a
distance of 300 miles, are well cultivated, and contain towns
and villages at short intervals. The climate, the scenery, the
bustle on the river near the towns, and the general aspect of
peaceful thrift along this reach, makes it on ordinary occasions
one of the bright scenes in China. Wuhu hien, about sixty
miles above Nanking, lies near the mouth of the Hwangchi, a
stream connecting it with the back country, and making it the
mart for much of that trade. It was next in importance to
Chinkiang, but its sufferings between the rebels and imperialists
nearly destroyed it. The revival in population and trade has
been encouraging, and its former importance is sure to revive.</p>

<p>Hwuichau (or in Cantonese, Fychow) is celebrated, among
other things, for its excellent ink and lackered-ware. Fungyang
(<i>i.e.</i>, the Rising Phœnix), a town lying north-west of Nanking,
on the River Hwai, was intended, by Hungwu, the founder
of the Ming dynasty, to have been the capital of the Empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
instead of Nanking, and was thus named in anticipation of its
future splendor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KIANGSÍ PROVINCE.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Kiangsí</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, West of the River) lies south
of Nganhwui and Hupeh, between Chehkiang and Fuhkien on
the east, and Hunan on the west, reaching from the Yangtsz’
to the Mei ling on the south. Its form is oblong, and its entire
area is made up of the beautiful basin of the Kan kiang, including
all the affluents and their minor valleys. The hilly portions
form part of the remarkable series of mountainous ridges, which
cover all south-eastern and southern China, an area of about
300,000 square miles, extending from Ningpo south-westerly to
Annam. It is made up of ranges of short and moderate hills,
cut up by a complicated net of water-courses, many of which
present a succession of narrow defiles and gentle valleys with
bottom lands from five to twelve miles wide. That part of this
region in Kiangsí has an irregular watershed on the east, separating
it from the Min basin, and a more definite divide on the
west from Hunan and its higher mountains. The province entire
is a little larger than all New England, or twice the size of
Portugal, but, in population, vastly exceeds those countries.
The surface of the land is rugged, and the character of the
inhabitants partakes in some respects of the roughness of their
native hills. It is well watered and drained by the River Kan
and its tributaries, most of which rise within the province; the
main trunk empties into Poyang Lake by numerous mouths,
whose silt has gradually made the country around it swampy.
For many miles on its eastern and southern banks extends an
almost uninhabitable marsh, presenting a dreary appearance.
The soil, generally, is productive, and large quantities of rice,
wheat, silk, cotton, indigo, tea, and sugar, are grown and exported.
It shares, in some degree, the manufactures of the
neighboring provinces, especially in Nankeen cloth, vast quantities
of which are woven here, but excels them all in the quality
and amount of its porcelain. The mountains produce camphor,
varnish, oak, banian, fir, pine, and other trees; those on the
west are well wooded, but much of the timber has been carried
away during the late rebellion, and left the hillsides bare and
profitless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">TOWNS AND PRODUCTIONS OF KIANGSÍ.</div>

<p>Nanchang, the provincial capital, lies near the southern shore
of the Poyang Lake; the city walls are six miles in circuit, and
accessible by water from all sides. The character of its population
is not favorable among their countrymen, and owing to the
difficulty of reaching it from the Yangtsz’, it escaped the ruin
and rapine which befel Kiukiang. Small steamers can come
up to its jetties, but as the tea and porcelain are shipped on the
south-east side of the lake, Nanchang is not likely to become
a large mart; few of the cities above it can ever be reached by
steamers. Barrow estimated that there were, independent of
innumerable small craft, 100,000 tons of shipping lying before
the place. The banks of the Kan kiang, near the lake, are flat,
and not highly cultivated, but the scenery becomes more varied
and agreeable the further one ascends the stream; towns and
villages constantly come in sight, and the cultivation, though
not universal, is more extended. Among other sights on this
river are the bamboo water-wheels, which are so built on the
steep banksides, that the buckets lift their freight 20 or 25
feet, and pour it out in a ceaseless stream over the fields. The
flumes thrown out into the stream to turn a stronger current on
the wheel, often seriously interfere with navigation. Many
pagodas are seen on either bank of this water-course, some of
them undoubtedly extremely old. As the voyager ascends the
river, several large cities are passed, as Linkiang, Kih-ngan,
Kanchau, and Nan-ngan (all capitals of departments), besides
numerous towns and villages; so that if the extent of this river
and the area of the valley it drains be considered, it will probably
bear comparison with that of any valley in the world for
populousness, amount and variety of productions, and diligence
of cultivation.</p>

<p>Beyond Kihngan are the Shihpah tan, or ‘Eighteen Rapids,’
which are torrents formed by ledges of rocks running across the
river, but not of such height or roughness as to seriously obstruct
the navigation except at low water. The shores in their
vicinage are exceedingly beautiful. The transparency of the
stream, the bold rocks fringed with wood, and the varied forms
of the mountains, call to mind those delightful streams that are
discharged from the lakes and north counties of England. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hilly banks are in many places covered with the Camellia oleifera,
whose white blossoms give them the appearance of snow,
when the plant is in flower. Kanchau is the town where large
boats are obliged to stop; but Nan-ngan is at the head of navigation,
about three hundred miles from the lake, where all goods
for the south are debarked to be carried across the Mei ling, or
‘Plum Pass.’</p>

<p>Within the department of Jauchau in Fauliang hien, east of
Poyang Lake, are the celebrated porcelain manufactories of
Kingteh chin, named after an Emperor of the Sung dynasty,
in whose reign, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1004, they were established. This mart
still supplies all the fine porcelain used in the country, but was
almost wholly destroyed during the rebellion, the kilns broken
up, and the workmen dispersed to join the rebels or die from
want. The million of workmen said to have been employed
there thirty years ago are now only gradually resuming their
operations, and slowly regaining their prosperity. The approach
to the spot is announced by the smoke, and at night it appears
like a town on fire, or a vast furnace emitting flames from
numerous vents, there being, it is said, five hundred kilns constantly
burning. Kingteh chin stands on the river Chang in a
plain flanked by high mountains, about forty miles north-east
from Jauchau, through which its ware is distributed over the
empire.</p>

<p>Genius in China, as elsewhere, renders a place illustrious,
and few spots are more celebrated than the vale of the White
Deer in the Lü hills, near Nankang, on the west side of Lake
Poyang, where Chu Hí, the great commentator of Confucius,
lived and taught, in the twelfth century. It is a secluded valley
about seven miles from the city, situated in a nook by the side
of a rivulet. The unpretending buildings are comprised in a
number of different courts, evidently intended for use rather
than show. In one of the halls, the White Deer is represented,
and near by a tree is pointed out, said to have been planted by
the philosopher’s own hand. This spot is a place of pilgrimage
to Chinese literati at the present day, for his writings are
prized by them next to their classics. The beauty and sublimity
of this region are lauded by Davis, and its praises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
are frequent themes for poetical celebration among native
scholars.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The maritime province of <span class="smcap">Chehkiang</span>, the smallest of the
eighteen, lies eastward of Kiangsí and Nganhwui, and between
Kiangsu and Fuhkein north and south, and derives its
name from the river Cheh or ‘Crooked,’ which runs across its
southern part. Its area is 39,000 square miles, or nearly the
same as Ohio; it lies south-east of the plain at the end of the
Nan shan, and for fertility, numerous water-courses, rich and
populous cities, variety of productions, and excellence of manufactures,
is not at all inferior to the larger provinces. Baron
Richthofen’s letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce,
July 25, 1871, contains a good account of its topography. The
whole province produces cotton, silk, tea, rice, ground nuts,
wheat, indigo, vegetable tallow (<i>stillingia</i>), and pulse, in
abundance. It possesses within its limits every requisite for the
food and clothing of its inhabitants, while the excellence of its
manufactures insures it in exchange a supply of the luxuries
of other regions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATURAL FEATURES OF CHEHKIANG.</div>

<p>The rivers in Chehkiang rise in the province; and, as might
be inferred from the position of the hills, their course is generally
short and the currents rapid. Fourteen principal
streams are enumerated, of which the Tsientang is the most important.
The main branch of this river rises in the southern
districts in two head-waters, which join at Küchau fu and run
thence into Hangchau Bay. The bore which comes up into
this river fifteen miles, as far as Hangchau, is the only one
along the coast. As its wall of water approaches the city, the
junks and boats prepare by turning their bows to meet it, and
usually rise over its crest, 6 or 10 feet at times, without mishap.
The basin of the Tsientang River measures nearly half of the
province; by means of rafts and boats the people transport
themselves and their produce for about 300 miles to its headwaters.
The valley of Lanki is the largest of the bottom lands,
140 miles long and 5 to 15 wide, and passes north through a
gorge 70 miles in length into the lower valley, where it receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the Sin-ngan River from the west in Nganhwui, and thus communicates
with Hwuichau at times of high water. It is just
fitted for the rafting navigation of the region, and by means of
its tortuous channels each one of the 29 districts in its entire
basin can be reached by water.</p>

<p>The forest and fruit trees of Chehkiang comprise almost
every valuable species known in the eastern provinces. The
larch, elcococcus, camphor, tallow, fir, mulberry, varnish, and
others, are common, and prove sources of wealth in their timber
and products. The climate is most salubrious; the grains,
vegetables, animals, and fishes, furnish food; while its beautiful
manufactures of silk are unrivalled in the world, and have found
their way to all lands. Hemp, lackered- and bamboo-wares,
tea, crockery, paper, ink, and other articles, are also exported.</p>

<p>The inhabitants emulate those in the neighboring regions for
wealth, learning, and refinements, with the exception of the
hilly districts in the south bordering on Kiangsí and Fuhkien.
The dwellers of these upland valleys are shut out by position
and inclination, so that they form a singularly clannish race.
Their dialects are peculiar and very limited in range, and each
group of villagers suspects and shuns the others. They are
sometimes rather turbulent, and in some parts the cultivation
of the mountain lands is interdicted, and a line of military
posts extends around them in the three provinces, in order to
prevent the people from settling in their limits; though the interdiction
does not forbid cutting the timber growing there.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HANGCHAU AND ITS ENVIRONS.</div>

<p>Hangchau, the capital of the province, lies in the northern
part, less than a mile from the Tsientang. The velocity of this
stream indicates a rapid descent of the country towards the
ocean, but it discharges very little silt; the tide rises six or seven
feet opposite the city, and nearly thirty at the mouth.</p>

<p>Only a moiety of the inhabitants reside within the walls of
the city, the suburbs and the waters around them supporting a
large population. A portion of the space in the north-western
part is walled off for the accommodation of the Manchu garri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>son,
which consists of 7,000 troops. The governor-general of
Chehkiang and Fuhkien has an official house here, as well, also,
as the governor of the province, but since the increased importance
of Fuhchau, he seldom resides in this city; these, with their
courts and troops, in addition to the great trade passing
through, render it one of the richest and most important cities
in the empire. The position is the most picturesque of
any of the numerous localities selected by the Chinese for their
capital. It lies in full view of the ocean, and from the hill-top
in the centre a wide view of the plains south and east is obtained.
The charming lake, Si Hu, and the numerous houses on
its shores, with the varied scenery of the hills, copses, glades,
and river banks, all highly cultivated, within a radius of ten
miles, fully bear out the praises of the Chinese as to its singular
beauty. Marco Polo lavishes all his admiration upon its size,
riches, manufactures, and government, from which it is to be
inferred that it suffered little in the Mongolian conquest. He
visited the place when governor of Yangchau in 1286, and enthusiastically
describes it as “beyond dispute the finest and the
noblest in the world.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The Chinese have a proverb&mdash;<i>Shang
yu tien tang: Hia yu Su Hang</i>&mdash;the purport of which is that
Hangchau and Suchau are fully equal to paradise; but the
comparison of the Venetian traveller gives one a poorer idea of
the European cities of his day, than it does of the magnificence
of the Chinese, to those who have seen them. The streets are
well-paved, ornamented with numerous honorary tablets erected
to the memory of distinguished individuals, and agreeably interrupting
the passage through them. The long main street
extending along the Grand Canal into and through the city,
thence out by the Tsientang, was, before its ruthless demolition
by the Tai-pings in 1863, probably one of the finest streets in
the whole Empire. The shops and warehouses, in point of size
and stock of goods contained in them, might vie with the best in
London. In population, luxury, wealth, and influence this city
rivals Suchau, and for excellence of manufactures probably
exceeds the latter place. Were Hangchau easily reached by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
sea, and had it ample harbors, it would engross the trade of the
eastern coast; but furious tides (running sometimes 11&frac12; knots
an hour); the bore jeoparding passage-boats and other small
crafts; sand banks and quicksands;&mdash;these present insuperable
difficulties to the commerce by the ocean.</p>

<p>This city was the metropolis of the country during the nine
latter princes of the Sung dynasty (1129 to 1280), when the
northern parts were under dominion of the tribe of Kin Tartars.
One cause of celebrity is found in the beauty of its environs,
especially those near the Si Hu, or West Lake, an irregular sheet
of water about 12 miles in circuit. Barrow observes that “the
natural and artificial beauties of this lake far exceeded anything
we had hitherto had an opportunity of seeing in China. The
mountains surrounding it were lofty, and broken into a variety
of forms that were highly picturesque; and the valleys were
richly clothed with trees of different kinds, among which three
species were remarkably striking, not only by their intrinsic
beauty, but also by the contrast they formed with themselves
and the rest of the trees of the forest. These were the camphor
and tallow trees, and the arbor vitæ. The bright, shining
green foliage of the first, mingled with the purple leaves of the
second, and over-topped by the stately tree of life, of the deepest
green, produced a pleasing effect to the eye; and the landscape
was rendered still more interesting to the mind by the
very singular and diversified appearance of several thousand
repositories of the dead upon the sloping sides of the inferior
hills. Here, as well as elsewhere, the sombre and upright cypress
was destined to be the melancholy companion of the
tombs.</p>

<p>“Higher still, among the woods, avenues had been opened to
admit of rows of small blue houses, exposed on white colonnades,
which, on examination, were also found to be mansions
of the dead. Naked coffins, of extraordinary thickness, were
everywhere lying on the surface of the ground. The margins
of the lake were studded with light aerial buildings, among
which one of more solidity and greater extent than the rest was
said to belong to the emperor. The grounds were inclosed with
brick walls, and mostly planted with vegetables and fruit trees;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
but in some there appeared to be collections of such shrubs and
flowers as are most esteemed in the country.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Staunton speaks of the lake as a beautiful sheet of water,
perfectly pellucid, full of fish, in most places shallow, and ornamented
with a great number of light and fanciful stone bridges,
thrown across the arms of the lake as it runs up into the hills.
A stone tower on the summit of a projecting headland attracted
attention, from its presenting a different architecture from that
usually seen in Chinese buildings. This tower, called the <i>Lui
Fung tah</i>, <i>lit.</i> ‘Tower of the Thunder Peak’ (not Thundering
Wind, as Staunton renders it), from the hill being at first owned
by Mr. Lui, was built about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 950, and is to-day a solid
structure, though much ruined. It has now four stories, and is
about 120 feet high; something like a regular order is still discernible
in the moldering cornices. The legend of the White
Snake is associated with this structure, and people constantly
carry away pieces of its bricks as charms.</p>

<p>An interesting corroboration of this account is given by Polo,
who says, “Inside the city there is a lake which has a compass of
some 30 miles; and all around it are erected beautiful palaces
and mansions, of the richest and most exquisite structure that you
can imagine, belonging to the nobles of the city. There are also
on its shores many abbeys and churches of the idolaters. In the
middle of the lake are two islands, on each of which stands a
rich, beautiful and spacious edifice, furnished in such a style as
to seem fit for the palace of an emperor. And when any one of
the citizens desired to hold a marriage feast, or to give any other
entertainment, it used to be done at one of these palaces.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>


<p>The splendor and size of the numerous Buddhist temples in
and around Hangchau attracted travellers to the city more even
than did its position; these shrines have, however, all been destroyed,
and their thousands of priests driven away; the Tai-pings
left no building untouched. The Yoh Miao stands near
the north-west corner of the Si Hu, and contains the tombs of
the patriot general Yoh Fi of the Sung dynasty (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1125), and
his son, who were unjustly executed as traitors. Two conical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
mounds mark their resting places, and separated by a wall, but
inside the inclosure are four iron statues cast in a kneeling posture
and loaded with chains,&mdash;on his right Tsin Kwei and
his wife, on the left a judge and general, who subserved Tsin
Kwei’s hatred of Yoh Fi by their flagitious conduct. All four
are here doing homage and penance to this just man whom they
killed, and by the obloquy they receive serve as a warning to
other traitors. In a temple, called <i>Ting-tsz’ sz’</i>, not far from
the city, the party of the Dutch embassy were well lodged, and
attended by three hundred priests. The establishment was in
good repair, and besides two guardian monsters more than
thirty feet high, near the entrance, contained five hundred
images of the Buddhist Arhans, with miniature pagodas of
bronze, of beautiful workmanship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DESCRIPTION OF HANGCHAU.</div>

<p>Hangchau is better known abroad for manufactures of silk
than for any other fabrics, but its position at the termination of
the Canal may perhaps give its name to many articles which
are not actually made there, for Huchau is now a greater dépôt
for raw and woven silks. In the northern suburbs lies an irregular
basin, forming the southern extremity of the Canal; but
between the river and the basin there is no communication, so
that all goods brought hither must be landed. The city contains,
among other public buildings, a mosque, bearing an inscription
in Arabic, stating that it is a “temple for Mussulmen,
when travelling, who wish to consult the Koran.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> It is higher
than the adjacent buildings, and adorned with a cupola, pierced
with holes at short intervals. It was spared in 1863, as not being
an idolatrous temple. There are also several others in the
city, it being a stronghold of Islamism in China. Water communication
exists between Hangchau and Yüyau, south-east
through Shauhing, and thence to Ningpo, by means of which
goods find their way to and from the capital. A good road
also runs between the two former cities; indeed, elsewhere in
the province the thoroughfares are very creditable; they are
laid with broad slabs of granite and limestone, and lead over
plains and hills in numberless directions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">NINGPO.</div>

<p>Ningpo fu (‘Peaceful Wave city’) is the next important city
in Chehkiang, in consequence of its foreign relations. It is admirably
situated for trade and influence, at the junction of three
streams, in lat. 29° 55′ N., and long. 121° 22′ E.; the united
river flows on to the ocean, eleven and a half miles distant,
under the name of the Tatsieh. Opposite the city itself, there
are but two streams, but the southern branch again subdivides
a few miles south-west of Ningpo. Its population has been
variously estimated from one-fourth to one-third of a million,
and even more, including the suburban and floating inhabitants.
This place was called <i>King-yuen</i> by the Sung, and received its
present name from the Mongols. It was captured in 1862 by
the insurgents, who were deterred from destroying it by the
presence of foreign men-of-war; the prosperity of the mart has
since increased. When foreigners first resorted to China for
trade, Ningpo soon became a centre of silk and other kinds of
commodities; the Portuguese settled there, calling it <i>Liampo</i>,
which is the same name. It is, moreover, an ancient city, and
its Annals afford full information upon every point interesting
to a Chinese antiquarian, though a foreigner soon tires of the
many insignificant details mixed up with a few valuable statements.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>“The plain in which Ningpo lies is a magnificent amphitheatre,
stretching away from twelve to eighteen miles on one side
to the base of the distant hills, and on the other to the verge of
the ocean. As the eye travels along, it catches many a pleasing
object. Turn landward, it will see canals and water-courses,
fields and snug farm-houses, smiling cottages, family residences,
hamlets and villages, family tombs, monasteries and temples.
Turn in the opposite direction, and you perceive a plain country
descending toward the ocean; but the river alive with all kinds
of boats, and the banks studded with ice-houses, most of all
attract the attention. From without the city, and while still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
upon the ramparts, look within its walls, you will be no less
gratified. Here there is nothing European, little to remind you
of what you have seen in the west. The single-storied and the
double-storied houses, the heavy prison-like family mansions,
the family vaults and graveyards, the glittering roofs of the
temples, the dilapidated official residences, the deserted literary
and examination halls, and the prominent sombre Tower of
Ningpo, are entirely Chinese. The attention is also arrested
for a moment or two by ditches, canals, and reservoirs of water,
with their wooden bridges and stone arches.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Two serious
drawbacks to a residence here are the stifling heat of summer
and the bad quality of the water.</p>

<p>The circumference of the walls is nearly five miles; they are
about twenty-five feet high, fifteen feet wide at the top, and
twenty-two at the base, built solidly, though somewhat dilapidated,
and overgrown with grass. A deep moat partly surrounds
them; commencing at the North gate, it runs on the west, south,
and south-east side as far as Bridge gate, a distance of nearly
three miles, and is in some places forty yards wide. Its constant
use as a thoroughfare for boats insures its repair and proper
depth; the other faces of the city are defended by the river.
There are six gates, and two sally-ports near the south and west
approaches intended for the passage of the boats that ply on the
city canals.</p>

<p>On the east is Bridge gate, within which, and near the walls,
the English factory was once situated. This opening leads out
to the floating bridge; the latter structure is two hundred yards
long and five broad, made of planks firmly lashed, and laid
upon sixteen lighters closely linked and chained together, but
which can be opened. A busy market is held on the bridge,
and the visitor following the lively crowd finds his way to an
extensive suburb on the opposite side. Ferry boats ply across
both streams in vast numbers, adding greatly to the vivacity of
the scene. The custom-house is situated beyond the bridge,
and this eastern suburb contains several buildings of a religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and public character, lumber-yards, dock-yards, and rows of ice-houses,
inviting the notice of the traveller. The environs
beyond the north gate are not so thickly settled as those across
the rivers; the well cultivated fields, divided and irrigated by
numerous water-courses, with scattered hamlets, beguile the
visitor in his rambles, and lead him onward.</p>

<p>There are numerous temples and monasteries, and a large
variety of assembly-halls, governmental offices, and educational
establishments, but none of these edifices are remarkable in an
architectural point of view. The assembly-halls or club-houses
are numerous, and in their internal arrangements form a curious
feature of native society. It is the practice among residents
or merchants from other provinces, to subscribe and erect on
the spot where they are engaged in business, a temple, dedicated
to the patron deity of their native province, in which a
few priests are supported, and plays acted in its honor. Sometimes
the building is put in charge of a layman, called a “master
of ceremonies,” and the current expenses defrayed by subscription.
The club-houses are places of resort for travellers
from the several provinces or districts, and answer, moreover,
to European coffee-houses, in being points where news from
abroad is heard and exchanged.</p>

<p>The streets are well paved, and interrupted here and there
by honorary portals of considerable size and solidity, which also
give variety to an otherwise dull succession of shops and sign-boards,
or dead walls. Two small lagoons afford space for
some aquatic amusements to the citizens. One called Sun Lake
is only a thousand yards in circuit; the other, called Moon
Lake, is near the West gate, and has three times its perimeter.
Both are supplied by sluices passing through the city gates,
while many canals are filled from them, which aid in irrigating
the suburbs. Some of the pleasantest residences of the city are
built on their banks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NINGPO, CHINHAI, AND THE ARCHIPELAGO.</div>

<p>Among interesting edifices is the <i>Tien-fung tah</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, Heaven-conferred
pagoda), a hexagonal seven-storied tower upward of
160 feet high, which, according to the <cite>Annals of Ningpo</cite>, was
first erected 1100 years ago, though during that period it has
been destroyed and rebuilt several times. Upon the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of this work, the tower was constructed before the city itself,
and its preservation is considered as connected with the good
luck of the place. The visitor mounts to the summit by a
flight of narrow stone steps, ascending spirally within the walls.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

<div class="caption"><p>TEMPLE OF THE GODDESS MA TSU-PU, NINGPO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The most elegant and solid building of the city lies on the
water’s edge outside the walls, between the East and Bridge
gates; it is a temple dedicated to the marine goddess Ma Tsupu,
and was founded by Fuhkien men in the 12th century, but
the present structure was erected in 1680, and largely endowed.
Its ornaments are elaborate and rich, and its appearance on festival
days, gay and animated in an unusual degree. The lanterns
and scrolls hanging from the ceiling attract attention by
the curious devices and beautiful characters written and drawn
on them in bright colors, while the walls are concealed by innumerable
drawings.</p>

<p>Chinhai, at the mouth of the river, is so situated by nature
and fortified by art, that it commands the passage. Its environs
were the scene of a severe engagement between the
Chinese and English in October, 1841, on which occasion great
slaughter was committed upon the imperial troops. The town
lies at the foot of a hill on a tongue of land on the northern
bank of the river, and is partly sheltered from the sea on the
north by a dyke about three miles long, composed of large
blocks of hewn granite, and proving an admirable defence in
severe weather. The walls are twenty feet high and three
miles in circumference, but the suburbs extend along the water,
attracted by, and for the convenience of, the shipping. Merchant
ships report here when proceeding up the river, along
whose banks the scenery is diversified, while the water, as usual
in China, presents a lively scene. Numerous ice-houses are
seen constructed of thick stone walls twelve feet high, each
having a door on one side and an incline on the other for the
removal and introduction of the ice, and protected by straw
and a heavily thatched roof.</p>

<p>The Chusan archipelago forms a single district of which
Tinghai is the capital; it is divided into thirty-four <i>chwang</i> or
townships, whose officers are responsible to the district magistrate.
The southern limit of the group is Quesan or the Kiu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
shan islands, in lat. 29° 21′ N., and long. 121° 10′ E., consisting
of eleven islets, the northernmost of which is False Saddle
Island; their total number is over a hundred. Tinghai city
lies on the southern side of Chan shan or Boat Island, which
gives its name on foreign maps to the whole group. It is
twenty miles long, from six to ten wide, and fifty one and a
half in circumference. The archipelago seems to be the highest
portion of a vast submarine plain, geologically connected with the
Nan shan range on the Continent and the mountains in Kiusiu
and Nippon; it is a pivot for the changes in weather and temperature
observed north and south of this point along the coast.</p>

<p>The general aspect of these islands and the mainland, is the
same beautiful alternation of hills and narrow valleys, everywhere
fertile and easily irrigated, with peaks, cascades, and
woodlands interspersed. In Chusan itself the fertile and well-watered
valleys usually reach to the sea, and are furnished with
dykes along the beach, which convert them into plains of
greater or less extent, through which run canals, used both for
irrigation and navigation. Rice and barley, beans, yams, sweet
potatoes, etc., are grown; every spot of arable soil being cultivated,
and terraces constructed on most of the slopes. The
view from the tops of the ridges, looking athwart them, or
adown their valleys, or to seaward, is highly picturesque. The
prevailing rocks belong to the ancient volcanic class, comprising
many varieties, but principally clay-stone, trachyte, and
compact and porphyritic felspar. The brief occupation of this
island by the British forces in 1841 led to no permanent improvement
in the condition of the people, and it has neither
trade nor minerals sufficient to attract capital thither. Owing
in part, perhaps, to this poverty, Tinghai escaped the ravages
of the Tai-pings, and has now recovered from the damage sustained
by its first capture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PUTO ISLAND AND ITS TEMPLES.</div>

<p>Puto and a few smaller islands are independent of civil jurisdiction,
being ruled by the abbot of the head monastery. This
establishment, and that on Golden Island in the Yangtsz’ are
among the richest and best patronized of all the Buddhist
monasteries in China; both of them have been largely favored
by emperors at different periods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Puto is a narrow islet, 3&frac12; miles long, and lies 1&frac12; miles from
the eastern point of Chusan. Its surface is covered with sixty
monasteries, pavilions, temples, and other religious buildings,
besides grottos and sundry monuments of superstition, in which
at least 2,000 idle priests chant the praises of their gods. One
visitor describes his landing and ascending “a broad and well-beaten
pathway which led to the top of one of the hills, at every
crag and turn of which we encountered a temple or a grotto,
an inscription or an image, with here and there a garden tastefully
laid out, and walks lined with aromatic shrubs, which
diffused a grateful fragrance through the air. The prospect
from these heights was extremely delightful; numerous islands,
far and near, bestudded the main, rocks and precipices above
and below, here and there a mountain monastery rearing its
head, and in the valley the great temple, with its yellow tiles
indicative of imperial distinction, basked like a basilisk in the
noonday-sun. All the aid that could be collected from nature
and from Chinese art, was here concentrated to render the
scene enchanting. But to the eye of the Christian philanthropist
it presented a melancholy picture of moral and spiritual
death. The only thing we heard out of the mouths of the
priests was Ometo Fuh; to every observation that was made,
re-echoed Ometo Fuh; and the reply to every inquiry was
Ometo Fuh. Each priest was furnished with a rosary which
he was constantly counting, and as he counted repeated the
same senseless, monotonous exclamation. These characters met
the eye at every turn of the road, at every corner of the temples,
and on every scrap of paper; on the bells, on the gateways,
and on the walls, the same words presented themselves;
indeed the whole island seemed to be under the spell of this
talismanic phrase, and devoted to recording and re-echoing
Ometo Fuh.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The pristine glory of these temples has become
sadly dimmed, many of the buildings present marks of decay,
and some of the priesthood are obliged to resort to honest
labor in order to gain a living. Deaths in their number are
supplied by purchasing youths, who are taught nothing but re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>ligious
literature, a fit training to stunt their minds to pursue
the dull mummery of singing Ometo Fuh. The two imperial
temples present good specimens of Chinese architecture; but
they as well as all other things to be seen at Puto are dilapidated
and effete.</p>

<p>Temples were erected on this island as early as <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 550, and
since it became a resort for priests it seems to have enjoyed the
patronage of the government. The goddess of Mercy is said to
have visited this spot, and her image is the principal object of
worship. No females are allowed to live on the island, nor any
persons other than the priests, unless in their employ. The
revenues are derived from rent of the lands belonging to the
temples, from the collection of those priests who go on begging
excursions over the Empire, and from the alms of pilgrims who
resort to this agreeable locality. It appears like one of the most
beautiful spots on the earth when the traveller lands, just such
a place as his imagination had pictured as exclusively belonging
to the sunny East, and so far as nature and art can combine, it
is really so: but here the illusion ends. Idleness and ignorance,
celibacy and idolatry, vice, dirt, and dilapidation, in the inmates
or in their habitations, form a poor back-ground for the well-dressed
community, and gay, variegated prospect seen when
stepping ashore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHAPU and CANFU.</div>

<p>A town of considerable importance in this province is Chapu,
about fifty miles north-west from Chinhai, across Hangchau
Bay, and connected with that city through a luxuriant plain by
a well-paved causeway about thirty miles long. Chapu was the
port of Hangchau, and when it possessed the entire trade with
Japan, boasted of being the largest mart on the seacoast of Chehkiang.
The town lies at the bottom of a bay on the western
face of some hills forming its eastern point; and at low tide
the mud extends a long way from the lowland. The suburbs
are situated near a small headland; the walled town stands
about half a mile behind. When attacked by the British in
May, 1842, the walls were found in poor condition, but the
Manchu garrison stationed here upheld their ancient reputation
for bravery. This body of troops occupies a separate division
of the city, and their cantonment is planned on the model of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
camp. The outer defences are numerous, but most of the old
fortifications are considerably decayed. The country in the
vicinity is highly cultivated, and possesses an unusual number
of finely constructed, substantial houses.</p>

<p>South-west from Chapu lies the old town of Canfu (called
Kanpu by the Chinese), which was once the port of Hangchau,
but now deserted, since the stream on which it is situated has
become choked with sand. This place is mentioned in the voyages
of two Arabian travellers in the ninth century, as the chief
port of China, where all shipping centred. The narrow entrance
between Buffalo Island and Kitto Point is probably the
Gates of China mentioned by them; and Marco Polo, in 1290,
says, “The Ocean Sea comes within 25 miles of the city at a
place called Ganfu, where there is a town and an excellent
haven, with a vast amount of shipping which is engaged in the
traffic to and from India and other foreign parts.... And a
great river flows from the city of Kinsay to that sea-haven, by
which vessels can come up to the city itself.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Marsden erroneously
supposes Kanpu to be Ningpo. If this was in fact the
<em>only</em> port allowed to be opened for foreign trade, it shows that,
even in the Tang dynasty, the same system of exclusion was
maintained that has so recently been broken up; though at that
date the Emperors in Shansí had very little authority along the
southern coasts. The changes in the Bay of Hangchau have
been more potent causes for the loss of trade, and Yule reasonably
concludes that the upper part of it is believed to cover now
the old site in Polo’s time.</p>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Fuhkien</span> (<i>i.e.</i> Happily Established) is
bounded on the north by Chehkiang, north-west and west by
Kiangsí, south-west by Kwangtung, and east by the channel of
Formosa. Its western borders are determined, for the most
part, by the watershed of the basins of the rivers Min and Kan;
a rugged and fertile region of the Nan shan. The line of sea-coast
is bold, and bordered with a great number of islands,
whose lofty granitic or trappean peaks extend in precipitous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
barren headlands from Namoh as far as the Chusan archipelago.
In the general features of its surface, the islands on its
coasts, and its position with reference to the ocean, it resembles
the region lying east of New Hampshire in the United States;
including Formosa, it about equals Missouri in size.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WATER-COURSES OF FUHKIEN PROVINCE.</div>

<p>The River Min is formed by the union of three large streams
at Yenping fu; it drains all the country lying east of the Wu-í
(Bohea) hills, or about three-fourths of the province. It is
more than three hundred miles long, and owing to its regular
depth, is one of the most useful streams in China; twenty-seven
walled towns stand on its banks. The tide rises eighteen or
twenty feet at the entrance, and this, with the many islands and
reefs, renders the approach difficult. At Min-ngan hien, about
fourteen miles from the mouth, the stream is contracted to less
than half a mile for about three miles, the water being from
twelve to twenty-five fathoms deep; the hills on each side rise
from fifteen hundred to two thousand feet. One traveller speaks
of the walls of its forts and batteries, in this part, as affording
a sort of stairs for the more convenient ascent of the hills on
which they are situated. From the top, “the view embraces a
beautiful scene; nothing can be more picturesque than the little
plats of wheat and barley intermixing their yellow crops on the
acclivities with bristling pines and arid rocks, and crowned with
garden spots, or surrounded with rice fields and orchards of
oranges. The valley of the Min, viewed from the summit of
the fortress, is truly a beautiful sight.”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The scenery on this
river, though of a different character, will bear comparison with
that of the Hudson for sublimity and beauty; the hills are,
however, much higher, and the country less fruitful, on the
Min.</p>

<p>Beyond Pagoda Anchorage the passage is too shallow for
large vessels, and this obstacle tends to prevent Fuhchau from
becoming a place of commerce in keeping with its size and
geographical advantages. From the city upwards the river is
partially obstructed with rocks and banks, rendering the navigation
troublesome as far as Mintsing hien, about thirty miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
above it, beyond which the strong rapids render the passage
to Yenping extremely tedious,&mdash;in high water impossible even
with trackers. The banks are steep, and the tow-rope is sometimes
taken 50 to 70 feet above the water.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens says of this river, that “bold, high, and romantic
hills give a uniform yet ever varying aspect to the country;
but it partakes so much of the mountainous character, that it
may be truly said that beyond the capital we saw not one plain
even of small extent. Every hill was covered with verdure
from the base to the summit. The less rugged were laid out in
terraces, rising above each other sometimes to the number of
thirty or forty. On these the yellow barley and wheat were
waving over our heads. Here and there a laborer, with a bundle
of grain which he had reaped, was bringing it down on his
shoulder to thrash out. Orange, lemon, and mulberry, or other
trees, sometimes shaded a narrow strip along the banks, half
concealing the cottages of the inhabitants.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Next in size is the Lung kiang, which flows by Changchau,
and disembogues near Amoy after a course of two hundred
miles. A large number of small islands lie on the coast of
Fuhkien, the first of which, on the west, is Namoh or Nan-au,
about thirteen miles long. Amoy and Quemoy are the largest
islands of a group lying off the estuary of the Lung kiang.
Chimmo Bay is north-east of Amoy, and is the entrance of the
passage up to Chinchew, or Tsiuenchau fu, the <i>Zayton</i><a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> of
Marco Polo, and still celebrated for the commercial enterprise
of its inhabitants. Before the introduction of steamers into the
coasting trade, the harbors and creeks along the provinces of
Fuhkien and Kwangtung were infested with numerous fleets of
pirates, which used to “sneak about like rats,” and prey upon
the peaceful traders.</p>

<p>The grain raised in Fuhkien is hardly enough to support its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
population, especially on the sea-board, and large quantities of
rice are brought from Siam, Formosa, and elsewhere. Black
tea, camphor and other woods, sugar, chinaware, and grass-cloth,
are the principal exports.</p>

<div class="sidenote">APPEARANCE OF FUHCHAU.</div>

<p>The city of Fuhchau (<i>i.e.</i>, Happy City), or Hokchiu, as it is
called by the inhabitants, lies in lat. 26° 5′ north, and long. 119°
20′ east, on the northern side of the Min, thirty-four miles from
its mouth, and nine from Pagoda Island. The city lies in a
plain, surrounded by hills, forming a natural and most magnificent
amphitheatre of vast dimensions, whose fertility emulates
and adds to its beauty. Suburbs extend from the walls three
miles to the banks, and stretch along on both sides the stream.
They are connected with each other, and a small islet in the
river, by a stone bridge built in the eleventh century. The
scenery is bold, and such parts of the surrounding hills as are not
cultivated or used for graves, are covered with pines; some of
the hills north of the city are three thousand feet high. Opposite
Fuhchau the land is lower, and the suburb is built upon an
island formed by the division of the main channel, seven miles
above the city; the branches reunite at Pagoda Island. This
island, and the plain on each side, forms a large basin, about
twenty miles long by fifteen wide. The river is crowded with
floating habitations, ferry-boats, and trading craft, rendering its
surface an animated and noisy scene. The flowers grown in
pots on the boats, and those usually worn by the boatwomen in
their hair, all assist in imparting a pleasing aspect to the lively
sight.</p>

<p>The city walls are about thirty feet high and twelve wide at
the top. The gates, seven in number, are overlooked by high
towers; smaller guard-houses stand upon the walls at short intervals,
in which a few soldiers lodge, and where two or three
cannon indicate their object. The city is divided into wards
and neighborhoods, each of which is under its own police and
headmen, who are responsible for the peace of their respective
districts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUILDINGS AND TYPES OF INHABITANTS.</div>

<p>From the Wu-shih shan, an eminence on the south of the city,
the view is extensive, and presents a great diversity of charming
objects. The square battlements of the wall are seen ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>tending
in a devious and irregular circuit for more than eight
miles, and inclosing most of the buildings, except on the south.
On the south-east, a hill rises abruptly more than two hundred
feet, its sides built up with interspersed dwellings; and another
on the extreme north of the city, surmounted by a watch-tower,
closes the prospect in that direction. Two pagodas within, and
fantastic looking watch-towers upon the walls, large, regular-built
granaries, and a vast number of flag-staffs in pairs indicating
temples and offices, contribute to relieve the otherwise dull
monotony, which is still further diversified by many large trees.
Several lookout houses are placed over the streets, or upon the
roofs of buildings, for the accommodation of watchmen, one of
which immediately attracts the attention of the visitor, from
its height, and its clock-dial with Roman letters. Few vacant
spaces occur within the walls of the city, which is everywhere
equally well built.</p>

<p>Serpentine canals divide the country round about into plats
of greater or less extent, of every form and hue; while they
help drain the city and provide channels for boats coming from
the river. These parts of the landscape are dotted with hamlets
and cottages, or, where the ground is higher, with graves
and tombstones. To one seated on this eminence, the confused
hum of mingling cries ascending from the town below,&mdash;the
beating of gongs, crackling of fireworks, reports of guns,
vociferous cries of hucksters and coolies, combining with the
barking of dogs and other domestic sounds, as well as those
from the crows, fish-hawks, and magpies nearer by,&mdash;inform
him in the liveliest manner that the beautiful panorama he is
looking down upon is filled with teeming multitudes in all the
tide of life. On the western side of the city is a sheet of water,
called Si Hu, or West Lake, with a series of unpretending buildings
and temples lying along its margin, a bridge crossing its expanse,
and fishing-nets and boats floating upon its bosom. The
watch-tower, on the hill in the northern part of the city, is
upon the wall, which here runs near a precipice two hundred
feet high; it is a most conspicuous object when approaching
the place.</p>

<p>The Manchus occupy the eastern side of the city, and num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>ber
altogether about 8,000 persons; the natives generally are
not allowed to enter their precincts. They live under their own
officers, in much the same style as the Chinese, and, not having
any regular occupation, give no little trouble to the provincial
authorities. Though vastly larger than Ningpo, the number
of temples and substantial private residences in Fuhchau is much
less, and as a whole it is not so well built. The streets are full
of abominations, for which the people seem to care very little.
Before foreign trade attained importance, paper money used to
be issued by native mercantile firms in the city, varying in denomination
from forty cents to a thousand dollars, and supplying
all the advantages with few of the dangers of bank notes.
The blue, red, and black colors, which are blended on these
promissory bills, present a gay appearance of signatures and
endorsings. The name of the issuing house, and a number of
characters traced around the page, in bright blue ink, form the
original impression. The date of issue, and some ingeniously
wrought cyphers, for the reception of signatures and prevention
of forgeries, are of a deep red; while the entry of the sum, and
names of the partners and receiver, stand forth in large black
characters. On the back are the endorsements of various individuals,
through whose hands the bill has passed, in order to
facilitate the detection of forgeries, but not rendering the writer
at all liable. These bills have now nearly disappeared, and
bank bills from Hongkong are gradually coming into use. The
streets usually are thronged with craftsmen and hucksters, in the
fashion of Chinese towns, where the shopmen, in their desire
to attract buyers, seem to imagine, that the more they get in
their customers’ way, the more likely they are to sell them
something. The shops are thrown open so widely, and display
such a variety of articles, or expose the workmen so plainly,
that the whole street seems to be rather the stalls of a market,
or the aisle in a manufactory, than the town-thoroughfare.</p>

<p>The chief civil and military dignitaries of the province reside
here, besides the prefect and the magistrates of Min and
Haukwan districts. The <i>Ching-hwang miao</i> is one of the
largest religious edifices in the place, and the temples of the
goddess of Mercy, and god of War, the most frequented. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<i>Kiu Sien shan</i>, or ‘Hill of the Nine Genii,’ on the southern side
of the town, is a pretty object. The city wall runs over it,
and on its sides little houses are built upon rocky steps; numerous
inscriptions are carved in the face of the rocks. Near the
eastern gate, called <i>Tang măn</i>, or ‘Bath gate,’ is a small suburb,
where Chinese and Manchus live together, and take care of
many hot wells filled from springs near by; the populace resort
hither in large crowds to wash and amuse themselves.</p>

<p>The citizens of Fuhchau bear the character of a reserved,
proud, rather turbulent people, unlike the polite, affable natives
further north. They are better educated, however, and plume
themselves on never having been conquered by foreigners.
Their dialect is harsh, contrasting strongly with the nasal tones
of the patois of Amoy, and the mellifluous sounds heard at
Ningpo. There are few manufactures of importance in the
city, its commerce and resources depending almost wholly on
the trade with the interior by the River Min. Many culprits
wearing the cangue are to be seen in the streets, and in passing
none of the hilarious merriment which is heard elsewhere greets
the ear. There is also a general lack of courtesy between acquaintances
meeting in the highway, a circumstance quite unusual
in China. Beggars crowd the thoroughfares, showing both
the poverty and the callousness of the inhabitants. One half the
male population is supposed to be addicted to the opium pipe,
and annually expend millions of dollars for this noxious gratification.
The population of the city and suburbs is reckoned
at rather over than under a million souls, including the boat
people; it is, no doubt, one of the chief cities in the Empire in
size, trade, and influence.</p>

<p>The island in the river is settled by a trading population, a
great part of whom consist of sailors and boatmen. The country
women, who bring vegetables and poultry to market, are a
robust race, and contrast strikingly with the sickly-looking,
little-footed ladies of the city. Fishing-boats are numerous in
the river, many of which are furnished with cormorants.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">AMOY AND ITS ENVIRONS.</div>

<p>Amoy is the best known port in the province, and 150 years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
ago was the seat of a large foreign commerce. It lies in the
district of Tung-ngan, within the prefecture of Tsiuenchau, in
lat. 24° 40′ N., and long. 118° 20′ E., upon the south-western
corner of the island of Amoy, at the mouth of the Lung Kiang.
The island itself is about forty miles in circumference, and contains
scores of large villages besides the city. The scenery
within the bay is picturesque, caused partly by the numerous
islands which define it, some of them surmounted by pagodas
or temples, and partly by the high hills behind the city, and
crowds of vessels in the harbor in the foreground.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> There is
an outer and inner city, as one approaches it seaward&mdash;or more
properly a citadel and a city&mdash;divided by a ridge of rocky hills
having a fortified wall along the top. A paved road connects
the two, which is concealed from the view of the beholder as
he comes in from sea, until he has entered the Inner harbor.
The entire circuit of the city and suburbs is about eight miles,
containing a population of 185,000, while that of the island is
estimated at 100,000 more.</p>

<p>The harbor of Amoy is one of the best on the coast; the tide
rises and falls from fourteen to sixteen feet. The western side
of the harbor is formed by the island of Kulang su, the batteries
upon it completely commanding the city. It is about a
mile long and two and three-quarters around, and maintains a
large rural population, scattered among four or five hamlets.
The foreign residences scattered over its hills add measurably
to the charm of its aspect when viewed from the harbor. Eastward
of Amoy is the island of Quemoy (<i>i.e.</i>, Golden harbor),
whose low, rice grounds on the south-west shore produce a
very different effect as opposed to the high land on Amoy; its
population is, moreover, much less.</p>

<p>The country in this part of Fuhkien is thickly settled and
highly cultivated. Mr. Abeel, describing a trip toward Tung-ngan,
says, “For a few miles up, the hills wore the same
rugged, barren aspect which is so common on the southern
coast of China, but fertility and cultivation grew upon us as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
advanced; the mountains on the east became hills, and these
were adorned with fields. The villages were numerous at intervals;
many of them were indicated in the distance by large
groves of trees, but generally the landscape looked naked.
Well-sweeps were scattered over the cultivated hills, affording
evidence of the need and the means of irrigation.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>In the other direction, toward Changchau, the traveller, beyond
Pagoda Island, enters an oval bay ten or twelve miles
long, bounded by numerous plains rising in the distance into
steep barren mountains, and upon which numerous villages are
found; twenty-three were counted at once by Mr. Abeel, and
the boatmen said that all could not be seen. Several large
towns, and “villages uncounted” are visible in every direction,
as one proceeds up the river toward Changchau, thirty-five
miles from Amoy. This city is well built, the streets paved
with granite, some of them twelve feet wide, and intolerably
offensive. A bridge, about eight hundred feet long, spans the
river, consisting of beams stretching from one abutment to another,
covered with cross pieces. From the hill-top behind a
temple at the north-western corner of the city, the prospect is
charming.</p>

<p>“Imagine an amphitheatre,” says Mr. Lowrie, “thirty miles
in length and twenty in breadth, hemmed in on all sides by
bare pointed hills, a river running through it, an immense city
at our feet, with fields of rice and sugar-cane, noble trees and
numerous villages stretching away in every direction. It was
grand and beautiful beyond every conception we had ever
formed of Chinese scenery. Beneath us lay the city, its shape
nearly square, curving a little on the river’s banks, closely built,
and having an amazing number of very large trees within and
around. The guide said that in the last dynasty it had numbered
700,000 inhabitants, and now he thought it contained a
million&mdash;probably a large allowance. The villages around also
attracted our attention. I tried to enumerate them, but after
counting thirty-nine of large size distinctly visible in less than
half the field before us, I gave over the attempt. It is cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>tainly
within the mark to say that within the circuit of this
immense plain there are at least one hundred villages, some of
them small, but many numbering hundreds and even thousands
of inhabitants.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Changchau was the last city in the eastern provinces held by
the Tai-pings, a small remnant of their forces having come
across the country after the loss of Nanking. They were expelled
in 1866, after the town had suffered much from the contending
forces. Traces of this destruction have not yet entirely
disappeared from the vicinity.</p>

<p>Shihma, or Chiohbé, is a place of some trade, extending a
mile along the shore, and larger than Haitang hien, a district
town between it and Amoy. Large numbers of people dwell
in boats on this river, rendering a voyage up its channel somewhat
like going through a street, for the noise and bustle.</p>

<p>The city of Chinchew (or Tsiuenchau), north of Amoy, was
once the larger of the two. It is described by Marco Polo, who
reached it after five days’ journey from Fuhchau, meeting with
a constant succession of flourishing cities, towns and villages.
“At this city is the haven of Zayton, frequented by all the
ships from India, ... and by all the merchants of Manzi, for
hither is imported the most astonishing quantity of goods and
of precious stones and pearls.... For it is one of the two
greatest havens in the world for commerce.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> It was gradually
forsaken for Amoy, which was more accessible to junks.
From Zayton, Kublai Khan’s expedition to Java and Japan
sailed, and here the men from Egypt and Arabia traded for
silks, sugar, and spices long after the Portuguese reached China.</p>

<p>The department of Hinghwa, situate on the coast between
Tsiuenchau and Fuhchau, is exceedingly populous, and its dialect
differs distinctly from both of the adjoining prefectures.
Its people have a bad reputation, and female infanticide prevails
here to a greater degree than elsewhere. At Yenping, on
the Min River, the people speak the dialect of Nanking, showing
their origin of not many scores of years past; there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
many patois in these hilly parts of Fuhkien, and the province
as a whole exhibits probably greater discrepancies in its dialects
than any other. Its produce is exported north and west, as
well as coastwise, and this intercourse tends to assimilate the
speech of the inhabitants with their neighbors. The natural
scenery in the ranges near the Bohea Hills in the borders of
Kiangsí attracts visitors from afar. Fortune describes the picturesque
grouping of steep rocks, lonely temples on jutting
ledges and hidden adits, alternating with hamlets, along the
banks of the stream which carries the boats and produce away
to a market. The rocks and cliffs here have furnished Chinese
artists with many subjects for pen and pencil, while the valley
in addition to its natural beauty brings forth the best of teas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ISLAND OF FORMOSA.</div>

<p>The island of Formosa, lying 90 miles west of Amoy, together
with the Pescadore group, forms a department called
Taiwan. The former is a fertile, well-watered region, possessing
a salubrious climate, and meriting in every respect its name
<i>Formosa</i>&mdash;a descriptive term first given by the Portuguese to
their settlement at Kilung in 1590, and extended afterward to
the entire island. Its total length is about 235 miles, while the
width at the centre is not far from 80 miles; the limits of
Chinese jurisdiction do not, however, embrace more than the
western or level portion, leaving to untamed aborigines the
thickly wooded districts beyond the <i>Muh kan shan</i>, a lofty
range of mountains running north and south and forming the
backbone of the island. The western coast presents no good
harbors, and vessels lying a long distance off shore are exposed
to the double inconvenience of a dangerous anchorage and an
inhospitable reception from the natives; the eastern side is still
less inviting, owing to its possession by savage tribes. From
recent reports it appears, moreover, that the whole coast line is
rising with unusual persistence and regularity, and that the
streams are being choked up at their mouths.</p>

<p>The aborigines of this island are, in those districts that remain
uncontaminated by mixture with Chinese settlers, a remarkably
well-built, handsome race, strong, large of eye, bold,
and devoted to hunting and ardent spirits (when the latter is
procurable), after the manner of wild people the world over;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
no written language exists among them, nor do they employ
any fixed method of reckoning time. They and the inhabitants
of Lewchew and neighboring islands are probably of the
same race with the Philippine Tagalas, though some have supposed
them to be of Malay or Polynesian origin. Like the
North American Indians they are divided into numerous clans,
whose mutual feuds are likely to last until one party or another
is exterminated; this turbulence restrains them from any
united action against the Chinese, whose occupation of the
island has always been irksome to the natives. Their social
condition is extremely low; though free from the petty vices
of thieving and deception, and friendly toward strangers, the
principle of blood-requital holds among them with full force,
and family revenge is usually the sole object of life among the
men. No savage is esteemed who has not beheaded a Chinaman,
while the greater the number of heads brought home
from a fray, the higher the position of a brave in the community.
The women are forced to attend both to house and
field, but share the laziness of their masters, insomuch that
they never cut from the growing rice or millet more than
enough for the day’s provision. “Although these people have
men’s forms,” observes a Chinese writer in the peculiar antithetical
style common to their literary productions, “they have
not men’s natures. To govern them is impossible; to exterminate
them not to be thought of; and so nothing can be done
with them. The only thing left is to establish troops with
cannon at all the passes through which they issue on their raids,
and so overawe them, by military display, from coming out
of their fastnesses. The savage tracks lie only through the
dense forests, thick with underbrush, where hiding is easy.
When they cut off a head, they boil it to separate the flesh,
adorn the skull with various ornaments, and hang it up in
their huts as evidence of their valor.” In addition to a few
native clans who have submitted to the rulers from the mainland
and dwell in the border region between the colonists and
aborigines proper, a peculiarly situated race, called <i>Hakkas</i>,
maintains a neutral position between the hill tribes and the
Chinese. These people were formerly industrious but per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>secuted
inhabitants of Kwangtung province, who, in order to
better their lot, emigrated to Formosa and established close
communication with the natives there, making themselves indispensable
to them by procuring arms, powder, and manufactured
goods, while owing to their industry they were able in
time to monopolize the camphor trade. Though retaining the
Chinese costume and shaving their heads, they practically ignore
Chinese rule, paying tribute and intermarrying with the mountaineers,
from whom they have also obtained large tracts of land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRODUCTIONS OF FORMOSA.</div>

<p>Maize, potatoes, fruits, tobacco, indigo, sugar, rice, and tea,
are all grown on this island, the three latter in rapidly increasing
quantities for purposes of export. Of natural products salt,
coal, sulphur, petroleum, and camphor are of the first importance.
The vast coal basins have hardly been opened or even
explored, the only mines now worked being those in the
northern part, near Kilung. Native methods of mining are,
however, the only ones employed thus far, and it is not surprising,
considering their extreme simplicity, that they have not
been able to extract coal from remote districts, where the
natural difficulties encountered are greatest. Hand labor alone
is used, and draining a pit unheard of&mdash;compelling a speedy
abandoning of the mines when pierced to any great depth in
the mountain side. The cost of the coal at the mouth of the
pit is about 65 cents per ton for the first qualities, which price
improved methods might reduce a third. The presence of
volcanoes on this island will, nevertheless, present a serious
obstacle to the employment of western mining machinery,
especially along the coast, where the measures appear to be excessively
dislocated and the work of draining is rendered more
difficult. Petroleum is abundant in certain tracts of northern
Formosa, flowing plentifully from crevices in the hills, and
used to some extent for burning and medicinal purposes by the
natives, but not exported. The possibilities of a large sulphur
trade are much more important. It is brought from solfatarae
and geysers at Tah-yu kang, near Kilung, where it is found in
a nearly pure state, as well, too, as a great quantity of sulphurous
acid which might with profit be used in the sugar refineries
on the island. The manufacture of sulphur is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
forbidden by treaty, though its exportation goes on in small
quantities, the contractors taking on themselves all risk of
seizure. Camphor, perhaps the greatest source of wealth to
Formosa, is obtained here by saturating small sticks of the
wood with steam, not by boiling as in Japan. The crystals of
camphor condense in a receiver placed above the furnace; during
the process of distillation an essential oil is produced, which
when chemically treated with nitric acid becomes solid camphor.
The trees from which the wood is cut grow in the most inaccessible
tracts of the island, and are, according to all descriptions, of
immense extent, though chopped down by the natives without
discrimination or idea of encouraging a second growth.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting natural phenomena of this district
are the so-called volcanoes, whose occasional eruptions
have been noticed by many. Mr. Le Gendre, United States
Consul at Amoy in 1869, upon a visit to Formosa took occasion
to examine more closely into this subject. It appears from his
report<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> that a gas is constantly issuing from the earth, and when
a hole to the depth of a few inches is made it can be lighted.
It is most likely, he continues, that from time to time gas jets
break forth at points of the hills where they had not been observed
before, rushing through its long grass and forests of
huge trees, and the rock oil which as a general thing flows in
their vicinity. As they are apt to spontaneously ignite in contact
with the atmosphere, they must set fire to these materials
and cause a local conflagration, that gives to the many peaks of
the chain the appearance of volcanoes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORMOSA AND THE PESCADORES.</div>

<p>Previous to the first half of the fifteenth century the Chinese
had little knowledge of Formosa, nor was their sway established
over any part of it until 1683. It was never really colonized,
and became a misgoverned and refractory region from
the earliest attempts at subjection. A great emigration is constantly
going on from the main, and lands are taken up by
capitalists, who not only encourage the people in settling there,
but actually purchase large numbers of poor people to occupy
these districts. Taiwan fu, the seat of local government, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
largest place on the island; other harbors or places of importance
are Ku-sia and Takow, some miles south of Taiwan, the
latter, with Tamsui, on the north-west coast, being one of the
recently opened ports of trade. Kílung possesses a good harbor
and is the entrepôt of goods for the northern end of the
island. Since the opening (in 1861) of these three towns to foreign
intercourse, and the more careful examination of the neutral
territory at the foot of the mountains, the resources, peoples, and
condition of this productive isle have become better known.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to refer, before leaving Formosa, to the
extraordinary fabulous history of the island by one George
Psalmanazar, the <i>nom de plume</i> of a remarkable impostor of the
commencement of the eighteenth century, who pretended to be
a Japanese convert to Christianity from Formosa, and who created
a profound sensation in Europe by the publication in
Latin of a fictitious notice of that country.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>About twenty-five miles west of Formosa, and attached to
Taiwan fu, is the district of <i>Pănghu ting</i> or Pescadore Islands,
consisting of a group of twenty-one inhabited islets, the largest
of which, called Pănghu, is eighty-four miles in circumference;
none of them rise three hundred feet above the sea. The two
largest, called Pănghu and Fisher Islands, are situated near the
centre of the cluster, and have an excellent harbor between
them. The want of trees, and the absence of sheltered valleys,
give these islands a barren appearance. Millet, ground-nuts,
pine-apples, sweet potatoes, and vegetables are grown, but for
most of their supplies they depend upon Formosa. The population
of the group is estimated at 8000, of whom a large part
are fishermen. The Dutch seized these islands in 1622, and
attempted to fortify them by forced Chinese laborers, but removed
to Formosa two years after at the instance of the governor
of Fuhkien.</p>

<span class="smaller">GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE WESTERN PROVINCES.</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">THE PROVINCE OF HUPEH.</div>

<p>The central provinces of Hupeh and Hunan formerly constituted
a single one under the name of Hukwang (<i>i.e.</i> Broad
Lakes), and they are still commonly known by this appellation.
<span class="smcap">Hupeh</span> (<i>i.e.</i> North of the Lakes) is the smaller of the two, but
contains the most arable land. It is bounded north by Honan,
east by Nganhwui and Kiangsí, south by Hunan, and west by
Sz’chuen and Shensí. Its area is about 70,000 square miles, or
slightly above that of New England.</p>

<p>The Great River flows through the south, where it connects
with all the lakes on both its shores, and nearly doubles its
volume of water. The Han kiang, or Han shui rises in the
southwest of Shensí, between the Fuh-niu shan and Tapa ling,
and drains the south of that province and nearly the whole of
Hupeh, joining the Yangtsz’ at Wuchang. It is very tortuous
in its course, flowing about 1,300 miles in all, and is navigable
only a portion of the year, during the freshes, as far as Siangyang,
about 300 miles. Boats of small size come down, however,
at all times from Sin-pu-wan, near its source in Shensí.
The mouth is not over 200 feet broad, but the bed of the river
as one ascends soon widens to 400 and 500 feet, and at Shayang,
168 miles from Hankow, it is half a mile wide. The
area of its whole basin is about the same as the province.</p>

<p>The extraordinary effects of a large body of melted snow
poured into a number of streams converging on the slopes of a
range of hills, and then centring in a narrow valley, bringing
their annual deposit of alluvial and silt are seen along the River
Han. The rise of this stream is often fifty feet where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
narrowest, and the shores are high; at Íching the channel
varies from 300 to 1,500 feet at different seasons, but the river-bed
from 2,000 to 9,000 feet, the water rising 18 feet at the
fresh. In these wide places, the river presents the aspect of a
broad, winding belt of sand dunes, in which the stream meanders
in one or many channels. Navigation, therefore, is difficult
and dangerous, since moving sands shift the deep water
from place to place, and boats are delayed or run aground. In
high water the banks are covered, but the current is then
almost as serious an obstacle as the shallows are in winter.</p>

<p>The southeastern part of Hupeh is occupied by an extensive
depression filled with a succession of lakes. The length and
breadth of this plain are not far from two hundred miles, and
it is considered the most fertile part of China, not being subject
to overflows like the shores of the Yellow River, while the
descent of the land allows its abundance of water to be readily
distributed. Every spot is cultivated, and the surplus of productions
is easily transported wherever there is a demand.
The portions nearest the Yangtsz’ are too low for constant cultivation.</p>

<p>The Ax Lake, Millet Lake, Red Horse Lake, and Mienyang
Lake, are the largest in the province. The remaining parts of
both the Lake provinces are hilly and mountainous; the high
range of the Ta-peh shan (‘Great White Mountains’), commencing
far into Shensí, extends to the west of Hupeh, and separates
the basins of the Great River from its tributary, the Han
kiang, some of its peaks rising to the snow line. The productions
of Hupeh are bread-stuffs, silk, cotton, tea, fish, and timber;
its manufactures are paper, wax, and cloth. The climate
is temperate and healthy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WUCHANG AND HANKOW.</div>

<p>The favorable situation of Wuchang, the provincial capital,
has drawn to it most of the trade, which has caused in the
course of years the settlement of Hanyang and Hankow on the
northern bank of the Yangtsz’ and River Han. The number
of vessels gathered here in former years from the other cities
on these two streams was enormous, and gave rise to exaggerated
ideas of the value of the trade. The introduction of
steamers has destroyed much of this native commerce, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
cities themselves suffered dreadfully by the Tai-pings, from
which they are rapidly recovering, and on a surer foundation.
The cities lie in lat. 30° 33′ N. and long. 114° 20′ E., 582 geographical
miles distant from Shanghai.</p>

<p>Wuchang is the residence of the provincial officers, the
Manchu garrison, and a literary population of influence, while
the working part depends mostly on Hankow for employment.
Its walls are over twelve miles in circuit, inclosing more vacant
than occupied surface, whose flatness is relieved by a range of
low hills that extend beyond Hanyang on the other side of
the river. The narrow streets are noisome from the offal,
and in summer are sources of malaria, as the drainage is
bad.</p>

<p>When Hankow was opened to foreign trade in 1861, it presented
a most ruinous appearance, but the sense of security inspired
by the presence of the men and vessels from far lands
rapidly drew the scattered citizens and artisans to rebuild the
ruins. The foreigners live near the river side, east of Hankow
and west of the River Han, where the anchorage is very favorable,
and out of the powerful current of the Yangtsz’. The
difference in level of the great stream is about forty feet in the
year. In the long years of its early and peaceful trade up to
1850, this region had gathered probably more people on a given
area than could be found elsewhere in the world; and its repute
for riches led foreigners to base great hopes on their share,
which have been gradually dissipated. The appearance of the
city as it was in 1845 is given by Abbé Huc in a few sentences:</p>

<p>“The night had already closed in when we reached the place
where the river is entirely covered with vessels, of every size and
form, congregated here from all parts. I hardly think there
is another port in the world so frequented as this, which passes,
too, as among the most commercial in the empire. We entered
one of the open ways, a sort of a street having each side defined
by floating shops, and after four hours’ toilsome navigation
through this difficult labyrinth, arrived at the place of debarkation.
For the space of five leagues, one can only see houses
along the shore, and an infinitude of beautiful and strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
looking vessels in the river, some at anchor and others passing
up and down at all hours.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The coup d’œil of these three cities is beautiful, their environs
being highly cultivated and interspersed with the mansions
of the great; but he adds, “If you draw near, you will find on
the margin of the river only a shapeless bank worn away with
freshets, and in the streets stalls surmounted with palisades, and
workshops undermined by the waters or tumbling to pieces
from age. The open spots between these ruins are filled with
abominations which diffuse around a suffocating odor. No
regulations respecting the location of the dwellings, no sidewalks,
no place to avoid the crowd which presses upon one,
elbowing and disputing the passage, but all get along pell-mell,
in the midst of cattle, hogs, and other domestic animals, each
protecting himself as he best can from the filth in his way,
which the Chinese collect with care for agricultural uses, and
carry along in little open buckets through the crowd.”</p>

<p>Above Hankow, the towns on the Yangtsz’ lie nearer its
banks, as they are not so exposed to the freshets. The largest
trading places in this part of Hupeh on the river, are Shasí,
opposite Kinchau fu, and Íchang near the borders of Sz’chuen,
respectively 293 and 363 miles distance. From the first settlement
there is a safe passage by canal across to Shayang, forty
miles away on the River Han; the travel thence goes north
to Shansí. The other has recently been opened to foreign
trade. It is the terminus of navigation for the large vessels
used from Shanghai upward, as the rapids commence a few
miles beyond, necessitating smaller craft that can be hauled by
trackers. These two marts are large centres of trade and travel,
and were not made desolate by the Tai-pings, as were all other
towns of importance on the lower Yangtsz’.</p>

<p>The portion of the Yangtsz’ in this province, between Íchang
and the Sz’chuen border, exhibits perhaps some of the most
magnificent glimpses of scenery in the world. Breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
through the limestone foundations that dip on either side of
the granite core of the rapids, the river first penetrates the
Wu shan, Mitan, and Lukan gorges on the one side, then the
long defile of Íchang on the other. At various points between
and beyond these the stream is broken by more or less formidable
rapids. Among these grand ravines the most impressive,
though not the longest, is that of Lukan, whose vertical
walls rise a thousand feet or more above the narrow river.
Nothing can be more striking, observes Blakiston, than suddenly
coming upon this huge split in the mountain mass “by
which the river escapes as through a funnel.”</p>

<p>The eastern portions of Hupeh are rougher than the southern,
and were overrun during the rebellion by armed bands, so
that their best towns were destroyed. Siangyang fu and Fanching,
near the northern borders, are important places in the
internal commerce of this region. Its many associations with
leading events in Chinese early and feudal history render it an
interesting region to native scholars. A large part of the
southwestern prefecture of Shingan is hilly, and its mountainous
portions are inhabited by a rude, illiterate population, many
of whom are partly governed by local rulers.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">NATURAL AND POLITICAL FEATURES OF HUNAN.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Hunan</span> is bounded north by Hupeh, east by
Kiangsí, south by Kwangtung and Kwangsí, west by Kweichau
and Sz’chuen. Its area is reckoned at 84,000 square miles&mdash;equal
to Great Britain or the State of Kansas. It is drained
by four rivers, whose basins comprise nearly the whole province,
and define its limits by their terminal watersheds. The
largest is the Siang, which, rising in the hills on the south and
east in numerous navigable streams, affords facilities for trade
in small boats to the borders of Kiangsí and Kwangtung,
the traffic concentring at Siangtan; this fertile and populous
basin occupies well-nigh half of the province. Through the
western part of Hunan runs the Yuen kiang, but the rapids
and cascades occur so frequently as to render it far less useful
than the Siang. Boats are towed up to the towns in the south-west
with great labor, carrying only four or five tons cargo;
these are exchanged for mere scows at Hangkia, 200 miles
above Changteh, in order to reach Yuenchau. The contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
between the two rivers as serviceable channels of intercourse is
notable. Between these two main rivers runs the Tsz’ kiang,
navigable for only small batteaux, which must be pulled up so
many rapids that the river itself has been called Tan ho, or
‘Rapid River;’ its basin is narrow and fertile, and the produce
is carried to market over the hills both east and west. The
fourth river, the Lí shui, empties, like all the others, into the
Tungting Lake, and drains the northwestern portion of the
province; it is navigable only in its lower course, and is almost
useless for travel. These rivers all keep their own channels
through the lake, which is rather a cesspool for the overflow of
the Yangtsz’ during its annual rise than a lake fed by its own
springs and affluents. At Siangyin, on the River Siang, the
banks are 35 feet above low water, and gradually slope down
to its mouth at Yohchau, or near it. The variation of this
lake from a large sheet of water at one season to a marsh at
another, must of course affect the whole internal trade of the
province, inasmuch as the rivers running through it are in a
continual condition of flood or low water&mdash;either extreme
cannot but seriously interfere with steam vessels.</p>

<p>The productions of Hunan do not represent a very high development
of its soil or mines. Tea and coal are the main exports;
tea-oil, ground-nut and <i>tung</i> oils, hemp, tobacco, and
rice, with iron, copper, tin, and coarse paper make up the list.
The coal-fields of southern Hunan contain deposits equal to
those in Pennsylvania; anthracite occurs on the River Lui, and
bituminous on the River Siang, both beds reaching over the
border into Kwangtung. The timber trade in pine, fir, laurel,
and other woods is also important. The population of Hunan
was somewhat reduced during the Tai-ping rebellion; its inhabitants
have in general a bad reputation among their countrymen
for violence and rudeness. The hilly nature of the country
tends to segregate them into small communities, which are
imperfectly acquainted with each other, because travelling is
difficult; nor is the soil fertile enough to support in many districts
a considerable increase of population.</p>

<p>The capital of Hunan, Changsha, lies on the River Siang,
and is one of the most influential, as it is historically one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
most interesting, cities in the central part of China; the festival
of the Dragon Boats originated here. Siangtan, at the
confluence of the Lien kí, more than 200 miles above Yohchau,
is one of the greatest tea-marts in China. Its population is
reckoned to be a million, and it is a centre of trade and banking
for the products of this and other regions; it extends for
three miles along the west bank, and nearly two miles inland,
with thousands of boats lining the shores. Its return to prosperity
since the rebellion has been marvellously rapid. The
city of Changteh on the Yuen River is the next important
town, as it is easily reached from Yohchau on the Yangtsz’;
large amounts of rice are grown in the prefecture.</p>

<p>Hunan has a high position for letters, the people are well
dressed, healthy, and usually peaceable. The boating population
is, however, exceptionally lawless, and forms a difficult
class for the local authorities to control. Aboriginal hill-tribes
exist in the southwestern districts, which are still more unmanageable,
probably through the unjust taxation and oppression
of the imperial officers set over them. In addition to these
ungovernable elements a large area is occupied by the <i>Yao-jin</i>,
who have possessed themselves of the elevated territory lying
between Yungchau and Kweiyang, in the southern point of the
province, and there barricaded the mountain passes so that no
one can ascend against their will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS OF SHENSÍ.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Shensí</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, Western Defiles) is bounded
north by Inner Mongolia, from which it is divided by the Great
Wall, east by Shansí and Honan, southeast by Hupeh, south
by Sz’chuen, and west by Kansuh. Its area is not far from
70,000 square miles, which is geologically and politically most
distinctly marked by the Tsingling shan, the watershed between
the Wei and Han rivers. There is only one good road
across it to Hanchung fu near its southern part; another,
farther east, goes from Sí-ngan, by a natural pass between it
and the Fuh-niu shan, to Shang, on the Tan ho, in the Han
basin. This part comprises about one-third of Shensí. The
other portion includes the basins of the Wei, Loh and Wu-ting,
and some smaller tributaries of the Yellow River, of which the
Wei is the most important. This river joins the Yellow at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
lowest point of its basin, the Tung-kwan pass, where the larger
stream breaks through into the lowlands of Honan, and divides
eastern and southern China from the northwestern regions.
The whole of this part presents a loess formation, and the beds
of the streams are cut deep into it, the roads across them being
few. The Wei basin is the most fertile part of the province;
the history of the Chinese race has been more connected
with its fortunes than with any other portion of their possessions.
Its productiveness is shown in the rapid development
and peopling of the districts along the banks and affluents.</p>

<p>On the north, the Great Wall separates Shensí from the
Ordos Mongols, its western end reaching the Yellow River at
Ninghia&mdash;the largest and only important city in that region.
All the connections with this region are through Shensí and by
Kwei-hwa-ching, but the configuration of the ranges of hills prevents
direct travel. None of the rivers in this region are serviceable
to any great degree for navigation, and but few of them
for irrigation; the crops depend on the rainfall. The climate
is more equable and mild than in Shansí, and not so wet as in
many parts of Kansuh. The harvests of one good year here
furnish food for three poor ones. The chief dependence of the
people is on wheat, but rice is grown wherever water can be
had; sorghum, millet, pulse, maize, barley, ground-nut, and fruits
of many sorts fill up the list. Cotton, hemp, tobacco, rapeseed,
and poppy are largely cultivated, but the surplus of any crop
is not enough in average years to leave much for export.
The ruthless civil war recently quenched in the destruction of
the Mohammedans in the province has left it quite desolate in
many parts, and its restoration to former prosperity and population
must be slow.</p>

<p>The travel between Shensí and Sz’chuen is almost wholly
confined to the great road reaching from Sí-ngan to Chingtu.
It passes along the River Wei to Hienyang hien on the left
bank, where the road north into Kansuh diverges, the other continuing
west along the river through a populous region to Paokí
hien, where it recrosses the Wei. During this portion, the
Tai-peh Mountain, about eleven thousand feet high, with its white
summit, adds a prominent feature to the scenery. At Paokí,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the crossing at the Tsingling shan commences, and occupies
seven days of difficult travel through a devious road of 163
miles to Fung hien on the confines of Kansuh. It crosses successive
ridges from 6,000 to 9,000 feet high, and is carried along
the sides of hills and down the gorges in a manner reflecting
much credit on the engineers of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> who
made it. These mountainous regions are thinly settled all the
way down to Paoching, near Hanchung; but upon gaining the
River Han, one of the most beautiful and fertile valleys in
China is reached. Its western watershed is the Kiu-tiao shan,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
running southwesterly into Sz’chuen on the west side of the
Kialing River.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SÍ-NGAN ITS CAPITAL.</div>

<p>The city of Sí-ngan is the capital of the northwest of China,
and next to Peking in size, population, and importance. It surpasses
that city in historical interest and records, and in the
long centuries of its existence has upheld its earlier name of
<i>Chang-an</i>, or ‘Continuous Peace.’ The approach to it from
the east lies across a bluff, whose eastern face is filled with houses
cut in the dry earth, and from whose summit the lofty towers
and imposing walls are seen across the plain three miles away.
These defences were too solid for the Mohammedan rebels, and
protected the citizens while even their suburbs were burned.
The population occupies the entire enciente, and presents a
heterogeneous sprinkling of Tibetans, Mongols and Tartars, of
whom many thousand Moslems are still spared because they
were loyal. Sí-ngan has been taken and retaken, rebuilt and
destroyed, since its establishment in the twelfth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> by
the Martial King, but its position has always assured for it the
control of trade between the central and western provinces and
Central Asia. The city itself is picturesquely situated, and contains
some few remains of its ancient importance, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
neighborhood promises better returns to the sagacious antiquarian
and explorer than any portion of China. The principal
record of the Nestorian mission work in China, the famous tablet
of <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 781, still remains in the yard of a temple. Some miles to
the northwest lies the temple Ta-fu-sz’, containing a notable
colossus of Buddha, the largest in China, said to have been cut
by one of the Emperors of the Tang in the ninth century.
This statue is in a cave hewn out of the sandstone rock, being
cut out of the same material and left in the construction of the
grotto. Its height is 56 feet; the proportions of limbs and
body of the sitting figure are, on the whole, good, the Buddha
being represented with right hand upraised in blessing, and the
figure as well as garments richly covered with color and gilt.
Before the god stand two smaller colossi of the <i>Schang-hoa</i>,
Buddha’s favorite disciples; their inferior art and workmanship,
however, testify to a later origin. The cave is lighted from
above, after the manner of the Pantheon, by a single round
opening in the vaulting. Sixty feet over the rock temple rises
a tile roofing, and upon the hillside without the cavern are a
number of minor temples and statues.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Next to this city in importance is Hanchung, near the border
of Sz’chuen; it was much injured by the Tai-pings, and is
only slowly recovering, like all the towns in that valley which
were exposed; none of these rebels crossed the Tsingling
Mountains. Yu-lin (‘Elm Forest’) is an important city on the
Great Wall in the north of Shensí, the station of a garrison
which overawes the Mongols. Several marts carrying on considerable
trade are on or near the Wei and Han Rivers.</p>

<p>Gold mines occur in Shensí, and gold is collected in some of
the streams; other metals also are worked. The climate is too
cold for rice and silk; wheat, millet, oats, maize, and cotton
supply their places; rhubarb, musk, wax, red-lead, coal, and
nephrite are exported. The trade of Sí-ngan is chiefly that of
bartering the produce of the eastern provinces (reaching it by
the great pass of Tung-kwan) and that from Tibet, Kansuh, and
Ílí. Wild animals still inhabit the northern parts, and the num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>ber
of horses, sheep, goats, and cattle raised for food and service
is large compared with eastern China.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KANSUH PROVINCE.</div>

<p>The immense province of <span class="smcap">Kansuh</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, Voluntary Reverence,
made by uniting the names of Kanchau fu and Suh chau) belonged
at one time to Shensí, and extended no farther west than Kiayü
kwan; but since the division by Kienlung, its limits have been
stretched across the desert to the confines of Songaria on the
northwest, and to the borders of Tibet on the west. It is
bounded north and northeast by Gobi and the Dsassaktu
khanate, east by Shensí, south by Sz’chuen, southwest by Koko-nor
and the desert, and northwest by Cobdo and Ílí. Its entire
area cannot be much under 400,000 square miles, the greater
part of which is a barren waste; it extends across twelve degrees
of latitude and twenty-one degrees of longitude, and comprises
all the best part of the ancient kingdom of Tangut, which
was destroyed by Genghis.</p>

<p>The topography of this vast region is naturally divided into
two distinct areas by the Kiayü kwan at the end of the Great
Wall; one a fertile, well-watered, populous country, differing
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toto cœlo</i> from the sandy or mountainous wildernesses of the
other. The eastern portion is further partitioned into two sections
by the ranges of mountains which cross it nearly from
south to north in parallel lines, dividing the basins of the Wei
and Yellow Rivers near the latter. The passage between them
is over the Făn-shui ling, not far from the Tao ho and by the
town of Tihtao, leading thence up to Lanchau. This part of
the province, watered by the Wei, resembles Shansí in fertility
and productions, and its nearness to the elevated ranges of the
Bayan-kara induces comparatively abundant rainfall. The
streams in the extreme south flow into Sz’chuen, but furnish
few facilities for navigation. The affluents of the Yellow River
are on the whole less useful for irrigation and navigation, and
the four or five which join it near Lanchau vary too much in
their supply of water to be depended on.</p>

<p>The peculiar feature of Kansuh is the narrow strip projecting
like a wedge into the Tibetan plateau, reaching from Lanchau
northwesterly between the Ala shan and Kílien shan to the end
of the Great Wall. This strip of territory commands the pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>sage
between the basin of the Tarim River and Central Asia
and China Proper; its passage nearly controls trade and power
throughout the northern provinces. The Ta-tung River flows
on the south of the Kílien Mountains, but the travel goes near
the Wall, where food and fuel are abundant, a long distance
beyond its end&mdash;even to the desert. The roads from Sí-ngan
to Lanchau pass up the King River to Pingliang and across
several ranges, or else go farther up the River Wei to Tsin chau;
the distances are between 500 and 600 miles. From Lanchau
one road goes along the Yellow River down to Ninghia, a town
inhabited chiefly by Mongols. Another leads 90 miles west to
Síning, whither the tribes around Koko-nor repair for trade.
The most important continues to Suhchau, this being an easier
journey, while its trade furnishes employment to denizens of
the region, whose crops are taken by travellers on passage; this
road is about 500 miles in length. Its great importance from
early days is indicated by the erection of the Great Wall, in
order to prevent inroads along its sides, and by the fortress of
Kiayü, which shuts the door upon enemies.</p>

<p>The climate of Kansuh exhibits a remarkable contrast to that
of the eastern provinces. Prejevalsky says it is damp in three
of the seasons; clear, cold winds blowing in winter, and alternating
with calm, warm weather; out of 92 days up to September
30, he registered 72 rainy days, twelve of them snowy.
The highest temperature was 88° F. in July. Snow and hail
also fall in May. North of the Ala shan, which divides this
moist region from the desert, everything is dry and sandy;
their peaks attract the clouds, which sometimes discharge their
contents in torrents, and leave the northern slopes dry; a marsh
appears over against and only a few miles from a sandy waste.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The country east of the Yellow River is fertile, and produces
wheat, oats, barley, millet, and other edible plants. Wild animals
are frequent, whose chase affords both food and peltry;
large flocks and herds are also maintained by Tartars living
within the province. The mountains contain metals and minerals,
among which are copper, almagatholite, jade, gold, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
silver. The capital, Lanchau, lies on the south side of the Yellow
River, where it turns northeast; the valley is narrow, and
defended on the west by a pass, through which the road goes
westward. At Síning fu, about a hundred miles east of Tsing
hai, the superintendent of Koko-nor resides; its political importance
has largely increased its trade within the last few
years. Ninghia fu, in the northeast of the province, is the
largest town on the borders of the desert. The destruction of
life and all its resources during the recent Mohammedan rebellion,
which was crushed out at Suhchau in October, 1873, is not
likely to be repeated soon, as the rebels were all destroyed;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
their Toorkish origin can even now be traced in their features.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
No reliable description of the towns belonging to Kansuh in
the districts around Barkul, since the pacification of the country
by the Chinese, has been made.</p>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Sz’chuen</span> (‘Four Streams’) was the largest of
the old eighteen before Kansuh was extended across the desert,
and is now one of the richest in its productions. It is bounded
north by Kansuh and Shensí, east by Hupeh and Hunan, south
by Kweichau and Yunnan, west and northwest by Tibet and
Koko-nor; its area is 166,800 square miles, or double most of
the other provinces, rather exceeding Sweden in superficies, as it
falls below California, while it is superior to both in navigable
rivers and productions. The emperors at Sí-ngan always depended
upon it as the main prop of their power, and in the
third century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> the After Hans ruled at its capital over the
west of China.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOPOGRAPHY OF SZ’CHUEN PROVINCE.</div>

<p>Sz’chuen is naturally divided by the four great rivers which
run from north to south into the Yangtsz’, and thus form parallel
basins; as a whole these comprise about half of the entire
area, and all of the valuable portion. The western part beyond
the Min River belongs to the high table lands of Central Asia,
and is little else than a series of mountain ranges, sparsely
populated and unfit for cultivation, except in small spaces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
bottom lands. The eastern portion is a triangular shaped region
surrounded with high mountains composed of Silurian and
Devonian formations with intervening deposits, mostly of red
clayey sandstone, imparting a peculiar brick color, which has
led Baron von Richthofen to call it the Red Basin. The ranges
of hills average about 3,500 feet high, but the rivers have cut
their channels through the deposits from 1,500 to 2,500 feet
deep, making the travel up and down their waters neither rapid
nor easy. The towns which define this triangular red basin are
Kweichau on the Yangtsz’, from which a line running south
of the river to Pingshan hien, not far from Süchau at its
confluence with the Min, gives the southern border; thence
taking a circuit as far west as Yachau fu on the Tsing-í River,
and turning northwesterly to Lung-ngan fu, the western side is
roughly skirted, while the eastern side returns to Kweichau
along the watershed of the River Han. Within this area, life,
industry, wealth, prosperity, are all found; outside of it, as a
rule, the rivers are unnavigable, the country uncultivable, and
the people wild and insubordinate, especially on the south and
west.</p>

<p>The four chief rivers in the province, flowing into the Yangtsz’,
are the Kialing, the Loh, the Min, and the Yalung, the
last and westerly being regarded as the main stream of the
Great River, which is called the Kin-sha kiang, west of the
Min. The Kialing rises in Kansuh, and retains that name
along one trunk stream to its mouth, receiving scores of tributaries
from the ridges between its basin and the Han, until it
develops into one of the most useful watercourses in China,
coming perhaps next to the Pearl River in Kwangtung. Chungking,
at its embouchure, is the largest depot for trade west of
Íchang, and like St. Louis, on the Mississippi, will grow in importance
as the country beyond develops. The River Fo Loh
(called <i>Fu-sung</i> by Blakiston) is the smallest of the four, its
headwaters being connected with the Min above Chingtu; the
town of Lu chau stands at its mouth; through its upper part it
is called Chung kiang. The Min River has its fountains near
those of the Kialing in Koko-nor, and like that stream it gathers
contributions from the ranges defining and crossing its basin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
as it descends into the plain of Chingtu, its waters divide into a
dozen channels below Hwan hien, and after running more than
a hundred miles reunite above Mei hien, forming a deep and
picturesque river down to Süchau, a thousand miles and more
from the source. At its junction, the Min almost doubles the
volume of water in summer, when the snows melt. The Yalung
River is the only large affluent between the Min and the
main trunk; it comes from the Bayan-kara Mountains, between
the headwaters of the Yellow and Yangtsz’ Rivers, and receives
no important tributaries in its long, solitary, and unfructuous
course. The Abbé Huc speaks of crossing its rapid channel
near Makian-Dsung just before reaching Tatsienlu, the frontier
town; it takes three names in its course.</p>

<p>From Chingtu as a centre, many roads radiate to the other
large towns in the province, by which travel and trade find free
course, and render the connections with other provinces safe
and easy. The roads are paved with flagstones wide enough
to allow passage for two pack-trains abreast; stairs are made
on the inclines, up and down which mules and ponies travel
without risk, though most of the goods and passengers are
carried by coolies. In order to facilitate travel, footpaths are
opened and paved, leading to every hamlet, and wherever the
traffic will afford it, bridges of cut stone, iron chains or wire,
span the torrent or chasm, according as the exigency requires;
towns or hamlets near these structures take pride in keeping
them in repair.</p>

<p>The products of this fertile region are varied and abundant.
Rice and wheat alternate each other in summer and winter, but
the amount of land producing food is barely sufficient for its
dense population; pulse, barley, maize, ground-nuts, sorghum,
sweet and common potatoes, buckwheat and tobacco, are each
raised for home consumption. Sugar, hemp, oils of several
kinds, cotton, and fruits complete the list of plants mostly
grown for home use. The exports consist of raw and woven
silk, of which more is sent abroad than from any province; salt,
opium, musk, croton (<i>tung</i>) oil, gentian, rhubarb, tea, coal,
spelter, copper, iron, and insect wax, are all grown or made for
other regions. The peace which Sz’chuen enjoyed while other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
provinces were ravaged by rebels, has tended to develop all its
products, and increase its abundance. The climate of this
region favors the cultivation of the hillsides, which are composed
of disintegrated sandstones, because the moist and mild
winters bring forward the winter crops; snow remains only a
few days, if it fall at all, and wheat is cut before May. The
summer rains and freshets furnish water for the rice fields by
filling the streams on a thousand hills. This climate is a great
contrast to the dry regions further north, and it is subject to
less extremes of temperature and moisture than Yunnan south
of it. When this usual experience is altered by exceptional dry
or wet seasons, the people are left without food, and their wants
cannot be supplied by the abundance of other provinces, owing
to the slowness of transit. Brigandage, rioting, cannibalism,
and other violence then add to the misery of the poor, and to
the difficulty of government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINGTU AND THE MIN VALLEY.</div>

<p>Chingtu, the capital, lies on the River Min, in the largest
plain in the province, roughly measuring a hundred miles one
way, and fifty the other, conspicuous for its riches and populousness.
The inhabitants are reckoned to number 3,500,000
souls. This city has been celebrated from the earliest days, but
received its present name of the ‘Perfect Capital’ when Liu Pí
made it his residence. Its population approaches a million, and
its walls, shops, yamuns, streets, warehouses, and suburbs, all
indicate its wealth and political importance. Marco Polo calls
it Sindafu, and the province Acbalec Manzi, describing the fine
stone bridge, half a mile long, with a roof resting on marble
pillars, under which “trade and industry is carried on,”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> which
spans the Kian-suy, <i>i.e.</i>, the Yangtsz’, as the Min is still often
termed. The remarkable cave houses of the old inhabitants
still attract the traveller’s notice as he journeys up to Chingtu,
along its banks.</p>

<p>M. David, who lived at this city several months, declares it
to be one of the most beautiful towns in China, placed in the
midst of a fertile plain watered by many canals, which form a
network of great solidity and usefulness. The number of hon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>orary
gateways in and near it attract the voyager’s eye, and
their variety, size, inscriptions, and age furnish an interesting
field of inquiry. Many statues cut in fine stone are scattered
about the city or used to adorn the cemeteries.</p>

<p>The city of Chungking, on the Yangtsz’, at the mouth of
the Kialing River, 725 miles from Hankow, is the next important
city in Sz’chuen, and the centre of a great trade on both
rivers. The other marts on the Great River are also at the
mouths of its affluents, and from Kwaichau to Süchau and
Pingshan hien, a distance of 496 miles, there is easy and safe
communication within the province for all kinds of boats;
steam vessels will also here find admirable opportunities for
their employment.</p>

<p>In the western half of Sz’chuen, the people are scattered
over intervales and slopes between the numberless hills and
mountains that make this one of the roughest parts of China;
they are governed by their own local rulers, under Chinese
superintendence. They belong to the Lolos race, and have
been inimical and insubordinate to Chinese rule from earliest
times, preventing their own progress and destroying all desire
on the part of their rulers to benefit them. Yachau fu, Tatsienlu,
and Batang are the largest towns west of Chingtu,
on the road to Tibet. On the other side of the province, at
Fungtu hien, occur the fire-wells, where great supplies of
petroleum gas are used to evaporate the salt dug out near by.
The many topics of interest in all parts of Sz’chuen, can only
be referred to in a brief sketch, for it is of itself a kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROVINCE OF KWANGTUNG.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Kwangtung</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, Broad East), from its having
been for a long time the only one of the eighteen to which
foreigners have had access, has almost become synonymous with
China, although but little more is really known of it than of
the others&mdash;except in the vicinage of Canton, and along the
course of the Peh kiang, from Nanhiung down to that city. It
is bounded north by Kiangsí and Hunan, northeast by Fuh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>kien,
south by the ocean, and west and northwest by Kwangsí;
with an area about the same as that of the United Kingdom.
The natural facilities for internal navigation and an extensive
coasting trade, are unusually great; for while its long line of
coast, nearly a thousand miles in length, affords many excellent
harbors, the rivers communicate with the regions on the west,
north, and east beyond its borders.</p>

<p>The Nan shan runs along the north, between it and Kiangsí
and Hunan, in a northeasterly and southwesterly direction,
presenting the same succession of short ridges, with bottom
lands and clear streams between them, which are seen in Fuhkien.
These ridges take scores of names as they follow one
another from Kwangsí to Fuhkien, but no part is so well known
as the road, twenty-four miles in length, which crosses the Mei
ling (<i>i.e.</i> Plum ridge), between Nan-ngan and Nanhiung. The
elevation here is about a thousand feet, none of the peaks in
this part exceeding two thousand, but rising higher to the west.
Their summits are limestone, with granite underlying; granite
is also the prevailing rock along the coast. Lí-mu ridge in
Hainan has some peaks reaching nearly to the snow-line. The
bottoms of the rivers are wide, and their fertility amply repays
the husbandman. Fruits, rice, silk, sugar, tobacco, and vegetables,
constitute the greater part of the productions. Lead,
iron, and coal, are abundant.</p>

<p>The Chu kiang, or Pearl River, which flows past Canton,
takes this name only in that short portion of its course; it is
however preferable to employ this as a distinctive name, comprehending
the whole stream, rather than to confuse the reader
by naming the numerous branches. It is formed by the union
of three rivers, the West, North, and East, the two first of
which unite at Sanshwui, west of the city, while the East River
joins them at Whampoa. The Sí kiang, or West River, by far
the largest, rises in the eastern part of Yunnan, and receives
tributaries throughout the whole of Kwangsí, along the southern
acclivities of the Nan shan, and after a course of 500 miles,
passes out to sea through numerous mouths, the best known of
which is the Bocca Tigris. The Peh kiang, or North River,
joins it after a course of 200 miles, and the East River is nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the same length; these two streams discharge the surplus waters
of all the northern parts of Kwangtung. The country drained
by the three cannot be much less than 150,000 square miles, and
most of their channels are navigable for boats to all the large
towns in this and the province of Kwangsí. The Han kiang is
the only river of importance in the eastern end of Kwangtung;
the large town of Chauchau lies near its mouth. There can
hardly be less than three hundred islands scattered along the
deeply indented coast line of this province between Namoh
Island and Annam, of which nearly one-third belong to the
department of Kwangchau.</p>

<p>Canton, or Kwangchau fu (<i>i.e.</i> Broad City), the provincial
capital, lies on the north bank of the Pearl River, in lat. 23° 7′
10″ N., and long. 113° 14′ 30″ E., nearly parallel with Havana,
Muskat, and Calcutta; its climate is, however, colder than any
of those cities. The name <i>Canton</i> is a corruption of Kwangtung,
derived in English from <i>Kamtom</i>, the Portuguese mode
of writing it; the citizens themselves usually call it <i>Kwangtung
săng ching</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the provincial capital of Kwangtung or simply
<i>săng ching</i>. Another name is <i>Yang-ching</i>, or the ‘City of
Rams,’ and a third the City of Genii, both derived from ancient
legends. It lies at the foot of the White Cloud hills, along the
banks of the river, about seventy miles north of Macao in a
direct line, and ninety northwest of Hongkong; these distances
are greater by the river.</p>

<p>The delta into which the West, North, and East Rivers fall
might be called a gulf, if the islands in it did not occupy so much
of the area. The whole forms one of the most fertile parts of
the province, and one of the most extensive estuaries of any
river in the world,&mdash;being a rough triangle about a hundred
miles long on each side. The bay of Lintin&mdash;so called from
the islet of that name, where opium and other store ships formerly
anchored&mdash;is the largest sheet of water, and lies below the
principal embouchure of the river, called <i>Fu Mun</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Bocca
Tigris, or Bogue. Few rivers can be more completely protected
by nature than this; their defences of walls and guns at this
spot, however, have availed the Chinese but little against the
skill and power of their enemies. Ships pass through it up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the anchorage at Whampoa, about thirty miles, from whence
Canton lies twelve miles nearly due west. The approach to it
is indicated by two lofty pagodas within the walls, and the multitude
of boats and junks thronging the river, amidst which the
most pleasing object to the “far-travelled stranger” is the
glimpse he gets through their masts of the foreign houses on
Sha-meen, and the flagstaffs bearing their national ensigns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIZE AND SITUATION OF CANTON.</div>

<p>The part of Canton inclosed by walls is about six miles in
circumference; having a partition wall running east and west,
which divides it into two unequal parts. The entire circuit, including
the suburbs, is nearly ten miles. The population on
land and water, so far as the best data enable one to judge,
cannot be less than a million of inhabitants. This estimate has
been doubted; and certainty upon the subject is not to be attained,
for the census affords no aid in determining this point,
owing to the fact that it is set down by districts, and Canton
lies partly in two districts, Nanhai and Pwanyü, which extend
beyond the walls many miles. Davis says, “the whole circuit
of the city has been compassed within two hours by persons on
foot, and cannot exceed six or seven miles;”&mdash;which is true, but
he means only that portion contained within the walls; and
there are at least as many houses without the walls as within
them, besides the boats. The city is constantly increasing, the
western suburbs present many new streets entirely built up
within the last ten years. The houses stretch along the river
from opposite the Fa tí or Flower grounds to French Folly, a
distance of four miles, and the banks are everywhere nearly
concealed by the boats and rafts.</p>

<p>The situation of Canton is one which would naturally soon
attract settlers. The earliest notices of the city date back two
centuries before Christ, but traders were doubtless located here
prior to that time. It grew in importance as the country became
better settled, and in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 700, a regular market was
opened, and a collector of customs appointed. When the Manchus
overran the country in 1650, this city resisted their utmost
efforts to reduce it for the space of eleven months, and was
finally carried by treachery. Martini states that a hundred
thousand <em>men</em> were killed at its sack; and the whole number who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
lost their lives at the final assault and during the siege was
700,000&mdash;if the native accounts are trustworthy.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Since then,
it has been rebuilt, and has increased in prosperity until it is regarded
as the second city in the empire for numbers, and is
probably at present the first in wealth.</p>

<p>The foundations of the city walls are of sandstone, their upper
part being brick; they are about twenty feet thick, and from
twenty-five to forty feet high, having an esplanade on the inside,
and pathways leading to the rampart, on three sides. The
houses are built near the wall on both sides of it, so that except
on the north, one hardly sees it when walking around the
city. There are twelve outer gates, four in the partition wall,
and two water gates, through which boats pass, into the moat,
from east to west. A ditch once encompassed the walls, now
dry on the northern side; on the other three, and within the
city, it and most of the canals are filled by the tide, which as it
runs out does much to cleanse the city from its sewage. The
gates are all shut at night, and a guard is stationed near them to
preserve order, but the idle soldiers themselves cause at times
no little disturbance. Among the names of the gates are <i>Great-Peace</i>
gate, <i>Eternal-Rest</i> gate, <i>Five-Genii</i> gate, <i>Bamboo-Wicket</i>
gate, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIGHTS OF CANTON CITY.</div>

<p>The appearance of the city when viewed from the hills on the
north is insipid and uninviting, compared with western cities,
being an expanse of reddish roofs, often concealed by frames
for drying or dyeing clothes, or shaded and relieved by a few
large trees, and interspersed with high, red poles used for flag-staffs.
Two pagodas shoot up within the walls, far above the
watch towers on them, and with the five-storied tower on
Kwanyin shan near the northern gate, form the most conspicuous
objects in the prospect.</p>

<p>To a spectator at this elevation, the river is a prominent feature
in the landscape, as it shines out covered with a great
diversity of boats of different colors and sizes, some stationary
others moving, and all resounding with the mingled hum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
laborers, sailors, musicians, hucksters, children, and boatwomen,
pursuing their several sports and occupations. On a low sandstone
ledge, in the channel off the city, once stood the Sea Pearl
(<i>Hai Chu</i>) Fort, called Dutch Folly by foreigners, the quietude
reigning within which contrasted agreeably with the liveliness
of the waters around. Beyond, on its southern shore, lie the
suburb and island of Honam, and green fields and low hills are
seen still farther in the distance; at the western angle of this
island the Pearl River divides, at the <i>Peh-ngo tan</i> or Macao
Passage, the greatest body of water flowing south, and leaving a
comparatively narrow channel before the city. The hills on the
north rise twelve hundred feet, their acclivities for miles being
covered with graves and tombs, the necropolis of this vast city.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>VIEW OF A STREET IN CANTON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The streets are too narrow to be seen from such a spot.
Among their names, amounting in all to more than six hundred,
are <i>Dragon</i> street, <i>Martial Dragon</i> street, <i>Pearl</i> street, <i>Golden
Flower</i> street, <i>New Green Pea</i> street, <i>Physic</i> street, <i>Spectacle</i>
street, <i>Old Clothes</i> street, etc. They are not as dirty as those
of some other cities in the empire, and on the whole, considering
the habits of the people and surveillance of the government,
which prevents almost everything like public spirit, Canton has
been a well governed, cleanly city. In these respects it is not
now as well kept, perhaps, as it was before the war, nor was it
ever comparable to modern cities in the West, nor should it be
likened to them: without a corporation to attend to its condition,
or having power to levy taxes to defray its unavoidable
expenses, it cannot be expected that it should be as wholesome.
It is more surprising, rather, that it is no worse than it is. The
houses along the waterside are built upon piles and those portions
of the city are subject to inundations. On the edge of the
stream, the water percolates the soil, and spoils all the wells.</p>

<p>The temples and public buildings of Canton are numerous.
There are two pagodas near the west gate of the old city, and
one hundred and twenty-four temples, pavilions, halls, and other
religious edifices within the circuit of the city. The <i>Kwang
tah</i> or ‘Plain pagoda,’ was erected by the Mohammedans (who
still reside near it), about ten centuries ago, and is rather a minaret
than a pagoda, though quite unlike those structures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Turkey in its style of architecture; it shoots up in an angular,
tapering tower, to the height of one hundred and sixty feet. The
other is an octagonal pagoda, of nine stories, one hundred and
seventy feet high, first erected more than thirteen hundred years
ago. The geomancers say that the whole city is like a junk,
these two pagodas are her masts, and the five-storied tower on
the northern wall, her stern sheets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUDDHIST TEMPLES IN CANTON.</div>

<p>Among the best known monuments to foreigners visiting this
city was the monastery of <i>Chong-show sz’</i>, ‘Temple of Longevity,’
founded in 1573, and occupying spacious grounds. “In
the first pavilion are three Buddhas; in the second a seven-story,
gilt pagoda, in which are 79 images of Buddha. In the
third pavilion is an image of Buddha reclining, and in a merry
mood. A garden in the rear is an attractive place of resort,
and another, on one side of the entrance, has a number of tanks
in which gold fish are reared. In the space in front of the temple
a fair is held every morning for the sale of jade ornaments
and other articles.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> This temple was destroyed in November,
1881, by a mob who were incensed at the alleged misbehaviour
of some of the priests toward the female devotees&mdash;an instance
of the existence in China of a lively popular sentiment regarding
certain matters. Near this compound stands the ‘Temple
of the Five Hundred Genii,’ containing 500 statues of various
sizes in honor of Buddha and his disciples.</p>

<p>The <i>Hai-chwang sz’</i>, a Buddhist temple at Honam usually
known as the Honam Joss-house, is one of the largest in Canton.
Its grounds cover about seven acres, surrounded by a wall,
and divided into courts, garden-spots, and a burial-ground,
where are deposited the ashes of priests after cremation. The
buildings consist mostly of cloisters or apartments surrounding
a court, within which is a temple, a pavilion, or a hall; these
courts are overshadowed by bastard-banian trees, the resort of
thousands of birds. The outer gateway leads up a gravelled
walk to a high portico guarded by two huge demoniac figures,
through which the visitor enters a small inclosure, separated
from the largest one by another spacious porch, in which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
four colossal statues. This conducts him to the main temple, a
low building one hundred feet square, and surrounded by pillars;
it contains three wooden gilded images, in a sitting posture,
called <i>San Pao Fuh</i>, or the Past, Present, and Future
Buddha, each of them about twenty-five feet high, and surrounded
by numerous altars and attendant images. Daily
prayers are chanted before them by a large chapter of priests,
all of whom, dressed in yellow canonicals, go through the liturgy.
Beyond this a smaller building contains a marble carving somewhat
resembling a pagoda, under which is preserved a relic of
Buddha, said to be one of his toe-nails. This court has other
shrines, and many rooms for the accommodation of the priests,
among which are the printing-office and library, both of them
respectable for size, and containing the blocks of books issued
by them, and sold to devotees.</p>

<p>There are about one hundred and seventy-five priests connected
with the establishment, only a portion of whom can read.
Among the buildings are several small temples dedicated to
national deities whom the Buddhists have adopted into their
mythology. One of the houses adjoining holds the hogs (not
<em>bugs</em>, as was stated in one work) offered by worshippers who
feed them as long as they live.</p>

<p>Two other shrines belonging to the Buddhists, are both of
them, like the Honam temple, well endowed. One called <i>Kwanghiao
sz’</i>, or ‘Temple of Glorious Filial Duty,’ contains two hundred
priests, who are supported from glebe lands, estimated at
three thousand five hundred acres. The number of priests and
nuns in Canton is not exactly known, but probably exceeds two
thousand, nine-tenths of whom are Buddhists. There are only
three temples of the Rationalists, their numbers and influence
being far less in this city than those of the Buddhists.</p>

<p>The <i>Ching-hwang miao</i> is an important religious institution
in every Chinese city, the temple, being a sort of palladium, in
which both rulers and people offer their devotions for the welfare
of the city. The superintendent of that in Canton pays
$4,000 for his situation, which sum, with a large profit, is obtained
again in a few years, by the sale of candles, incense, etc.,
to the worshippers. The temples in China are generally cheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>less
and gloomy abodes, well enough fitted, however, for the
residence of inanimate idols and the performance of unsatisfying
ceremonies. The entrance courts are usually occupied by
hucksters, beggars, and idlers, who are occasionally driven off
to give room for the mat-sheds in which theatrical performances
got up by priests are acted. The principal hall, where
the idol sits enshrined, is lighted only in front, and the altar,
drums, bells, and other furniture of the temple, are little calculated
to enliven it; the cells and cloisters are inhabited by
men almost as senseless as the idols they serve, miserable beings,
whose droning, useless life is too often only a cloak for vice,
indolence, and crime, which make the class an opprobrium in
the eyes of their countrymen.</p>

<p>Canton is the most influential city in Southern China, and its
reputation for riches and luxury is established throughout the
central and northern provinces, owing to its formerly engrossing
the entire foreign trade up to 1843, for a period of about one
hundred years. At that time the residence of the governor-general
was at Shao-king fu, west of Canton, and his official
guard of 5,000 troops is still quartered there, as the Manchu
garrison is deemed enough for the defence of Canton. He and
the Hoppo, or collector of customs, once had their yamuns in the
New City, but a Romish Cathedral has been built on the site
of the former’s office since its capture in 1857. The governor,
treasurer, Manchu commandant, chancellor, and the lower local
magistrates (ten in all), live in the Old City, and with their official
retinues compose a large body of underlings. Some of these
establishments occupy four or five acres.</p>

<p>The <i>Kung Yuen</i> or Examination Hall, lies in the southeastern
corner of the Old City, similar in size and arrangement to these
edifices in other cities. It is 1,330 feet long, 583 wide, and
covers over sixteen acres. The wall surrounding it is entered
at the east and west corners of the south end, where door-keepers
are stationed to prevent a crowd of idlers. The cells are
arranged in two sets on each side of the main passage, which
is paved and lined with trees; they are further disposed in rows
of 57 and 63 cells each&mdash;all reached through one side door.
The total is 8,653; each cell is 5 feet 9 inches deep, by 3 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
8 inches wide; grooves are made in the wall to admit a plank,
serving as a table by day and a bed by night. Once within, the
students are confined to their several stalls, and the outer gate is
sealed. A single roof covers the cells of one range, the ranges
being 3 feet 8 inches apart. The northern portion includes
about one-third of the whole, and is built over with the halls,
courts, lodging-rooms, and guard or eating-houses of the highest
examiners, their assistants and copyists, with thousands of
waiters, printers, underlings, and soldiers. At the biennial
examination the total number of students and others in the Hall
reaches nearly twelve thousand men.</p>

<p>There are four prisons in the city, all of them large establishments;
all the capital offenders in the province are brought
to Canton for trial before the provincial officers, and this regulation
makes it necessary to provide spacious accommodations
for them. The execution-ground is a small yard near a pottery
manufacture between the southern gate and the river side, and
unless the ground is newly stained with blood, or cages containing
the heads of the criminals are hung around, has nothing about
it to attract the attention. Another public building, situated
near the governor’s palace, is the <i>Wan-shao kung</i>, or ‘Imperial
Presence hall,’ where three days before and after his majesty’s
birthday, the officers and citizens assemble to pay him adoration.
The various guilds among the people, and the clubs of scholars
and merchants from other provinces, have, each of them, public
halls which are usually called <i>consoo houses</i> by foreigners, from
a corruption of a native term <i>kung-sz’</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, public hall; but the
usual designation is <i>kwui kwan</i> or ‘Assembly Hall.’ Their
total number must be quite one hundred and fifty, and some of
them are not destitute of elegance.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE THIRTEEN HONGS OR FACTORIES.</div>

<p>The former residences of foreigners in the western suburbs
were known as <i>Shih-san Hang</i>, or ‘Thirteen Hongs,’<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
nearly two centuries furnished almost the only exhibition to the
Chinese people of the <i>yang jin</i> or ‘ocean-men.’ Here the fears
and the greed of the rulers, landlords, and traders combined to
restrain foreigners of all nations within an area of about fifteen
acres, a large part of this space being the Garden or <i>Respondentia</i>
Walk on the bank of the river. All these houses and
out-houses covered a space scarcely as great as the base of the
Great Pyramid; its total population, including native and foreign
servants, was upwards of a thousand souls. The shops and
markets of the Chinese were separated from them only a few
feet, and this greatly increased the danger from fire, as may
be inferred from the <a href="#i_f168a">sketch</a> of the street next on the west side.
In 1856, the number of hongs was reckoned to be 16, and the
local calendar for that year contained 317 names, not including
women and children. Besides the 16 hongs, four native streets,
bordered with shops for the sale of fancy and silk goods to
their foreign customers, ran between the factories. This latter
name was given to them from their being the residences of
<i>factors</i>, for no handicraft was carried on here, nor were many
goods stored in them. Fires were not unusual, which demolished
portions of them; in 1822 they were completely consumed;
another conflagration in 1843 destroyed two hongs and a
street of shops; and in 1842, owing to a sudden riot, connected
with paying the English indemnity, the British Consulate was
set on fire. Finally, as if to inaugurate a new era, they were
all simultaneously burned by the local authorities to drive out
the British forces, in December, 1856, and every trace of this
interesting spot as it existed for so long a time in the annals of
foreign intercourse obliterated. Since the return of trade, a
new and better site has been formed at Shameen, west of the
old spot, by building a solid stone wall and filling in a long,
marshy low-tide bank, formerly occupied by boats, to a height
of 8 or 10 feet, on which there is room for gardens as well as
houses. This is surrounded by water, and thereby secure from
fire and mobs to which the old hongs were exposed. Residences
are obtainable anywhere in the city by foreigners, and
the common sight in the olden times of their standing outside
of the <i>Great Peace Gate</i> to see the crowd pass in and out while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
they themselves could not enter, is no longer seen. A very
good map of the enciente was made by an American missionary,
Daniel Vrooman, by taking the angles of all the conspicuous
buildings therein, with the highest points in the suburbs; he
then taught a native to pace the streets between them, compass
in hand (noting courses and distances, which he fixed by the
principal gates), until a complete plan was filled out. When
the city was opened four years afterwards this map was found
to need no important corrections.</p>

<p>The trades and manufactories at Canton are mainly connected
with the foreign commerce. Many silk fabrics are woven at
Fatshan, a large town situated about ten miles west of the city;
fire-crackers, paper, mat-sails, cotton cloth, and other articles,
are also made there for exportation. The number of persons
engaged in weaving cloth in Canton is about 50,000, including
embroiderers; nearly 7,000 barbers and 4,200 shoemakers are
stated as the number licensed to shave the crowns and shoe the
soles of their fellow-citizens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENVIRONS OF CANTON.</div>

<p>The opposite suburb of Honam offers pleasant walks for recreation,
and the citizens are in the habit of going over the river
to saunter in its fields, or in the cool grounds of the great
temple; a race-course and many enjoyable rides on horseback
also tempt foreigners into the country. A couple of miles up
the river are the Fa tí or Flower gardens which once supplied
the plants carried out of the country, and are resorted to by
pleasure parties; but to one accustomed to the squares, gardens,
and esplanades of western cities, these grounds appear mean in
the extreme. Foreigners ramble into the country, but rowing
upon the river is their favorite recreation. Like Europeans in
all parts of the East, they retain their own costume and modes
of living, and do not espouse native styles; though if it were
not for the shaven crown, it is not unlikely that many of them
would adopt the Chinese dress.</p>

<p>The Cantonese enumerate eight remarkable localities, called
<i>pah king</i>, which they consider worthy the attention of the
stranger. The first is the peak of Yuehsiu, just within the
walls on the north of the city, and commanding a fine view of
the surrounding country. The <i>Pi-pa Tah</i>, or Lyre pagoda at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Whampoa, and the ‘Eastern Sea Fish-pearl,’ a rock in the Pearl
River off the city, on which the fort already referred to as
the ‘Dutch Folly’ was formerly situated, are two more; the
pavilion of the Five Genii, with the five stone rams, and print
of a man’s foot in the rock, “always filled with water,” near
by; the rocks of Yu-shan; the lucky wells of Faukiu in the
western suburbs; cascade of Sí-tsiau, forty miles west of the
city; and a famous red building in the city, complete the eight
“lions.”</p>

<p>The foreign shipping all anchored, in the early days, at
Whampoa, but this once important anchorage has been nearly
deserted since the river steamers began their trips to the outer
waters. There are two islands on the south side of the anchorage,
called French and Danes’ islands, on which foreigners are
buried, some of the gravestones marking a century past. The
prospect from the summit of the hills hereabouts is picturesque
and charming, giving the spectator a high idea of the fertility
and industry of the land and its people. The town of Whampoa
and its pagoda lie north of the anchorage; between this and
Canton is another, called Lob creek pagoda, both of them uninhabited
and decaying.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MACAO AND HONGKONG.</div>

<p>Macao (pronounced <i>Makow</i>) is a Portuguese settlement on a
small peninsula projecting from the south-eastern end of the
large island of Hiangshan. Its Chinese inhabitants have been
governed since 1849 by the Portuguese authorities somewhat
differently from their own people, but the mixed government
has succeeded very well. The circuit of this settlement is about
eight miles; its position is beautiful and very agreeable; nearly
surrounded with water, and open to the sea breezes, having a
good variety of hill and plain even in its little territory, and a
large island on the west called <i>Tui-mien shan</i> or Lapa Island,
on which are pleasant rambles, to be reached by equally pleasant
boat excursions, it offers, moreover, one of the healthiest
residences in south-eastern Asia. The population is not far
from 80,000, of whom more than 7,000 are Portuguese and
other foreigners, living under the control of the Portuguese
authorities. The Portuguese have refused to pay the former
annual ground-rent of 600 taels to the Chinese Government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
since the assassination of their governor in 1849, and now control
all the inhabitants living within the Barrier wall, most of
whom have been born therein. The houses occupied by the
foreign population are solidly built of brick or adobie, large,
roomy, and open, and from the rising nature of the ground on
which they stand, present an imposing appearance to the visitor
coming in from the sea.</p>

<p>There are a few notable buildings in the settlement; the
most imposing edifice, St. Paul’s church, was burned in 1835.
Three forts on commanding eminences protect the town, and
others outside of the walls defend its waters; the governor
takes the oaths of office in the Monte fort; but the government
offices are mostly in the Senate house, situated in the middle of
the town. Macao was, up to 1843, the only residence for the
families of merchants trading at Canton. Of late the authorities
are doing much to revive the prosperity of the place, by making
it a free port. The Typa anchorage lies between the islands
Mackerara and Typa, about three miles off the southern end
of the peninsula; all small vessels go into the Inner harbor on
the west side of the town. Ships anchoring in the Roads are
obliged to lie about three miles off in consequence of shallow
water, and large ones cannot come nearer than six or seven miles.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Since the ascendancy of Hongkong, this once celebrated port
has fallen away in trade and importance, and for many years
had an infamous reputation for the protection its rulers afforded
the coolie trade.</p>

<p>Eastward from Macao, about forty miles, lies the English
colony of Hongkong, an island in lat. 22° 16&frac12;′ N., and long.
114° 8&frac12;′ E., on the eastern side of the estuary of the Pearl
River. The island of Hongkong, or Hiangkiang (<i>i.e.</i>, the Fragrant
Streams), is nine miles long, eight broad, and twenty-six
in circumference, presenting an exceedingly uneven, barren surface,
consisting for the most part of ranges of hills, with narrow
intervales, and a little level beach land. Victoria Peak is
1,825 feet. Probably not one-twentieth of the surface is availa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>ble
for agricultural purposes. The island and harbor were first
ceded to the Crown of England by the treaty made between
Captain Elliot and Kíshen, in January, 1841, and again by the
treaty of Nanking, in August, 1842; lastly, by the Convention
of Peking, October 24, 1860, the opposite peninsula of Kowlung
was added, in order to furnish space for quartering troops and
storehouse room for naval and military supplies. The town of
Victoria lies on the north side, and extends more than three
miles along the shore. The secure and convenient harbor has
attracted the settlement here, though the uneven nature of the
ground compels the inhabitants to stretch their warehouses and
dwellings along the beach.</p>

<p>The architecture of most of the buildings erected in Victoria
is superior to anything heretofore seen in China. Its population
is now estimated at 130,000, of whom five-sixths are Chinese
tradesmen, craftsmen, laborers, and boatmen, few of whom
have their families. The government of the colony is vested
in a governor, chief-justice, and a legislative council of five,
assisted by various subordinate officers and secretaries, the
whole forming a cumbrous and expensive machinery, compared
with the needs and resources of the colony. The Bishop of
Victoria has an advisory control over the missions of the establishment
in the southern provinces of China, and supervises
the schools in the colony, where many youths are trained in
English and Chinese literature.</p>

<p>The supplies of the island are chiefly brought from the mainland
where an increasing population of Chinese, under the control
of the magistrate of Kowlung, find ample demand for all the
provisions they can furnish.</p>

<p>Three newspapers are published in English, and two in
Chinese. The Seaman’s and Military hospitals, the chapels and
schools of the London and Church Missionary Society, St. John’s
Cathedral, Roman Catholic establishment, the government
house, the magistracy, jail, the ordnance and engineer departments,
Exchange, and the Club house, are among the principal
edifices. The amount of money expended in buildings in this
colony is enormous, and most of them are substantial stone or
brick houses. The view of the city as seen from the harbor is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
only excelled in beauty by the wider panorama spread out before
the spectator on Victoria Peak. During the forty-odd years
of its occupation, this colony has slowly advanced in commercial
importance, and become an entrepôt for foreign goods designed
for native markets in Southern China. Every facility
has been given to the Chinese who resort to its shops to carry
away their purchases, by making the port free of every impost,
and preventing the imperial revenue cutters from interfering
with their junks while in sight of the island. The arrangements
of this contested point so that the Chinese revenue shall
not suffer have not satisfied either party, and as it is in the similar
case of Gibraltar, is not likely to soon be settled. Smugglers
must run their own risks with the imperial officers. The
most valuable article leaving Hongkong is opium, but the
greatest portion of its exports pay the duties on entering China
at the five open ports in the province of Kwangtung. As the
focus of postal lines of passenger steamers, and the port where
mercantile vessels come to learn markets, Hongkong exerts a
greater influence on the southeast of Asia than her trade and
size indicate. The island of Shangchuen or Sançian, where Xavier
died, lies southwest of Macao about thirty miles, and is sometimes
visited by devout persons from that place to reverence
his tomb, which they keep in repair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOWNS OF KWANGTUNG PROVINCE.</div>

<p>The city of Shauchau in the northern part of the province
lies at the fork of the river, which compels a change of boats
for passengers and goods; it is one of the largest cities after
Canton, and a pontoon bridge furnishes the needed facilities for
stopping and taxing the boats and goods passing through.
Shauking, west of Canton, is another important town, which
held out a long time against the Manchus;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> it was formerly the
seat of the provincial authorities, till they removed to Canton
in 1630 to keep the foreigners under control. It stretches
along six miles of the river bank, a well-built city for China, in
a beautiful position. Some of its districts furnish green teas
and matting for the Canton market, and this trade has opened
the way for a large emigration to foreign countries. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
other towns of note is Nanhiung, situated at the head of navigation
on the North River, where goods cross the Mei ling.
Before the coast was opened to trade, fifty thousand porters
obtained a livelihood by transporting packages, passengers, and
merchandise to and from this town and Nan-ngan in Kiangsí.
It is a thriving place, and the restless habits of these industrious
carriers give its population somewhat of a turbulent character.
Many of them are women, who usually pair off by themselves
and carry as heavy burdens as the men.</p>

<p>Not far from Yangshan hien is a fine cavern, the <i>Niu Yen</i>
or ‘Ox Cave,’ on a hillside near the North River. Its entrance
is like a grand hall, with pillars 70 feet high and 8 or 10 feet
thick. The finest part is exposed to the sun, but many pretty
rooms and niches are revealed by torches; echoes resound
through their recesses. The stalactites and stalagmites present
a vast variety of shapes&mdash;some like immense folds of
drapery, between which are lamps, thrones and windows of all
shapes and sizes, while others hang from the roof in fanciful
forms.</p>

<p>The scenery along the river, between Nanhiung and Shauchau,
is described as wild, rugged, and barren in the extreme;
the summits of the mountains seem to touch each other across
the river, and massive fragments fallen from their sides, in and
along the river, indicate that the passage is not altogether free
from danger. In this mountainous region coal is procured by
opening horizontal shafts to the mines. Ellis<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> says, it was
brought some distance to the place where he saw it, to be used
in the manufacture of green vitriol. Many pagodas are passed
in the stretch of 330 miles between Nanhiung and Canton, calculated
to attract notice, and assure the native boatmen which
swarm on its waters, of the protection of the two elements he
has to deal with&mdash;wind and water. One of the most conspicuous
objects in this part of the river are five rocks, which rise
abruptly from the banks, and are fancifully called <i>Wu-ma-tao</i>,
or ‘Five-horses’ heads.’ The formation of this part of the
province consists of compact, dark-colored limestone, overlying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
sandstone and breccia. Nearly halfway between Shauchau and
Canton is a celebrated mountain and cavern temple, dedicated
to Kwanyin, the goddess of Mercy, and most charmingly situated
amid waterfalls, groves, and fine scenery, near a hill about
1,850 feet high. The cliff has a sheer descent of five hundred
feet; the temple is in a fissure a hundred feet above the water,
and consists of two stories; the steps leading up to them, the
rooms, walls, and cells, are all cut out of the rock. Inscriptions
and scrolls hide the naked walls, and a few inane priests inhabit
this somewhat gloomy abode. Mr. Barrow draws a proper comparison
between these men and the inmates of the Cork Convent
in Portugal, or the Franciscan Convent in Madeira, who
had likewise “chained themselves to a rock, to be gnawed by
the vultures of superstition and fanaticism,” but these last have
less excuse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ISLAND OF HAINAN.</div>

<p>The island of Hainan constitutes a single department, Kiungchau,
but its prefect has no power over the central and mountainous
parts. In early European travels it is named Aynao, Kainan
and Aniam. It is about one hundred and fifty miles long and
one hundred broad, being in extent nearly twice the size of
Sicily. It is separated from the main by Luichau Strait, sixteen
miles wide, whose shoals and reefs render its passage uncertain.
The interior of the island is mountainous, and well
wooded, and the inhabitants give a partial submission to the
Chinese; they are identical in race with the mountaineers in
Kweichau. This ridge is called Lí-mu ling; a remarkable
peak in the centre of the southern half, <i>Wu-chi shan</i> or ‘Five-finger
Mountain,’ probably rises 10,000 feet. The Chinese inhabitants
are mostly descendants of emigrants from Fuhkien,
and are either trading, agricultural, marine, or piratical in their
vocation, as they can make most money. The lands along the
coast are fertile, producing areca-nuts, cocoa-nuts, and other
tropical fruits, which are not found on the main. Kiungchau
fu lies at the mouth of the Lí-mu River, opposite Luichau. The
port is Hoihau, nineteen miles distant, but the entrance is too
shallow for most vessels, and the trade consequently seeks a
better market at Pakhoi, a town which has recently risen to
importance as a treaty port on the mainland. All the thirteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
district towns are situated on the coast, and within their circuit,
on Chinese maps, a line is drawn, inclosing the centre of the
island, within which the <i>Lí min</i>, or Lí people live, <i>some</i> of
whom are acknowledged to be independent. They are therefore
known as wild and civilized Lí, and are usually in a state
of chronic irritation from the harsh treatment of the rulers. It
is probable that they originally came from the Malayan Peninsula
(as their features, dress, and habits indicate their affinity
with those tribes), and have gradually withdrawn themselves
into their recesses to avoid oppression. In 1292, the Emperor
Kublai gave twenty thousand of them lands free for a time in
the eastern parts, but the Ming sovereigns found them all intractable
and belligerent. The population of the island is about
a million. Its productions are rice, sweet potatoes, sugar, tobacco,
fruits, timber, and insect wax.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROVINCE OF KWANGSÍ.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Kwangsí</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, Broad West) extends westward
of Kwangtung to the borders of Annam, occupying the
region on the southwest of the Nan ling, and has been seldom
visited by foreigners, whose journeys have been up the Kwai
kiang or ‘Cassia River’ into Hunan. The banks of the rivers
sometimes spread out into plains, more in the eastern parts than
elsewhere, on which an abundance of rice is grown. There are
mines of gold, silver, and other metals, in this province, most
of which are worked under the superintendence of government,
but no data are accessible from which to ascertain the produce.
Among the commercial productions of Kwangsí, are cassia,
cassia-oil, ink-stones, and cabinet-woods; its natural resources
supply the principal articles of trade, for there are no manufactures
of importance. Many partially subdued tribes are found
within the limits of this province, who are ruled by their own
hereditary governors, under the supervision of the Chinese authorities;
there are twenty-four <i>chau</i> districts occupied by these
people, the names of whose head-men are given in the Red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Book, and their position marked in the statistical maps of the
empire, but no information is furnished in either, concerning
the numbers, language, or occupations, of the inhabitants.
Kwangsí is well watered by the West River and its branches,
which enable traders to convey timber and surplus produce to
Canton, and receive from thence salt and other articles. The
mountains on the northwest are occasionally covered with
snow; many of the western districts furnish little besides wood
for buildings and boats. The basin of the West River is subdivided
by ranges of hills into three large valleys, through
which flow many tributaries of the leading streams, and as they
each usually drop the old name on receiving a new affluent, it
is a confusing study to follow them all. On the south the river
Yuh rises near Yunnan, and deflects south to Nan-ning near
the borders of Kwangtung, joining the central trunk at Sinchau,
after a course of five hundred miles. On the north the
river Lung and the Hung-shui receive the surplus drainage
of the northern districts and of Kweichau, a region where the
Miaotsz’ have long kept watch and ward over their hilly abodes.
The waters are then poured into the central trench a few miles
west of Sinchau. This main artery of the province rises in
Yunnan and would connect it by batteaux with Canton City if
the channel were improved; it is called Sz’ ho, and ranks as
the largest tributary of the Pearl River.</p>

<p>The capital, Kweilin (<i>i.e.</i>, Cassia Forest), lies on the Cassia
River, a branch of the West River, in the northeast part of
the province; it is a poorly built city, surrounded by canals and
branches of the river, destitute of any edifices worthy of notice,
and having no great amount of trade. During the Tai-ping rebellion,
this and the next town were nearly destroyed between
the insurgents and imperialists.</p>

<p>Wuchau fu, on the same river, at its junction with the Lung
kiang, or ‘Dragon River,’ where they unite and form the West
River, is the largest trading town in the province. The independent
<i>chau</i> districts are scattered over the southwest near
the frontiers of Annam, and if anything can be inferred from
their position, it may be concluded that they were settled by
Laos tribes, who had been induced, by the comparative security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of life and property within the frontiers, to acknowledge the
Chinese sway.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">KWEICHAU PROVINCE AND THE MIAOTSZ’.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Kweichau</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, Noble Region) is on the
whole the poorest of the eighteen in the character of its inhabitants,
amount of its products, and development of its resources.
A range of mountains passes from the northeast side in a south-westerly
course to Yunnan, forming the watershed between the
valleys of the Yangtsz’ and Siang Rivers, a rough but fertile
region. The western slopes are peopled by Chinese tillers of
the soil, a rude and ignorant race, and rather turbulent; the
eastern districts are largely in the hands of the Miaotsz’, who
are considered by the officials and their troops to be lawful objects
of oppression and destruction. The climate of the province
is regarded as malarious, owing to the quantity of stagnant
water and the impurity of that drawn from wells. Its productions
consist of rice, wheat, musk, insect wax, tobacco, timber,
and cassia, with lead, copper, silver, quicksilver, and iron. The
quicksilver mines are in Kai chau, north of the provincial capital,
and apparently exceed in extent and richness all other
known deposits of this metal; they have been worked for centuries.
Cinnabar occurs at various places, about lat. 27°, in a
belt extending quite across the province, and terminating near
the borders of Yunnan. Two kinds of silk obtained from the
worms which feed on the mulberry and oak, furnish material
for clothing so cheaply that cotton is imported from other provinces.
Horses and other domestic animals are reared in larger
quantities than in the eastern provinces.</p>

<p>The largest river is the Wu, which drains the central and
northern parts of the province, and empties into the Yangtsz’,
through the river Kien near Chungking. Other tributaries of
that river and West River, also have their sources in this province,
and by means of batteaux and rafts are all more or less
available for traffic. The natural outlet for the products of
Kweichau is the river Yuen in Hunan, whose various branches
flow into it from the eastern prefectures, but their unsettled
condition prevents regular or successful intercourse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<p>The capital, Kweiyang, is situated among the mountains; it
is the smallest provincial capital of the eighteen, its walls not
being more than two miles in circumference. The other chief
towns or departments are of inferior note. There are many
military stations in the southern prefectures at the foot of the
mountains, intended to restrain the unsubdued tribes of Miaotsz’
who inhabit them.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Miaotsz’ Types.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This name Miaotsz’ is used among the Chinese as a general
term for all the dwellers upon these mountains, but is not applied
to every clan by the people themselves. They consist of
eighty-two tribes in all (found scattered over the mountains in
Kwangtung, Hunan, and Kwangsí, as well as in Kweichau),
speaking several dialects, and differing among themselves in
their customs, government, and dress. The Chinese have often
described and pictured these people, but the notices are confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to a list of their divisions, and an account of their most striking
peculiarities. Their language differs entirely from the Chinese,
but too little is known of it to ascertain its analogies to other
tongues; its affinities are most likely with the Laos, and those
tribes between Burmah, Siam, and China. One clan, inhabiting
Lípo hien in the extreme south, is called <i>Yau-jin</i>, and
although they occasionally come down to Canton to trade, the
citizens of that place firmly believe them to be furnished with
short tails like monkeys. They carry arms, are inclined to live
at peace with the lowlanders, but resist every attempt to penetrate
into their fastnesses. The Yau-jin first settled in Kwangsí,
and thence passed over into Lien chau about the twelfth century,
where they have since maintained their footing. Both
sexes wear their hair braided in a tuft on the top of the head&mdash;but
never shaven and tressed as the Chinese&mdash;and dress in
loose garments of cotton and linen; earrings are in universal
use among them. They live at strife among themselves, which
becomes a source of safety to the Chinese, who are willing
enough to harass and oppress, but are ill able to resist, these
hardy mountaineers. In 1832, they broke out in active hostilities,
and destroyed numerous parties of troops sent to subdue
them, but were finally induced to return to their retreats
by offers of pardon and largesses granted to those who submitted.</p>

<p>A Chinese traveller among the Miaotsz’ says that some of
them live in huts constructed upon the branches of trees, others
in mud hovels; and one tribe in cliff houses dug out of the hillsides,
sometimes six hundred feet up. Their agriculture is
rude, and their garments are obtained by barter from the lowlanders
in exchange for metals and grain, or woven by themselves.
The religious observances of these tribes are carefully
noted, and whatever is connected with marriages and funerals.
In one tribe, it is the custom for the father of a new-born child,
as soon as its mother has become strong enough to leave her
couch, to get into bed himself and there receive the congratulations
of his acquaintances, as he exhibits his offspring&mdash;a custom
which has been found among the Tibetan tribes and elsewhere.
Another class has the counterpart of the may-pole and its jocund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
dance, which, like its corresponding game, is availed of by
young men to select their mates.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROVINCE OF YUNNAN.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Yunnan</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, Cloudy South&mdash;south of the
<i>Yun ling</i>, or ‘Cloudy Mountains’<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>) is in the southwest of the
empire, bounded north by Sz’chuen, east by Kweichau and
Kwangsí, south by Annam, Laos, and Siam, and west by Burmah.
Its distance from the central authority of the Empire
since its partial conquest under the Han dynasty has always made
it a weak point, and the uneducated, mixed character of the inhabitants
has given an advantage to enterprising leaders to
resist Chinese rule. It was recovered from the aborigines by
the Tang Emperors, who called it Jung chau, or the region of
the Jung tribes, from which the name <i>Karajang</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, Black
Jung, which Marco Polo calls it, is derived; Kublai Khan
himself led an army in 1253 thither before he conquered China,
and sent the Venetians on a mission there about the year 1278,
after his establishment at Peking. A son of the Emperor was
his Viceroy over this outlying province at that time. The recent
travels of Margary, Baber, and Anderson, of the British
service, with Mouhot and Garnier of the French, have done
much to render this secluded province better known. The central
portion is occupied by an extensive plateau, ramifying in
various directions and intersected with valley-plains at altitudes
of 5,000 to 6,000 feet, in which lie several large lakes and
the seven principal cities in the province. These plains are
overtopped by the ridges separating them, which, seen from the
lower levels, appear, as in Shansí, like horizontal, connected
summit-lines. All are built up of red sandstone, like the basin
in Sz’chuen, through which rivers, small and large, have furrowed
their beds hundreds and thousands of feet, rendering
communication almost impossible in certain directions as soon
as one leaves the plateau. In the east and northwest, the defiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
are less troublesome, and in this latter portion of the province
are some peaks rising far above the snow line. These are called
on Col. Yule’s map the <i>Goolan Sigon</i> range. The climate is
cooler than in Sz’chuen, owing to this elevation, and not very
healthy; snow lies for weeks at Yunnan fu, and the summers
are charming.</p>

<p>The Yangtsz’ enters the province on the northwest for a
short distance. The greatest river in it is the Lantsan, which
rises in Tibet, and runs for a long distance parallel with and
between the Yangtsz’ and Nu Rivers till the three break
through the mountains not far from each other, and take different
courses,&mdash;the largest turning to the eastward across China,
the Lantsan southeast through Yunnan to the gulf of Siam,
under the name of the Meikon or river of Cambodia, and the
third, or Salween, westerly through Burmah. The Meikon receives
many large tributaries in its course across the province,
and its entire length is not less than 1,500 miles. The Lungchuen,
a large affluent of the Irrawadi, runs a little west of the
Salween. The Meinam rises in Yunnan, and flows south into
Siam under the name of the Nanting, and after a course of nearly
eight hundred miles, empties into the sea below Bangkok.
East of the Lantsan are several important streams, of which
three that unite in Annam to form the Sangkoi, are the largest.
The general course of these rivers is southeasterly, and their
upper waters are separated by mountain ridges, between which
the valleys are often reduced to very narrow limits. There are
two lakes in the eastern part of the province, south of the capital,
called Sien and Tien; the latter is about seventy miles
long by twenty wide, and the Sien hu (<i>i.e.</i>, ‘Fairy Lake’) about
two-thirds as large. Another sheet of water in the northwest,
near Talí fu, communicating with the Yangtsz’ kiang, is called
Urh hai or Uhr sea, which is more than a hundred miles long,
and about twenty in width.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INHABITANTS AND PRODUCTIONS OF YUNNAN.</div>

<p>The capital, Yunnan, lies upon the north shore of Lake Tien,
and is a town of note, having, moreover, considerable political
importance from its trade with other parts of the country
through the Yangtsz’, and with Burmah. The city was seriously
injured in 1834, by an earthquake, which is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
lasted three entire days, forcing the inhabitants into tents or
the open fields, and overthrowing every important building.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
The traffic between this province and Burmah centres at the
fortified post of Tsantah, in the district of Tăngyueh, both of
them situated on a branch of the Irrawadi. The principal part
of the commodities is transported upon animals from these
dépôts to Bhamo, upon the Irrawadi, the largest market-town in
this part of Chin-India. The Chinese participate largely in
this trade, which consists of raw and manufactured silk to the
amount of $400,000 annually, tea, copper, carpets, orpiment,
quicksilver, vermilion, drugs, fruits, and other things, carried
from their country in exchange for raw cotton to the amount
of $1,140,000 annually, ivory, wax, rhinoceros and deer’s horns,
precious stones, birds’ nests, peacocks’ feathers, and foreign articles.
The entire traffic is probably $2,500,000 annually, and
for a few years past has been regularly increasing.</p>

<p>There is considerable intercourse and trade on the southern
frontiers with the Lolos, or Laos and Annamese,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> partly by
means of the head-waters of the Meinam and Meikon&mdash;which
are supposed to communicate with each other by a natural
canal&mdash;and partly by caravans over the mountains. Yunnan
fu was the capital of a Chinese prince about the time of the
decadence of the Ming dynasty, who had rendered himself independent
in this part of their empire by the overthrow of the
rebel Lí, but having linked his fortunes with an imbecile scion
of that house, he displeased his officers, and his territories
gradually fell under the sway of the conquering Manchus.
The southern and western districts of the province are inhabited
by half-subdued tribes who are governed by their own
rulers, under the nominal sway of the Chinese, and pass and
repass across the frontiers in pursuit of trade or occupation.</p>

<p>The extension of British trade from Rangoon toward this
part of China, has brought those hill tribes more into notice,
and proved in their present low and barbarous condition the accuracy
of the ancient description by Marco Polo and the Roman
Catholic missionaries. Colonel Yule aptly terms this wide re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>gion
an “Ethnological Garden of tribes of various race and
in every stage of uncivilization.” The unifying influence of
the Chinese written language and literary institutions has been
neutralized among these races by their tribal dissensions and
inaptitude for study of any kind. Anderson gives short vocabularies
of the Kakhyen, Shan, Hotha Shan, Le-sau and
Poloung languages, all indicating radical differences of origin,
the existence of which would keep them from mingling with
each other as well as from the Chinese.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The mineral wealth of Yunnan is greater and more varied
than that of any other province, certain of the mines having
been worked since the Sung dynasty. Coal occurs in many
places on the borders of the central plateau; some of it is
anthracite of remarkable solidity and uniformity. Salt occurs
in hills, not in wells as in Sz’chuen; the brine is sometimes
obtained by driving tunnels into the hillsides. Metalliferous
ores reach from this province into the three neighboring ones.
Copper is the most abundant, and the mines in Ningyuen fu, in
the southwestern part of Sz’chuen, have supplied both copper
and zinc ores during the troubles in Yunnan. The copper at
Hwuilí-chau in that prefecture is worked by companies which
pay a royalty of two taels a pecul to the government, and furnish
the metal to the mine owners for $8 per pecul. The <i>pehtung</i>
or argentan ores are mixed with copper, tin, or lead, by
the manufacturers according to the uses the alloys are put to.
Silver exists in several places in the north, and the exploitation
of the mines was successful until within 30 years past; now
they cannot be safely or profitably worked, in consequence of
political disturbances. Gold is obtained in the sand of some
rivers but not to a large extent; lead, iron, tin, and zinc occur
in such plenty that they can be exported, but no data are accessible
as to the entire product or export.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF MANCHURIA, MONGOLIA, ÍLÍ, AND TIBET.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The portions of the Chinese Empire beyond the limits of the
Eighteen Provinces, though of far greater extent than China
Proper, are comparatively of minor importance. Their vast regions
are peopled by different races, whose languages are mutually
unintelligible, and whose tribes are held together under
the Chinese sway rather by interest and reciprocal hostilities or
dislike, than by force. European geographers have vaguely
termed all that space lying north of Tibet to Siberia, and east
of the Tsung ling to the Pacific, <i>Chinese Tartary</i>; while the
countries west of the Tsung ling or Belur tag, to the Aral Sea,
have been collectively called <i>Independent Tartary</i>. Both these
names have already become nearly obsolete on good maps of
those regions; the more accurate knowledge brought home by
recent travellers having ascertained that their inhabitants are
neither all Tartars (or Mongols) nor Turks, and further that
the native names and divisions are preferable to a single comprehensive
one. Such names as Manchuria, Mongolia, Songaria,
and Turkestan, derived from the leading tribes dwelling in
those countries, are more definite, though these are not permanent,
owing to the migratory, changeable habits of the people.
From their ignorance of scientific geography, the Chinese have
no general designations for extensive countries, long chains of
mountains, or devious rivers, but apply many names where, if
they were better informed, they would be content with one.</p>

<p>The following table presents a general view of these countries,
giving their leading divisions and forms of government.
They cannot be classed, however, in the same manner as the
provinces, nor are the divisions and capitals here given to be
regarded as definitely settled. Their united area is 3,951,130
square miles, or a little more than all Europe; their separate
areas cannot be precisely given. Manchuria contains about
400,000 square miles; Mongolia between 1,300,000 and 1,500,000
square miles; Ílí about 1,070,000 square miles; and Tibet
from 500,000 to 700,000 square miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXTENT OF MANCHURIA.</div>

<p><i>Manchuria</i> is so termed from the leading race who dwell
there, the <i>Mandjurs</i> or <i>Manchus</i>; it is a word of foreign
origin, the Chinese having no general appellation for the vice-royalty
ruled from Mukden. It comprises the eastern portion
of the high table land of Central Asia, and lies between latitudes
39° and 52° N., and longitudes 120° to 134° E. These
points include the limits in both directions, giving the region a
rectangular shape lying in a north-east and south-west direction;
roughly speaking, its dimensions are 800 by 500 miles. It is
bounded on the south by the Gulf of Pechele, and the highlands
of Corea on the north bank of the Yaluh River; on the east
by a line running from the Russian town of Possiet northerly
to the River Usuri, so as to include Hinka Lake; thence from
its headwaters to its junction with the Amur. This river forms
the northern frontier; its tributary, the River Argun, together
with the large lakes Hurun and Puyur, lie on the west; from
the latter lake an artificial line stretching nearly due east for
six degrees in lat. 47° strikes the town of Tsitsihar on the
River Nonni. The rest of the western border follows the rivers
Nonni and Songari to the Palisade. This obsolete boundary
commences at Shan-hai kwan on the Gulf of Liatung and runs
north-easterly; it nominally separates the Mongols from the
Manchus for nearly 300 miles, and really exists only at the
passes where the roads are guarded by military.</p>

<p>But a portion of this region has yet been traversed by Europeans,
and most of it is a wilderness. The entire population is
not stated in the census of 1812, and from the nature of the
country and wandering habits of the people, many tribes of
whom render no allegiance to the Emperor, it would be impossible
to take a regular census. Parts of Manchuria, as here de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>fined,
have been known under many names at different periods.
<i>Liautung</i> (‘East of the River Liau’) has been applied to the country
between that river, Corea, and the Sea of Japan; <i>Tungking</i>
(‘Eastern Capital’) referred to the chief town of that region,
under the Ming dynasty; and <i>Kwantung</i> (‘East of the Pass’),
denoting the same country, is still a common designation for the
whole territory.</p>

<p>Manchuria is now chiefly comprised in the valleys between
the Usuri and Nonni Rivers, up to the Amur on the north,
while the basin of the Liau on the south embraces the rest.
There are three principal mountain chains. Beginning nearly
a hundred miles east of Mukden, in lat. 43°, are the Long White
Mountains<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> (<i>Chang-peh shan</i> of the Chinese, or <i>Kolmin-shang-uin
alin</i> of the Manchus), which form the watershed between
the Songari and Yaluh Rivers and serve for the northern
frontier of Corea as far as Russian territory. There it divides
and takes the name of Sih-hih-teh, or Sihoti Mountains, for the
eastern spur which runs near the ocean, east of the River Usuri;
and the name of Hurkar Mountains for the western and lower
spurs between that river and the Hurkar. One noted peak,
called Mount Chakoran, rising over 10,000 feet, lies south-east
of San-săng on the Amur. On the plain, north of Kirin,
numerous buttes occur, sometimes isolated, and often in lines
fifteen or twenty miles apart; most of them are wooded.</p>

<p>In the western part of Tsitsihar lies the third great range of
mountains in Manchuria, called the Sialkoi Mountains, a continuation
of the Inner Hing-an range of Mongolia, and separating
the Argun and Nonni basins. The Sialkoi range extends over
a great part of Mongolia, commencing near the bend of the Yellow
River, and reaching in a north-easterly direction, it forms
in Manchuria three sides of the extensive valley of the Nonni,
ending between the Amur and Songari Rivers at their junction.
These regions are more arid than the eastern portions, and
the mountains are rather lower; but our information is vague
and scanty. As a whole, Manchuria should be called hilly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
rather than mountainous, its intervales alone repaying cultivation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE AMUR AND ITS AFFLUENTS.</div>

<p>The country north of the Chang-peh shan as far as the Stanovoi
Mountains is drained by one river, viz., the Sagalien, Amur,
Kwăntung, or Hehlung kiang (for it is known by all these
names), and its affluents; <i>Sagalien ula</i> in Manchu and <i>Hehlung
kiang</i> in Chinese, each mean ‘Black’ or ‘Black Dragon River.’
The Amur drains the north-eastern slope of Central Asia by a
circuitous course, aided by many large tributaries. Its source
is in lat. 50° N. and long. 111° E., in a spur of the Daourian
Mountains, called Kenteh, where it is called the Onon.
After an east and north-east course of nearly five hundred miles,
the Onon is joined in long. 115° E. by the Ingoda, a stream
coming from the east of Lake Baikal, where it takes its rise by a
peak called Tshokondo, the highest of the Yablonsi Khrebet
Mountains. Beyond this junction, under the Russian name of
Shilka, it flows about two hundred and sixty miles north-east
till it meets the Argun. The Argun rises about three degrees
south of the Onon, on the south side of the Kenteh, and under
the name of Kerlon runs a solitary north-east course for four
hundred and thirty miles to Lake Hurun, Kerlon, or Dalai-nur;
the Kalka here comes in from Lake Puyur or Pir, and their
waters leave Lake Hurun at Ust-Strelotchnoi (the Arrow’s Mouth)
under the name of the Argun, flowing north nearly four hundred
miles to the union with the Shilka in lat. 53°; from its
exit as the Argun and onward to the entrance of the Usuri, it
forms the boundary between China and Russia for 1,593 versts,
or 1,062 miles.</p>

<p>Beyond this town the united stream takes the name of the
Amur (<i>i.e.</i>, Great River) or Sagalien of the Manchus, running
nearly east about 550 miles beyond Albazin, when its course is
south-east till it joins the Songari. Most of the affluents are on
the north bank; the main channel grows wider as its size increases,
having so many islands and banks as seriously to interfere
with navigation. The valley thus watered possesses great
natural advantages in soil, climate, and productions, which are
now gradually attracting Russian settlers. In lat. 47&frac12;° the
Songari River (<i>Sung-hwa kiang</i> of the Chinese) unites with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Amur on the right bank, 950 miles from Ust-Strelotchnoi,
bringing the drainings of the greater portion of Manchuria,
and doubling the main volume of water. The headwaters of
this stream issue from the northern slopes of the Chang-peh
shan; quickly combined in a single channel, these waters flow
past the town of Kirin, scarcely a hundred miles from the
mountains, in a river twelve feet deep and 900 wide. Near Petuné
the River Nonni joins it from Tsitsihar, and their united
stream takes the Chinese name of Kwantung (‘Mingled Union’);
it is a mile and a half wide here and only three or four feet
deep, a sluggish river full of islands. Then going east by north,
growing deeper by its affluents, the Hurka, Mayen, Tunni,
Hulan, and other smaller ones, it unites with the Amur at
Changchu, a hundred miles west from the Usuri. All accounts
agree in giving the Songari the superiority. At Sansing,
it is a deep and rapid river, but further down islands and
banks interfere with the navigation. The Hurka drains the
original country of the Manchus.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The district south-east of the desert, and north of the Great
Wall, is drained and fertilized by the Sira-muren, or Liau
River, which is nearly valueless for navigation. Its main and
western branch divides near the Ín shan Mountains into the
Hwang ho and Lahar; the former rises near the Pecha peak,
a noted point in those mountains. The Sira-muren runs
through a dry region for nearly 400 miles before it turns south,
and in a zigzag channel reaches the Gulf of Liautung, a powerful
stream carrying its quota of deposit into the ocean; the
width at Yingtsz’ is 650 feet. The depth is 16 feet on the bar
at high tide. The Yaluh kiang, nearly three hundred miles
long, runs in a very crooked channel along the northern frontiers
of Corea. But little is known about the two lakes, Hurun and
Pir, except that their waters are fresh and full of fish; the
River Urshun unites them, and several smaller streams run into
the latter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">NATURAL RESOURCES OF MANCHURIA.</div>

<p>The larger part of Manchuria is covered by forests, the
abode of wild animals, whose capture affords employment,
clothing, and food to their hunters. The rivers and coasts
abound in fish; among which carp, sturgeon, salmon, pike, and
other species, as well as shell-fish, are plenty; the pearl-fishery
is sufficiently remunerative to employ many fishermen; the
Chinese Government used to take cognizance of their success,
and collect a revenue in kind. The argali and jiggetai are
found here as well as in Mongolia; bears, wolves, tigers, deer,
and numerous fur-bearing animals are hunted for their skins.
The troops are required to furnish 2,400 stags annually to the
Emperor, who reserves for his own use only the fleshy part of
the tail as a delicacy. Larks, pheasants, and crows of various
species, with pigeons, thrushes, and grouse, abound. The condor
is the largest bird of prey, and for its size and fierceness rivals
its congener of the Andes.</p>

<p>The greater half of Shingking and the south of Kirin is cultivated;
maize, Setaria wheat, barley, pulse, millet, and buckwheat
are the principal crops. Ginseng and rhubarb are collected
by troops sent out in detachments under the charge of
their proper officers. These sections support, moreover, large
herds of various domestic animals. The timber which covers
the mountains will prove a source of wealth as soon as a remunerative
market stimulates the skill and enterprise of settlers;
even now, logs over three feet in diameter find their way up to
Peking, brought from the Liau valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROVINCE OF SHINGKING.</div>

<p>Manchuria is divided into three provinces, <i>Shingking</i>, <i>Kirin</i>,
and <i>Tsitsihar</i>. The province of <span class="smcap">Shingking</span> includes the ancient
Liautung, and is bounded north by Mongolia; north-east and
east by Kirin; south by the Gulf of Liautung and Corea, from
which latter it is separated by the Yaluh River; and west by
Chahar in Chihlí. It contains two departments, viz., Fungtien
and Kinchau, subdivided into fifteen districts; there are also
twelve garrisoned posts at the twelve gates in the Palisade,
whose inmates collect a small tax on travellers and goods. Manchuria
is under a strictly military government, every male above
eighteen being liable for military service, and being, in fact,
enrolled under that one of the eight standards to which by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
birth he belongs. The administration of Shingking is partly
civil and partly military; that of Kirin and Tsitsihar is entirely
military.</p>

<p>The population of the province has been estimated by T. T.
Meadows<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> at twelve millions, consisting of Manchus and Chinese.
The coast districts are now mostly occupied and cultivated
by emigrants from Shantung, who are pushing the Manchus
toward the Amur, or compelling them to leave their hunting
and take to farming if they wish to stay where they were born.
The conquerors are being civilized and developed by their subjects,
losing the use of their own meagre language, and becoming
more comfortable as they learn to be industrious. But few
aboriginal settlements now remain who still resist these influences.
The inhabitants collect near the river, or along the great
roads, where food or a market are easiest found.</p>

<p>The capital of Shingking is usually known on the spot as
Shin-yang, an older name than the Manchu Mukden, or the
Chinese name Fungtien. As the metropolis of Manchuria, it is
also known as Shingking (the ‘Affluent Capital’), distinguished
from the name of the province by the addition of <i>pun-ching</i>, or
‘head-garrison.’ It lies in lat. 41° 50&frac12;′ N. and long. 123° 30′
E., on the banks of the Shin, a small branch of the Liau, and is
reckoned to be five hundred miles north-east from Peking. The
town is surrounded by a low mud wall about ten miles in circuit,
at least half a mile distant from the main city wall, whose
eight gates have double archways so that the crowd may not
interfere in passing; this wall is about three miles around, and
its towers and bastions are in good condition. It is 35 or 40 feet
high, and 15 feet wide at the top, of brick throughout; a crenulated
parapet protects the guard. But for its smaller scale, the
walls and buildings here are precisely similar to those at Peking.
The streets are wide, clean, and the main business avenues lined
with large, well built shops, their counters, windows, and other
arrangements indicating a great trade. This capital contains
a large proportion of governmental establishments, <i>yamuns</i>,
and nearly all the officials belong to the ruling race. Main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
streets run across the city from gate to gate, with narrow
roads or <i>hu-tung</i> intersecting them. The palace of the early
Manchu sovereigns occupies the centre; while the large warehouses
are outside of the inner city. Everywhere marks of
prosperity and security indicate an enterprising population, and
for its tidy look, industrious and courteous population, Mukden
takes high rank among Chinese cities. Its population is estimated
to be under 200,000, mostly Chinese. The Manchu
monarchs made it the seat of their government in 1631, and
the Emperors have since done everything in their power to
enlarge and beautify it. The Emperor Kienlung rendered
himself celebrated among his subjects, and made the city of
Mukden better known abroad, by a poetical eulogy upon the
city and province, which was printed in sixty-four different
forms of Chinese writing. This curious piece of imperial
vanity and literary effort was translated into French by Amyot.</p>

<p>The town of Hingking,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> sixty miles east of it, is one of the
favored places in Shingking, from its being the family residence
of the Manchu monarchs, and the burial-ground of their ancestors.
It is pleasantly situated in an elevated valley, the tombs
being three miles north of it upon a mountain called <i>Tsz’yun
shan</i>. The circuit of the walls is about three miles. Hingking
lies near the Palisade which separates the province from Kirin,
and its officers have the rule over the surrounding country, and
the entrances into that province. It has now dwindled to a
small hamlet, and the guards connected with the tombs comprise
most of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Kinchau, fifteen leagues from Mukden, carries on considerable
trade in cattle, pulse, and drugs. Gutzlaff<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> describes the
harbor as shallow, and exposed to southern gales; the houses
in the town are built of stone, the environs well cultivated and
settled by Chinese from Shantung, while natives of Fuhkien
conduct the trade. The Manchus lead an idle life, but keep
on good terms with the Chinese. When he was there in 1832,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the authorities had ordered all the females to seclude themselves
in order to put a stop to debauchery among the native
sailors. Horses and camels are numerous and cheap, but the
carriages are clumsy. Kaichau, another port lying on the east
side of the gulf, possesses a better harbor, but is not so much
frequented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRADE AND CLIMATE OF MANCHURIA.</div>

<p>Since the treaty of 1858 opened the port of Niuchwang or
Yingtsz’, on the River Liau, to foreign trade, the development
of Shingking has rapidly increased. The trade in pulse and
bean-cake and oil employs many vessels annually. Opium,
silk, and paper are prepared for export through this mart, besides
foreign goods. Fung-hwang ting, lying near the Yaluh
River, commands all the trade with Corea, which must pass
through it. There are many restrictions upon this intercourse
by both governments, and the Chinese forbid their subjects
passing the frontiers. The trade is conducted at fairs, under
the supervision of officers and soldiers; the short time allowed
for concluding the bargains, and the great numbers resorting to
them, render these bazaars more like the frays of opposing clans
than the scenes of peaceable trade. There is a market-town in
Corea itself, called Kí-iu wăn, about four leagues from the
frontier, where the Chinese “supply the Coreans with dogs,
cats, pipes, leather, stags’ horns, copper, horses, mules, and
asses; and receive in exchange, baskets, kitchen utensils, rice,
corn, swine, paper, mats, oxen, furs, and small horses.” Merchants
are allowed not more than four or five hours in which
to conduct this fair, and the Corean officers under whose charge
it is placed, drive all strangers back to the frontier as soon as
the day closes.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The borders of the sea consist of alluvial soil, efflorescing
a nitrous white salt near the beach, but very fertile inland,
well cultivated and populous. Beyond, the hill-country is extremely
picturesque. Ever-changing views, torrents and fountains,
varied and abounding vegetation, flocks of black cattle
grazing on the hillsides, goats perched on the overhanging crags,
horses, asses, and sheep lower down in the intervales, numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
well-built hamlets, everywhere enliven the scene. The department
of Kinchau lies along the Gulf of Liautung, between the
Palisade and the sea, and contains four small district towns,
with forts, around whose garrisons of agricultural troops have
collected a few settlers. On the south, toward Chihlí and the
Wall, the country is better cultivated.</p>

<p>The climate of Manchuria, as a whole, is healthy and moderate,
far removed from the rigor of the plateau on its west, and
not so moist as the outlying islands on the east. In summer
the ranges are 70° to 90° F., thence down to 10° or 20° below
zero. The rivers remain frozen from December nearly to
April, and the fall of snow is less than in Eastern America.
The seasons are really six weeks of spring, five months of summer,
six weeks of autumn and four months of winter; the last
is in some respects the enjoyable period, and is used by the
farmers to bring produce to market. If the houses were
tighter, their inmates would suffer little during the cold season.
Huc speaks of hail storms which killed flocks of sheep in Mongolia,
near Chahar. Darwin (<cite>Naturalist’s Voyage</cite>, 2d ed., 1845,
p. 115) corroborates the possibility of his statement by a somewhat
similar experience near Buenos Ayres. He here saw many
deer and other wild animals killed by “hail as large as small
apples and extremely hard.” Of the denuded country, near the
Liau River, Abbé Huc says: “Although it is uncertain where
God placed paradise, we may be sure that he chose some other
country than Liautung; for of all savage regions, this takes a
distinguished rank for the aridity of the soil and rigor of the
climate. On his entrance, the traveller remarks the barren
aspect of most of the hills, and the nakedness of the plains,
where not a tree nor a thicket, and hardly a slip of a herb is to
be seen. The natives are superior to any Europeans I have
ever seen for their powers of eating; beef and pork abound on
their tables, and I think dogs and horses, too, under some other
name; rich people eat rice, the poor are content with boiled
millet, or with another grain called <i>hac-bam</i>, about thrice the
size of millet and tasting like wheat, which I never saw elsewhere.
The vine is cultivated, but must be covered from October
to April; the grapes are so watery that a hundred litres of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
juice produce by distillation only forty of poor spirit. The
leaves of an oak are used to rear wild silkworms, and this is a
considerable branch of industry. The people relish the worms
as food after the cocoons have been boiled, drawing them out
with a pin, and sucking the whole until nothing but the pellicle
is left.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Another says, the ground freezes seven feet in Kirin,
and about three in Shingking; the thermometer in winter is
thirty degrees below zero. The snow is raised into the air
by the north-east winds, and becomes so fine that it penetrates
the clothes, houses, and enters even the lungs. When
travelling, the eyebrows become a mass of ice, the beard a large
flake, and the eyelashes are frozen together; the wind cuts and
pierces the skin like razors or needles. The earth is frozen
during eight months, but vegetation in summer is rapid, and
the streams are swollen by the thawing drifts of snow.</p>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Kirin</span>, or Girin, comprises the country north-east
of Shingking, as far as the Amur and Usuri, which bound
it on the north and east, while Corea and Shingking lie on the
south-east (better separated by the Chang-peh shan than any
political confine) and Mongolia on the west. All signs of the line
of palisades have disappeared (save at the Passes) in the entire
<i>trajet</i> between the Songari and Shan-hai kwan. The region is
mountainous, except in the link of that river after the Nonni
joins it till the Usuri comes in, measuring about one-fourth of
the whole. This extensive region is thinly inhabited by Manchus
settled in garrisons along the bottoms of the rivers, by
Goldies, Mangoons, Ghiliaks, and tribes having affinity with
them, who subsist principally by hunting and fishing, and acknowledge
their fealty by a tribute of peltry, but who have no
officers of government placed over them. Du Halde calls them
<i>Kíching Tatse</i>, <i>Yupí Tatse</i>, and other names, which seem, indeed,
to have been their ancient designations. The <i>Yu-pí Tahtsí</i>,
or ‘Fish-skin Tartars,’<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> are said to inhabit the extensive valley
of the Usuri, and do not allow the subjects of the Emperor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
live among them. In winter they nestle together in kraals like
the Bushmen, and subsist upon the products of their summer’s
fishing, having cut down fuel enough to last them till warm
weather. Shut out, as they have been during the past, from all
elevating influences, these people are likely to be ere long amalgamated
and lost, as well among Russian and other settlers coming
in from the north, as amid the Chinese immigrants who occupy
their land in the south. The entire population of this province
cannot be reckoned, from present information, as high as three
millions, the greater part of which live along the Songari valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOWNS AND PRODUCTIONS OF KIRIN PROVINCE.</div>

<p>Kirin is divided into three ruling <i>ting</i> departments or commanderies,
viz., Kirin ula, or the garrison of Kirin, Petuné or
Pedné, and Changchun ting. Kirin, the largest of the three, is
subdivided into eight garrison districts. The town, called
<i>Chuen Chwang</i>, or ‘Navy Yard,’ in Chinese, is finely situated
on the Songari, in lat. 43° 45′ N., and long. 127° 25′ E., at the
foot of encircling hills, where the river is a thousand feet wide.
The streets are narrow and irregular, the shops low and small,
and much ground in the city is unoccupied. Two great streets
cross each other at right angles, one of them running far into
the river on the west supported by piles. The highways are
paved with wooden blocks, and adorned with flowers, gold fish,
and squares; its population is about 50,000.</p>

<p>The four other important places in Kirin are Petuné, Larin,
Altchuku, or A-shi-ho, and Sansing, the latter at the confluent of
the Songari and Hurka. Altchuku is the largest, and Petuné
next in size, each town having not far from 35,000 inhabitants;
Larin is perhaps half as large, and like the others steadily increasing
in numbers and importance. Ninguta on the river Hurka
has wide regions under its sway where ginseng is gathered; near
the stockaded town is a subterranean body of water that furnishes
large fish. A great and influential portion of the Chinese
population is Moslem, but no Manchus reside in the place.
The former control trade and travel in every town.</p>

<p>Petuné, in lat. 45° 20′ N., and long. 125° 10′ E., is inhabited
by troops and many persons banished from China for their
crimes. Its favorable position renders it a place of considerable
trade, and during the summer months it is a busy mart for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
these thinly peopled regions. It consists of two main streets,
with the chief market at their crossing. A large mosque attracts
attention. The third commandery of Changchun, west
of Kirin and south of Petuné, just beyond the Palisade, is a
mere post for overseeing the Manchus and Mongols passing to
and fro on the edge of the steppe.</p>

<p>The resources of this wide domain in timber, minerals, metals,
cattle and grain have not yet been explored or developed. The
hills are wooded to the top, the bottoms bring forth two crops
annually, and the rivers take down timber and grain to the
Russian settlers. Sorghum, millet, barley, maize, pulse, indigo,
and tobacco are the chief crops; and latterly opium, which has
rapidly extended, because it pays well. Oil and whiskey are extensively
manufactured, packed in wicker baskets lined with
paper and transported on wheelbarrows. The wild and domestic
animals are numerous. Among the latter the hogs and mules,
more than any other kind, furnish food and transportation;
while tigers, panthers, and leopards, bears, wolves, and foxes
reward the hunters for their pains in killing them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROVINCE OF TSI-TSI-HAR.</div>

<p>The province of <span class="smcap">Tsi-tsi-har</span>, or Hehlung kiang, comprises the
northwest of Manchuria, extending four hundred miles from
east to west, and about five hundred from north to south. It is
bounded north by the Amur, from Shilka to its junction with
the Songari; east and southeast by Kirin, from which the
Songari partly separates it; southwest by Mongolia, and west
by the River Argun, dividing it from Russia. The greatest part
of it is occupied by the valley of the Nonni, Noun or Nún; its
area of about two hundred thousand square miles is mostly an
uninhabited, mountainous wilderness. It is divided into six
commanderies, viz.: Tsitsihar, Hulan, Putek, Merguen, Sagalien
ula, and Hurun-pir, whose officers have control over the
tribes within their limits; of these, Sagalien or Igoon is the
chief town in the northeast districts, and is used by the government
of Peking as a penal settlement. The town stands on a
plain but a rood or so above the river, which sweeps off to the
mountains in the distance. Here is posted a large force of officers
and men, their extensive barracks indicating the importance
attached to the place. The garrison has gradually attracted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
population of natives and Chinese from the south, who live by
fishing and hunting, as well as farming.</p>

<p>Tsitsihar, the capital of the province, lies on the River
Nonni, in lat. 47° 20′ N., and long. 124° E., and is a place of some
trade, resorted to by the tribes near the river. Merguen, Hurun-pir,
and Hulan are situated upon rivers, and accessible when
the waters are free from ice. Tsitsihar was built in 1692 by
Kanghí to overawe the neighboring tribes. It is inclosed by a
stockade and a ditch. The one-storied houses are constructed
of logs, or of brick stuccoed, where timber is dear, and warmed
by the brick beds; the tall chimneys outside the main buildings
give a peculiar appearance to villages. Pulse, maize, tobacco,
millet, and wheat, and latterly poppy are common crops. The
valley of the Nonni is cultivated by the Taguri Manchus, among
whom six thousand six hundred families of Yakutes settled in
1687, when they emigrated from Siberia. The Korchin Mongols
occupy the country south and west of this valley. Some
of its streams produce large pearls. The region lying between
the Sialkoi Mountains and the River Argun is rough and sterile,
presenting few inducements to agriculturalists. Fish abound
in all the rivers, and furs are sought in the hills. Pasturage is
excellent in the bottoms. Fairs, between the natives and Cossacks,
are constantly held at convenient places on the Argun
and other rivers. The racial distinction between the Mongols
and Manchus is here seen in the agricultural labors of the latter,
so opposed to the nomadic habits of the former. This
region has, within the last half century, attracted Chinese settlers
from Shantung and Chihlí. These colonists are fast filling
up the vacant lands along the rivers, dispossessing the Manchus
by their thrift and industry, and making the country far more
valuable. They will in this way secure its possession to the
Peking Government, and bring it, by degrees, under Chinese
control, greatly to the benefit of all. In early days the policy
of the Manchus, like that of the E. I. Company in India towards
British immigration, discountenanced the entrance of Chinese
settlers, and in both cases to the disadvantage of the ruling
power.</p>

<p>The administration of Manchuria consists of a supreme civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
government at Mukden, and three provincial military ones,
though Shingking is under both civil and military. There are
five Boards, each under a president, whose duties are analogous
to those at Peking. The oversight of the city itself is under a
<i>fuyin</i> or mayor, superior to the prefect. The three provinces
are under as many marshals, whose subordinates rule the commanderies,
and these last have garrison officers subject to them,
whose rank and power correspond to the size and importance of
their districts. These delegate part of their power to “assistant
directors,” or residents, who are stationed in every town; on
the frontier posts, the officers have a higher grade, and report
directly to the marshals or their lieutenants. All the officers,
both civil and military, are Manchus, and a great portion of
them belong to the imperial clan, or are intimately connected
with it. By this arrangement, the Manchus are in a measure
disconnected with the general government of the provinces,
furnished with offices and titles, and induced to recommend
themselves for promotion in the Empire by their zeal and fidelity
in their distant posts.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mongolia</span> is the first in order of the colonies, by which are
meant those parts of the Empire under the control of the <i>Lí-fan
Yuen</i>, or Foreign Office.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> According to the statistics of the
Empire, it comprises the region lying between lats. 35° and 52°
N., and from long. 82° to 123° E.; bounded north by the
Russian governments of Trans-Baikalia, Irkutsk, Yeniseisk,
Tomsk, and Semipolatinsk; northeast and east by Manchuria;
south by the provinces of Chihlí and Shansí, and the Yellow
River; southwest by Kansuh; and west by Cobdo and Ílí.
These limits are not very strictly marked at all points, but the
length from east to west is about seventeen hundred miles,
and one thousand in its greatest breadth, inclosing an area of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
1,400,000 square miles, supporting an estimated population of
two millions. This elevated plain is almost destitute of wood
or water, inclosed southward by the mountains of Tibet, and
northward by offsets from the Altai range. The central part
is occupied by the desert of Gobi, a barren steppe having an
average height of 4,000 feet above the sea level, and destitute
of all running water. Owing to its elevation, extremely variable
climate, and the absence of oases, it may be considered quite
as terrible as Sahara, although the sand-waste here is, perhaps,
hardly as unmitigated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLIMATE AND DIVISIONS OF MONGOLIA.</div>

<p>The climate of Mongolia is excessively cold for the latitude,
arising partly from its elevation and dry atmosphere, and, on
the steppes, to the want of shelter from the winds. But this
has its compensation in an unclouded sky and the genial rays of
the sun, which support and cheer the people to exertion when
the thermometer is far below zero. The air has been drained of
its moisture by the ridges on every side; day after day the
sun’s heat reaches the earth with smaller loss than obtains in
moister regions in the same latitudes. Otherwise these wastes
would support no life at all at such an elevation. In the districts
bordering on Chihlí, the people make their houses partly
under ground, in order to avoid the inclemency of the season.
The soil in and upon the confines of this high land is unfit for
agricultural purposes, neither snow nor rain falling in sufficient
quantities, except on the acclivities of the mountain ranges;
but millet, barley, and wheat might be raised north and south
of it. The nomads rejoice in their freedom from tillage, however,
and move about with their herds and possessions within
the limits marked out by the Chinese for each tribe to occupy.</p>

<p>The space on the north of Gobi to the confines of Russia,
about one hundred and fifty miles wide, is warmer than the
desert, and supports a greater population than the southern
sides. Cattle are numerous on the hilly tracts, but none are
found in the desert, where wild animals and birds hold undisputed
possession. The thermometer in winter sinks to thirty
and forty degrees below zero (Fr.), and sudden and great
changes are frequent. No month in the year is free from snow
or frost; but on the steppes, the heat in summer is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
intolerable, owing to the radiation from the sandy or stony
surface. The snow does not fall very deep, and even in cold
weather the cattle find food under it; the flocks and herds are
not, however, large.</p>

<p>The principal divisions of Mongolia are four, viz.: 1, Inner
Mongolia, lying between the Wall and south of the desert; 2,
Outer Mongolia, between the desert and the Altai Mountains,
and reaching from the Inner Hing-an to the Tien shan; 3, the
country about Koko-nor, between Kansuh, Sz’chuen, and Tibet;
and, 4, the dependencies of Uliasutai, lying northwestward of
the Kalkas khanates. The whole of this region has been included
under the comprehensive name of Tartary, and if the
limits of Inner and Outer Mongolia had been the bounds of Tartary,
the appellation would have been somewhat appropriate.
But when Genghis arose to power, he called his own tribe
<i>Kukai Mongöl</i>, ‘Celestial People,’ and designated all the
other tribes <i>Tatars</i>, that is ‘tributaries.’<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The three tribes of
Kalkas, Tsakhars, and Sunnites, now constitute the great body
of Mongols under Chinese rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRIBES OF INNER MONGOLIA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Inner Mongolia</span>, or <i>Nui Mungku</i>, is bounded north by
Tsitsihar, the Tsetsen khanate, and Gobi, their frontiers being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
almost undefinable; east by Kirin and Shingking; south by
Chihlí and Shansí; and west by Kansuh. Wherever it runs
the Wall is popularly regarded as the boundary between China
and Mongolia. The country is divided into six <i>ming</i> or <i>chalkans</i>,
like our corps, and twenty-four <i>aimaks</i><a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> (tribes), which are
again placed under forty-nine standards or <i>khochoun</i>, each of
which generally includes about two thousand families, commanded
by hereditary princes, or dsassaks. The principal
tribes are the Kortchin and Ortous. The large tribe of the
Tsakhars, which occupies the region north of the Wall, is governed
by a <i>tutung</i>, or general, residing at Kalgan, and their
pasture grounds are now nominally included in the province of
Chihlí. The province of Shansí in like manner includes the
lands occupied by the Toumets, who are under the control of a
general stationed at Suiyuen, beyond the Yellow River. In the
pastures northwest from Kalgan, in the vicinity of Lakes
Chazau and Ichí, and reaching more than a hundred miles from
the Great Wall, lie the tracts appropriated to raising horses for
the “Yellow Banner Corps.” Excepting such grazing lands or
the vast hunting grounds near Jeh-ho, reserved in like manner
by the government, small settlements of Chinese are continually
squatting over the plains of Inner Mongolia, from whence they
have already succeeded in driving many of the aboriginal Mongol
tribes off to the north. Those natives who will not retire
are fain to save themselves from starvation or absorption by
cultivating the soil after the fashion of their neighbors, the
Chinese immigrants. It was, indeed, this influx of settlers
which led Kanghí to erect the southern portion of Inner Mongolia
into prefectures and districts like China Proper. This
alteration of habits among its population seems destined, ere
long, to modify the aspect of the country.</p>

<p>Most of the smaller tribes, except the Ortous, live between
the western frontiers of Manchuria, and the steppes reaching
north to the Sialkoi range, and south to Chahar. These tribes
are peculiarly favored by the Manchus, from their having joined
them in their conquest of China, and their leading men are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
often promoted to high stations in the government of the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUTER MONGOLIA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Outer Mongolia</span>, or <i>Wai Mungku</i>, is the wild tract lying
north of the last as far as Russia. It is bounded north by
Russia, east by Tsitsihar, southeast and south by Inner Mongolia,
southwest by Barkul in Kansuh, west by Tarbagatai,
and northwest by Cobdo and Uliasutai. The desert of Gobi
occupies the southern half of the region. It is divided into
four <i>lu</i>, or circuits, each of which is governed by a khan or
prince, claiming direct descent from Genghis, and superintending
the internal management of his own khanate. The Tsetsen
khanate lies west of Hurun-pir in Tsitsihar, extending from
Russia south to Inner Mongolia. West of it, reaching from
Siberia across the desert to Inner Mongolia, lies the Tuchétu
(or <i>Tusiétu</i> of Klaproth<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>) khanate, the most considerable of the
four; the road from Kiakhta to Kalgan lies within its borders.
West of the last, and bounded south by Gobi and northeast
by Uliasutai, lies the region of the Kalkas of Sainnoin; and on
its northwest lies the Dsassaktu khanate, south of Uliasutai,
and reaching to Barkul and Cobdo on the south and west. All
of them are politically under the control of two Manchu residents
stationed at Urga, who direct the mutual interests of the
Mongols, Chinese, and Russians.</p>

<p>Urga, or Kuren, the capital, is situated in the Tuchétu khanate,
in lat. 48° 20′ N., and long. 107&frac12;° E., on the Tola River, a
branch of the Selenga. It is the largest and most important
place in Mongolia, and is divided into <i>Maimai chin</i>, the Chinese
quarter, and <i>Bogdo-Kuren</i>, the Mongol settlement, nearly
three miles from the other. Its total population is estimated at
30,000, the Chinese inhabitants of which are forbidden by law
to live with their families; of the Mongols here, by far the larger
part is composed of lamas. In the estimation of these people
Urga stands next to H’lassa in degree of sanctity, being the seat
of the third person in the Tibetan patriarchate. According to
the Lama doctrine this dignitary&mdash;the <i>Kutuktu</i>&mdash;is the terrestrial
impersonation of the Godhead and never dies, but passes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
after his apparent decease, into the body of some newly born
boy, who is sought for afterwards according to the prophetic
indications of the Dalai-lama in Tibet. This holy potentate,
though of limited education and entirely under the control of
the attendant lamas, exercises an unbounded influence over the
Kalkas. It is, indeed, by means of him that the Chinese officials
control the native races of Mongolia. His wealth, owing to
contributions of enthusiastic devotees, is enormous; in and
about Urga he owns 150,000 slaves, an abundance of worldly
goods, and the most pretentious palace in Mongolia. Outside
of its religious buildings, Urga is disgustingly dirty; the filth
is thrown into the streets, and the habits of the people are
loathsome. Decrepid beggars and starving dogs infest the
ways; dead bodies, instead of being interred, are flung to birds
and beasts of prey; huts and hovels afford shelter for both rich
and poor.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The four khanates constitute one <i>aimak</i> or tribe, subdivided
into eighty-six standards, each of which is restricted to a certain
territory, within which it wanders about at pleasure. There
are altogether one hundred and thirty-five standards of the
Mongols. The Kalkas chiefly live between the Altai Mountains
and Gobi, but do not cultivate the soil to much effect.
They are devoted to Buddhism, and the lamas hold most of the
power in their hands through the <i>Kutuktu</i>. They render an
annual tribute to the Emperor of horses, camels, sheep, and
other animals or their skins, and receive presents in return of
many times its value, so that they are kept in subjection by
constant bribing; the least restiveness on their part is visited
by a reduction of presents and other penalties. An energetic
government, however, is not wanting in addition. The supreme
tribunal is at Urga; it is the <i>yamun</i>, par excellence, and has
both civil and military jurisdiction. The decisions are subject
to the revision of the two Chinese residents, and sentences
are usually carried into execution after their confirmation.
The punishments are horribly severe; but only a decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and cruel hand over these wild tribes can keep them from constant
strife.</p>

<p>Letters are encouraged among them by the Manchus, but
with little success. Many Buddhist books have been translated
into Mongolian by order of the Emperors; nor can we wonder
at the indifference to literature when this stuff is the aliment
provided them. Their tents, or <i>yurts</i>, are made of wooden
laths fastened together so as to form a coarse lattice-work; the
framework consists of several lengths secured with ropes, leaving
a door about three feet square. The average size is twelve
feet across and ten feet high; its shape is round and the conical
roof admits light where it emits smoke. The poles or rafters
are looped to the sides, and fastened to a hoop at the top.
Upon this framework sheets of heavy felt are secured according
to the season. A hearth in the centre holds the fire which
heats the kettle hanging over it, and warms the inmates squatted
round, who usually place only felt and sheepskins under
them. The felt protects from cold, rain, snow, and heat in a
wonderful manner. A first-class <i>yurt</i> is by no means an uncomfortable
dwelling, with its furniture, lining, shrine, and hot
kettle in the centre. A carpet for sleeping and sitting on is sometimes
seen in <i>yurts</i> of the wealthier classes; in these, too, the
walls are lined with cotton or silk, and the floors are of wood.
The lodges of the rich Kalkas have several apartments, and are
elegantly furnished, but destitute of cleanliness, comfort, or
airiness. Most of their cloths, utensils, and arms are procured
from the Chinese. The Sunnites are fewer than the Kalkas,
and roam the wide wastes of Gobi. Both derive some revenue
from conducting caravans across their country, but depend for
their livelihood chiefly upon the produce of their herds and
hunting. Their princes are obliged to reside in Urga, or keep
hostages there, in order that the residents may direct and restrain
their conduct; but their devotion to the <i>Kutuktu</i>, and
the easy life they lead, are the strongest inducements to remain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KIAKHTA AND THE TRADE WITH RUSSIA.</div>

<p>The trade with Russia formerly all passed through Kiakhta,
a town near the frontier, and was carried on by special agents
and officials appointed by each nation. The whole business
was managed in the interest of the government, and its rami<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>fications
furnished employment, position, and support to so
many persons as to form a bond of union and guaranty of peace
between them and their subjects. Timkowski’s journey with
the decennial mission to Peking in 1820-21 furnishes one of
the best accounts of this trade and intercourse now accessible,
and with Klaproth’s notes, given in the English translation
published in 1827, has long been the chief reliable authority
for the divisions and organization of the Mongol tribes. Since
the opening of the Suez Canal, through which Russian steamers
carry goods to and fro between Odessa and China, the largest
portion of the Chinese produce no longer goes to Kiakhta.
That which is required for Siberia is sent from Hankow by way
of Shansí, or from Kalgan and Tientsin, under the direction of
Russian merchants at those places. Furs, which once formed
the richest part of this produce, are gradually diminishing in
quality and quantity with the increase of settlers. In 1843 the
export of black tea for Russian consumption was only eight
millions of pounds, besides the brick tea taken by the Mongols.
Cottrell states the total value of the trade, annually, at that
period, at a hundred millions of rubles, reckoned then to be equal
to $20,830,000, on which the Russians paid, in 1836, about
$2,500,000 as import duty. The data respecting this trade of
forty years ago are not very accurate, probably; the monopoly
was upheld mostly for the benefit of the officials, as private
traders found it too much burdened.</p>

<p>Kiakhta is a hamlet of no importance apart from the trade.
The frontier here is marked by a row of granite columns; a stockade
separates it from Maimai chin. Pumpelly says: “One
can hardly imagine a sharper line than is here drawn. On the
one side of the stockade wall, the houses, churches, and people
are European, on the other, Chinese. With one step the traveller
passes really from Asia and Asiatic customs and language,
into a refined European society.” The goods pay duty at the
Russian <i>douane</i> in a suburb of fifty houses, near Kiakhta. The
Chinese town is also a small place, numbering between twelve
and fifteen hundred men (no women being allowed in the settlement)
who lived in idleness most of the year. This curious
hamlet has two principal streets crossing at right angles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
gates at the four ends, in the wooden wall which surrounds it.
These streets are badly paved, while their narrowness barely
allows the passage of two camels abreast. The one-storied houses
are constructed of wood, roofed with turf or boards, and consist
of two small rooms, one used as a shop and the other as a bedroom.
The windows in the rear apartment are made of oiled
paper or mica, but the door is the only opening in the shop.
The dwellings are kept clean, the furniture is of a superior description,
and considerable taste and show are seen in displaying
the goods. The traders live luxuriously, and attract a great crowd
there during the fair in February, when the goods are exchanged.
They are under the control of a Manchu, called the <i>dzarguchí</i>,
who is appointed for three years, and superintends the police of
the settlement as well as the commercial proceedings. There
are two Buddhist temples here served by lamas, and containing
five colossal images sitting cross-legged, and numerous smaller
idols.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The western portion of Mongolia, between the meridians of
84° and 96° E., extending from near the western extremity of
Kansuh province to the confines of Russia, comprising Uliasutai
and its dependencies, Cobdo, and the Kalkas and Tourgouths
of the Tangnu Mountains, is less known than any other
part of it. The residence of the superintending officer of this
province is at Uliasutai (<i>i.e.</i>, ‘Poplar Grove’), a town lying
northwest of the Selenga, in the khanate of Sainnoin, in a
well cultivated and pleasant valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROVINCE OF COBDO.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cobdo</span>, according to the Chinese maps, lies in the northwest of
Mongolia; it is bounded north and west by the government Yeniseisk,
northeast by Ulianghai, and southeast by the Dsassaktu
khanate, south by Kansuh, and west by Tarbagatai. The part
occupied by the Ulianghai or Uriyangkit tribes of the Tangnu
Mountains lies northeast of Cobdo, and north of the Sainnoin
and Dsassaktu khanates, and separated from Russia by the Altai.
These tribes are allied to the Samoyeds, and the rule over them is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
administered by twenty-five subordinate military officers, subject
to the resident at Uliasutai. This city is said to contain
about two thousand houses, is regularly built, and carries on
some trade with Urga; it lies on the Iro, a tributary of the
Jabkan. Cobdo comprises eleven tribes of Kalkas divided into
thirty-one standards, whose princes obey an amban at Cobdo
City, himself subordinate to the resident at Uliasutai. The
Chinese rule over these tribes is conducted on the same principles
as that over the other Mongols, and they all render fealty to
the Emperor through the chief resident at Uliasutai, but how
much obedience is really paid his orders is not known. The
Kalkas submitted to the Emperor in 1688 to avoid extinction in
their war with the Eleuths, by whom they had been defeated.</p>

<p>Cobdo contains several lakes, many of which receive rivers
without having any outlet. The largest is Upsa-nor, which receives
from the east the River Tes, and the Íkí-aral-nor into
which the Jabkan runs. The River Irtysh falls into Lake Dzaisang.
The existence of so many rivers indicates a more fertile
country north of the Altai or Ektag Mountains, but no bounties
of nature would avail to induce the inhabitants to adopt settled
modes of living and cultivate the soil, if such a clannish
state of society exists among them as is described by M. Lévchine
to be the case among their neighbors, the Kirghís.
The tribes in Cobdo resemble the American Indians in their
habits, disputes, and modes of life, more than the eastern
Kalkas, who approximate in their migratory character to the
Arabs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROVINCE AND LAKE OF KOKO-NOR.</div>

<p>The province of Tsing hai, or <span class="smcap">Koko-nor</span> (called Tsok-gum-bam
by the Tanguts), is not included in Mongolia by European
geographers, nor in the Chinese statistical works is it comprised
within its borders; the inhabitants are, however, mostly Mongols,
both Buddhist and Moslem, and the government is conducted on
the same plan as that over the Kalkas tribes further north.
This region is known in the histories of Central Asia under the
names of Tangout, Sifan, Turfan, etc. On Chinese maps it is
politically called Tsing hai (‘Azure Sea’), but in their books is
named <i>Sí Yu</i> or <i>Sí Yih</i>, ‘Western Limits.’ The borders are
now limited on the north by Kansuh, southeast by Sz’chuen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
south by Anterior Tibet, and west by the desert, comprising
about four degrees of latitude and eleven of longitude.</p>

<p>It includes within its limits several large lakes, which receive
rivers into their bosoms, and many of them having no outlets.
The Azure Sea is the largest, lying at an altitude of 10,500 feet
and overlooked by high mountains, which in winter are covered
with snow, and in summer form an emerald frame that
deepens the blueness of the water. It is over 200 miles in
circuit, and its evaporation is replaced by the inflowing waters
of eight large streams; one small islet contains a monastery,
whose inmates are freed from their solitude only when the ice
makes a bridge, as no boat is known to have floated on its salt
water. The wide, moist plains on the east and west furnish
pasturage for domestic and wild animals, and constant collisions
occur between the tribes resorting there for food. The travels
of Abbé Huc and Col. Prejevalsky furnish nearly all that is
known concerning the productions and inhabitants of Koko-nor.
The country is nominally divided into thirty-four banners, and
its Chinese rulers reside at Síning, east of the lake; but they
have more to do in defending themselves than in protecting
their subjects. The whole country is occupied by the Tanguts
of Tibetan origin, who are brigands by profession, and roam
over the mountains around the headwaters of the Yangtsz’ and
Yellow Rivers; by the Mohammedan Dunganis, who have latterly
been nearly destroyed in their recent rebellion; and by
tribes of Mongols under the various names of Eleuths, Kolos,
Kalkas, Surgouths, and Koits. The Chinese maps are filled
with names of various tribes, but their statistical accounts are as
meagre of information as the maps are deficient in accurate and
satisfactory delineations.</p>

<p>The topographical features of this region are still imperfectly
known, and its inhospitable climate is rendered more dangerous
by man’s barbarity. High mountain masses alternate with narrow
valleys and a few large depressions containing lakes; the
country lying south of the Azure Sea, as far as Burmah, is exceedingly
mountainous. West and southwest of the lake extends the
plain of Tsaidam, which at a recent geological age has been the
bed of a huge lake; it is now covered with morasses, shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
bogs, small rivers, and sheets of water&mdash;the most considerable
of the latter being Lake Kara, in the extreme western portion.
The saline argillaceous soil of this region is not adapted to vegetation.
Large animals are scarce, due in part to the plague of
insects which compels even the natives to retreat to the mountains
with their herds during certain seasons. Its inhabitants
are the same as those of Eastern Koko-nor; they are divided
into five banners, and number about 1,000 <i>yurts</i>, or 5,000 souls.</p>

<p>The Burkhan-buddha range forms the southern boundary of
this plain, and the northernmost limit of the lofty plateau of
Tibet. Its length from east to west is not far from 130 miles,
its eastern extremity being near the Yegrai-ula (the near sources
of the Yellow River) and Toso-nor. The range has no lofty
peaks, and stretches in an unbroken chain at a height of 15,000
to 16,000 feet; it is terribly barren, but does not attain the
line of perpetual snow. The southern range, which separates
the headwaters of the Yellow and Yangtsz’ Rivers, is called the
Bayan-kara Mountains; that northwest of this is called on
Chinese maps, Kílien shan and Nan shan, and bounds the desert
on the south. On the northern declivities of the Nan shan
range are several towns lying on or near the road leading across
Central Asia, which leaves the valley of the Yellow River at
Lanchau, in Kansuh, and runs N.N.W. over a rough country to
Liangchau, a town of some importance situated in a fertile and
populous district. From this place it goes northwest to Kanchau,
noted for its manufactures of felted cloths which are in
demand among the Mongol tribes of Koko-nor, and where large
quantities of rhubarb, horses, sheep, and other commodities are
procured. Going still northwest, the traveller reaches Suhchau,
the last large place before passing the Great Wall, which renders
it a mart for provisions and all articles brought from the
west in exchange for the manufactures of China. This city
was the last stronghold of the Dungani Moslems, and when
they were destroyed in 1873 it began to revive out of its ruins.
About fifty miles from this town is the pass of Kiayü, beyond
which the road to Hami, Urumtsi, and Ílí leads directly across
the desert, here about three hundred miles wide. This route
has been for ages the line of internal communication between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the west of China and the regions lying around and in the
basins of the Tarim River and the Caspian.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> A better idea of
the security of traffic and caravans within the Empire, and consequently
of the goodness of the Chinese rule, is obtained by
comparing the usually safe travel on this route with the hazards,
robberies, and poverty formerly met with on the great roads in
Bokhara, and the regions south and west of the Belur tag.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TANGUTS AND NOMADS OF KOKO-NOR.</div>

<p>The productions of Koko-nor consist of grain and other vegetables
raised along the bottoms of the rivers and margins of the
lakes; sheep, cattle, horses, camels, and other animals. Alpine
hares, wild asses,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> wild yaks, vultures, lammergeiers, pheasants,
antelopes, wolves, mountain sheep, and wild camels are among
the denizens of the wilds. The Chinese have settled among
the tribes, and Mohammedans of Turkish origin are found in
the large towns. There are eight corps between Koko-nor and
Uliasutai, comprising all the tribes and banners, and over which
are placed as many supreme generals or commanders appointed
from Peking. The leading tribes in Koko-nor are Eleuths,
Tanguts, and Tourbeths, the former of whom are the remnants
of one of the most powerful tribes in Central Asia. Tangout
submitted to the Emperor in 1690, and its population since the
incorporation has greatly increased. They inhabit the hilly region
of Kansuh, Koko-nor, Eastern Tsaidam, and the basin of
the Upper Yellow River. They resemble gipsies, being above
the average in height, with thick-set features, broad shoulders,
hair and whiskers, black, dark eyes, nose straight, lips thick
and protruding, face long and never flat, skin tawny. Unlike
the Mongols and Chinese they have a strong growth of beard
and whiskers which, however, they always shave. They wear
no tail, but shave their heads; their dress consists of furs and
cloths made into long coats that reach to the knees. Shirts or
trowsers are not made use of; their upper legs are generally
left bare. Women dress like the men. Their habitations are
wooden huts or black cloth tents. The Tangut is cunning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
stingy, lazy, and shiftless. His sole occupation that of tending
cattle (yaks). He is even more zealous a Buddhist than are the
Mongols, and extremely superstitious.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The trade at Síning is
large, but not equal to that between Yunnan and Burmah at
Talí and Bhamo; dates, rhubarb, chowries, precious stones, felts,
cloths, etc., are among the commodities seen in the bazaar. It
lies about a hundred miles from the sea, at an elevation of
7,800 feet, and near it is the famous lamasary of Kumbum,
where MM. Huc and Gabet lived in 1845. The town is well
situated upon the Síning ho, and though constructed for the
most part of wood, presents a fine appearance owing to the
number of official buildings therein. The population numbers
some 60,000 souls.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>The towns lying between the Great Wall and Ílí, though
politically belonging to Kansuh, are more connected with the
colonies in their form of government than with the Eighteen
Provinces. The first town beyond the Kiayü Pass is Yuhmun,
distant about ninety miles, and is the residence of officers, who
attend to the caravans going to and from the pass. It is represented
as lying near the junction of two streams, which flow
northerly into the Purunkí. The other district town of
Tunhwang lies across a mountainous country, upwards of two
hundred miles distant. The city of Ngansí chau has been
built to facilitate the communication across the desert to
Hami or Kamil, the first town in Songaria, and the dépôt of
troops, arms, and munitions of war. “With the town of
Hami,” says an Austrian visitor in these regions, “the traveller
comes upon the southern foot-hills of the Tien shan, and the
first traces of Siberian civilization. Magnificent mountain
scenery accompanies him on his way toward the west to the
Russian line. In the government of Semipolatinsk are the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>press
mail-wagons which stand ready at his order to carry him
at furious speed to the town of the same name, then to the
right bank of the River Irtysh, and so to Omsk.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> This route
and that stretching towards the southwest bring an important
trade to Hami; the country around it is cultivated by poor
Mongols.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Barkul, or Chinsí fu, in lat. 43° 40′ N., and long.
93° 30′ E., is the most important place in the department; the
district is called Ího hien. A thousand Manchus, and three
thousand Chinese, guard the post. The town is situated on the
south of Lake Barkul, and its vicinity receives some cultivation.
Hami and Turfan each form a <i>ting</i> district in the southeast
and west of the department. The trade at all these places consists
mostly of articles of food and clothing.</p>

<p>Urumtsi, or Tih-hwa chau (the <i>Bich-balik</i> of the Ouigours
in 1100<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>), in lat. 43° 45′ N., and long. 89° E., is the westernmost
department of Kansuh, divided into three districts, and containing
many posts and settlements. In the war with the Eleuths
in 1770, the inhabitants around this place were exterminated,
and the country afterwards repeopled by upwards of ten thousand
troops, with their families, and by exiles; emigrants from
Kansuh were also induced to settle there. The Chinese accounts
speak of a high mountain near the city, always covered
with ice and snow, whose base is wooded, and abounding with
pheasants; coal is also obtained in this region. The cold is
great, and snow falls as late as July. Many parts produce
grain and vegetables. All this department formerly constituted
a portion of Songaria. The policy of the Chinese government
is to induce the tribes to settle, by placing large bodies of troops
with their families at all important points, and sending their
exiled criminals to till the soil; the Mongols then find an increasing
demand for their cattle and other products, and are
induced to become stationary to meet it. So far as is known,
this policy had succeeded well in the regions beyond the Wall,
and those around Koko-nor; but the rebellion of the Dunganis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
who arose in these outlying regions at the moment when the
energies of the Peking government were all directed to suppressing
the Tai-ping insurrection, destroyed these improvements,
and frustrated, for an indefinite period, the promising
development of civilization among the inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIVISIONS AND BOUNDARIES OF ÍLÍ.</div>

<p>That part of the Empire called <span class="smcap">Ílí</span> is a vast region lying on
each side of the Tien shan, and including a tract nearly as large
as Mongolia, and not much more susceptible of cultivation. Its
limits may be stated as extending from lat. 36° to 49° N., and
from long. 71° to 96° E., and its entire area, although difficult
to estimate from its irregularity, can hardly be less than 900,000
square miles, of which Songaria occupies rather more than one-third.
It is divided into two <i>Lu</i>, or ‘Circuits,’ viz., the Tien
shan Peh Lu, and Tien shan Nan Lu, or the circuits north and
south of the Celestial Mountains. The former is commonly
designated Songaria, or Dzungaria, from the Songares or
Eleuths, who ruled it till a few scores of years past, and the latter
used to be known as Little Bokhara, or Eastern Turkestan.</p>

<p>Ílí is bounded north by the Altai range, separating it from
the Kirghís; northeast by the Irtysh River and Outer Mongolia;
east and southeast by Urumtsi and Barkul in Kansuh;
south by the desert and the Kwănlun range; and west by the
Belur-tag, dividing it from Badakshan and Russian territory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
In length, the Northern Circuit extends about nine hundred
miles, and the width, on an average, is three hundred miles.
The Southern Circuit reaches nearly twelve hundred and fifty
miles from west to east, and varies from three hundred to five
hundred in breadth, as it extends to the Kwănlun range on the
south. There is probably most arable land in the Northern
Circuit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOPOGRAPHY OF ÍLÍ.</div>

<p>Ílí, taken north of the Tarim basin, may be regarded as an
inland isthmus, extending southwest from the south of Siberia,
off between the Gobi and Caspian deserts, till it reaches the
Hindu Kush, leading down to the valley of the Indus. The
former of these deserts incloses it on the east and south, the
other on the west and northwest, separated from each other by
the Belur and Muz-tag ranges, which join with the Tien shan,
that divide the isthmus itself into two parts. These deserts
united are equal in extent to that of Sahara, but are not as arid
and tenantless.</p>

<p>This region has some peculiar features, among which its great
elevation, its isolation in respect to its water-courses, and the
character of its vegetation, are the most remarkable. Songaria
is especially noticeable for the many closed river-basins which
occur between the Altai and Tien shan, among the various
minor ranges of hills, each of which is entirely isolated, and
containing a lake, the receptacle of its drainage. The largest
of these singular basins is that of the River Ílí, which runs
about three hundred miles westward, from its rise in the Tien
shan (lat. 85°) till it falls into Lake Balkash, which also receives
some other streams; the superficies of the whole basin is
about forty thousand square miles. The other lakes lie north-eastward
of Balkash; the largest of them are the Dzaisang,
which receives the Irtysh, the Kisilbash, into which the Urungu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
flows, and four or five smaller ones between them, lying north
of the city of Ílí. Lake Temurtu, or Issik-kul, lies now just
beyond the southwestern part of this Circuit, and was until
recently contained therein. This sheet of water is deep and
never freezes; it is brackish, but full of fish; the dimensions
are about one hundred miles long, and thirty-five wide; its
superabundant waters flow off through the Chu ho into the
Kirghís steppe.</p>

<p>The Ala-tau range defines the lake on the north shore. Says
a Russian traveller in describing this region, “It would be difficult
to imagine anything more splendid than the view of the
Tien shan from this spot. The dark blue surface of the Issik-kul,
like sapphire, may well bear comparison with the equally
blue surface of Geneva Lake, but its expanse&mdash;five times as
great&mdash;seeming almost unlimited, and the matchless splendor of
its background, gives it a grandeur which the Swiss lake does
not possess. The unbroken, snowy chain here stretches away
for at least 200 miles of the length of the Issik-kul; the sharp
outlines of the spurs and dark valleys in the front range are
softened by a thin mist, which hangs over the water and
heightens the clear, sharp outlines of the white heads of the
Tien shan giants, as they rise and glisten on the azure canopy
of a central Asian sky. The line of perpetual snow commences
at three-fifths of their slope up, but as one looks, their snowless
base seems to sink the deeper in the far east, till the waves of
the lake seem to wash the snowy crests of Khan-Tengsè.” Forty
small rivers flow into it, but its size is gradually lessening.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Little is known concerning the topography, the productions,
or the civilization of the tribes who inhabit a large part of Songaria,
but the efforts of the Chinese government have been
systematically directed to developing its agricultural resources,
by stationing bodies of troops, who cultivate the soil, there, and
by banishing criminals thither, who are obliged to work for and
assist the troops. It gives one a higher idea of the rulers of
China, themselves wandering nomads originally, when they are
seen carrying on such a plan for extending the capabilities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
these remote parts of their Empire, and teaching, partly by force,
partly by bribes, and partly by example, the Mongol tribes under
them the advantages of a settled life.</p>

<p>The productions of Songaria are numerous. Wheat, barley,
rice and millet, are the chief corn stuffs; tobacco, cotton, melons,
and some fruits, are grown; herds of horses, camels, cattle, and
sheep, afford means of locomotion and food to the people, while
the mountains and lakes supply game and fish. The inhabitants
are composed mostly of Eleuths, with a tribe of Tourgouths,
and remnants of the Songares, together with Mongols, Manchus,
and Chinese troops, settlers and criminals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TIEN-SHAN PEH LU AND THE TOWN OF KULDJA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tien-shan Peh Lu</span> is divided by the Chinese into three commanderies,
<i>Ílí</i> on the west, <i>Tarbagatai</i> on the north, and <i>Kur-kara
usu</i> on the east, between Ílí and the west end of Kansuh.
The government of the North and South Circuits is under the
control of Manchu military officers residing at Ílí. This city,
called by the Chinese Hwuiyuen ching, and Gouldja (or Kuldja)
and Kuren by the natives, lies on the north bank of the Ílí
River, in lat. 43° 55′ N., and long. 81&frac12;° E.; it contains about
fifty thousand inhabitants, and carries on considerable trade
with China through the towns in Kansuh. The city was defended
by six strong fortresses in its neighborhood, and the
solidity of the stone walls enabled it to resist a vigorous assault
in the Dungani rebellion. Its circuit is nearly four miles, and
two wide avenues cross its centre, dividing it into four equal parts,
through each of which run many lanes. Its houses indicate the
Turkish origin of its builders in their clay or adobe walls and
flat roofs, and this impression is increased by the Jumma
mosque of the Taranchis, and the Dungan mosque, outside of
the walls. The last has a wonderful minaret built of small-roofed
pavilions one over another; both of them affect the
Chinese architecture in their roofs, and their walls are faced
with diamond-shaped tiles. The Buddhist temple has hardly
been rebuilt since the city has returned to Chinese rule. The
supply of meats and vegetables is constant, and the variety and
quality exceed that of most other towns in the region. The
population is gradually increasing with the return of peace and
trade, but is still under twenty thousand, of which not one-fifth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
are Chinese and Manchus: the Taranchis constitute half of the
whole, and Dunganis are the next in number. The province is
the richest and best cultivated of all this region of Ílí; its coal,
metals, and fruits are sources of prosperity, and with its return
to Chinese sway under new relations in respect to Russian trade,
its future is promising.</p>

<p>The destruction of life was dreadful at the capture of Kuldja
and other towns, which were then left a heap of ruins.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
Schuyler estimates that not more than a hundred thousand
people remained in the province, out of a third of a million in
1860. It is stated in Chinese works that when Amursana, the
discontented chief of the Songares, applied, in 1775, to Kienlung
for assistance against his rival Tawats or Davatsi, and was
sent back with a Chinese army, in the engagements which ensued,
more than a million of people were destroyed, and the
whole country depopulated. At that time, Kuldja was built by
Kienlung, and soon became a place of note. Outside of the
town are the barracks for the troops, which consist of Eleuths
and Mohammedans, as well as Manchus and Chinese. Coal is
found in this region, and most of the inland rivers produce
abundance of fish, while wild animals and birds are numerous.
The resources of the country are, however, insufficient to meet
the expenses of the military establishment, and the presents
made to the begs, and the deficit is supplied from China.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Subordinate to the control of the commandant at Kuldja are
nine garrisoned places situated in the same valley, at each of
which are bodies of Chinese convicts. The two remaining districts
of Tarbagatai and Kur-kara usu are small compared
with Ílí; the first lies between Cobdo and the Kirghís steppe,
and is inhabited mostly by emigrants from the steppes of the
latter, who render merely a nominal subjection to the garrisons
placed over them, but are easily governed through their tribal
rulers. The Tourgouths, who emigrated from Russia in 1772,
into China, are located in this district and Cobdo, as well as in
the valleys of the Tekes and Kunges rivers. They have become
more or less assimilated with other tribes since they were placed
here. In the war with the Songares, many of the people fled
from the valley of Ílí to this region, and after that country was
settled, they submitted to the Emperor, and partly returned to
Ílí. The chief town, called Tuguchuk by the Kirghís, and
Suitsing ching by the Chinese, is situated not far from the
southern base of the Tarbagatai Mountains, and contains about
six hundred houses, half of which belong to the garrison. It
is one of the nine fortified towns under the control of the commandant
at Kuldja, and a place of some trade with the Kirghís.
There are two residents stationed here, with high powers to oversee
the trade across the frontier, but their duties are inferior
in importance to those of the officials at Urga. 2,500 Manchu
and Chinese troops remain at this post, and since the conquest
of the country in 1772 by Kienlung, its agricultural products
have gradually increased under the industry of the Chinese.
The tribes dwelling in this distant province are restricted within
certain limits, and their obedience secured by presents. The
climate of Tarbagatai is changeable, and the cold weather
comprises more than half the year. The basin of Lake
Ala-kul, or Alaktu-kul, occupies the southwest, and part of the
Irtysh and Lake Dzaisang the northeast, so that it is well
watered. The trade consists chiefly of domestic animals and
cloths.</p>

<p>The town of Kur-kara usu lies on the River Kur, northeast
from Kuldja and on the road between it and Urumtsi; it is
called Kingsui ching by the Chinese. The number of troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
stationed at all these posts is estimated at sixty thousand, and
the total population of Songaria under two millions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POSITION OF TIEN-SHAN NAN LU.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Tien-shan Nan Lu</span>, or Southern Circuit of Ílí, the territory
of ‘the eight Mohammedan cities,’ was named <i>Sin
Kiang</i> (‘New Frontier’) by Kienlung. It is less fertile than
the Northern Circuit, the greatest part of its area consisting of
rugged mountains or barren wastes, barely affording subsistence
for herds of cattle and goats. The principal boundaries are the
Kwănlun Mountains, and the desert, separating it from Tibet on
the south; Cashmere lies on the southwest, and Badakshan and
Kokand are separated from it on the west and northwest by
the Belur-tag, all of them defined and partitioned by the mountain
ranges over which the passes 12,000 to 16,000 feet high
furnish both defence and travel according to the season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RIVER TARIM AND LOB-NOR.</div>

<p>The greater part of this Circuit is occupied with the basin of
the Tarim or Ergu, which flows from the Belur range in four
principal branches<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> (called from the towns lying upon their
banks the Yarkand, Kashgar, Aksu, and Khoten Rivers), and
running eastward, receives several affluents from the north and
south, and falls into Lake Lob in long. 89° E., after a course,
including windings, of between 1,100 and 1,300 miles. Of the
river system from which this stream flows Baron Richthofen
says, “the region which gives birth to this river is on a scale of
grandeur such as no other river in the world can boast. It is
girt round by a wide semicircular collar of mountains of the
loftiest and grandest character, often rising in ridges of 18,000
to 20,000 feet in height, while the peaks shoot up to 25,000 and
even 28,000 feet. The basin which fills in the horse-shoe shaped
space encompassed by these gigantic elevations, though deeply
depressed below them, stands at a height above the sea varying
from 6,000 feet at the margin to about 2,000 in the middle,
and formed the bed of an ancient sea. From its wall-like sides
on the south, west, and north, the waters rush headlong down,
and though the winds blowing from all directions deposit most
of their moisture on the remoter sides of the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
ranges, viz., the southern foot of the Himalayas, the west side
of the Pamir, and the northern slope of the Tien shan, the
streams formed thereby winding through the cloud-capped lofty
cradle-land, and breaking through the mountain chains, reach
the old ocean bed only partly well watered. The smallest of
them disappear in the sand, others flow some distance before
expanding into a level salt basin and are there absorbed. Only
the largest, whose number the Chinese estimate at sixty, unite
with the Tarim, a river 1,150 miles long, and therefore in
length between the Rhine and Danube, but far surpassing both
in the massiveness of surrounding mountains, just as it exceeds
the Danube in the extent of its basin. Its tributaries form
along the foot of the mountains a number of fruitful oases, and
these by means of artificial irrigation have been converted into
flourishing, cultivated states, and have played an important part
in the history of these regions.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Col. Prejevalsky’s explorations
in this totally unknown country have brought out a multitude
of facts pregnant with interest both for historical and geographical
study. Among the most important results of his discoveries
is the location of Lob more than a degree to the south
of its position on Chinese maps, and a consequent bend of the
Tarim from its due eastern course before it reaches its outlet.
This lake, consisting of two sheets of water, the Kara-buran
and Kara-kurchin (or Chon-kul), lies on the edge of the desert,
in an uninhabited region, and surrounded by great swamps,
which extend also northwest along the Tarim to its junction
with the Kaidu. It is shallow, overgrown with weeds, and is
for the most part a morass, the water being fresh, despite the salt
marshes in the vicinity. The people living near it speak a language
most like that of Khoten; they are Moslems. Lake Lob is
elliptical, 90 to 100 versts long and 20 wide, 2,200 feet above the
sea. Enormous flocks of birds come from Khoten on the south-west,
as they go north, and make Lob-nor their stopping-place.
The desert in this region is poor and desolate in the extreme.
Its southern side is formed by the Altyn-tag range, a spur of
the Kwănlun Mountains that rises about 14,000 feet in a sheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
wall. Wild camels are found in its ravines, whose sight, hearing,
and smell are marvellously acute. No other river basins of
any size are found within the Circuit, except a large tributary
called the Kaidu, which, draining a parallel valley north of Lob-nor,
two hundred miles long, runs into a lake nearly as large,
called Bostang-nor, from which an outlet on the south continues
it into the Tarim, about eighty miles from its mouth.
The tributaries of this river are represented as much more serviceable
for agricultural purposes than the main trunk is for
navigation. The plain through which the Tarim flows is about
two hundred miles broad and not far from nine hundred miles
long, most of it unfit for cultivation or pasturage. The desert
extends considerably west of the two lakes. The climate of
this region is exceedingly dry, and its barrenness is owing,
apparently, more to the want of moisture than to the nature of
the soil. The western parts are colder than those toward
Kansuh, the river being passable on ice at Yarkand, in lat. 38°,
for three months, while frost is hardly known at Hami, in lat.
43°.</p>

<p>The productions of the valley of the Tarim comprise most
of the grains and fruits found in Southern Europe; the sesamum
is cultivated for oil instead of the olive. Few trees or
shrubs cover the mountain acclivities or plains. All the domestic
animals abound, except the hog, which is reared in small numbers
by the Chinese. The camel and yak are hunted and raised
for food and service, their coats affording both skins and hair
for garments. The horse, camel, black cattle, ass, and sheep, are
found wild on the edge of the desert, where they find a precarious
subsistence. The mountains and marshes contain jackals,
tigers, bears, wolves, lynxes, and deer, together with some large
species of birds of prey. Gold, copper, and iron are brought
from this region, but the amount is not large, and as articles of
trade they are less important than the sal-ammoniac, saltpetre,
sulphur, and asbestos obtained from the volcanic region in the
east of the Celestial Mountains. The best specimens of the
<i>yuh</i> or nephrite, so highly prized by the Chinese, are obtained
in the Southern Circuit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOWNS OF THE SOUTHERN CIRCUIT.</div>

<p>The present divisions of this Circuit are regulated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
position of the eight Mohammedan cities. The western departments
of Kansuh naturally belong to the same region, and the
cities now pertaining to that province are inhabited by entirely
similar races, and governed in the same feudal manner, with
some advantages in consideration of their early submission to
Kienlung. The first town on the road, of note, is Hami; Turfan
and Pidshan are less important as trading posts than as
garrisons. The eight cities are named in the <cite>Statistics of the
Empire</cite> in the following order, beginning at the east: Harashar,
Kuché, Ushí (including Sairim and Bai), Aksu, Khoten,
Yarkand, Kashgar, and Yingkeshar or Yangi Hissar. The
superior officers live at Yarkand, but the Southern Circuit is
divided into four minor governments at Harashar, Ushí, Yarkand,
and Khoten, each of whose residents reports both to Kuldja
and Peking. There is constant restiveness on the part of the
subject races, who are all Moslems, arising from their clannish
habits and feuds; they have not the elements of substantial
progress and national growth, either under their own rulers or
Chinese. They have lately thrown off the Peking Government,
but they have generally regretted the rapines and waste caused
by the strifes and change, and would probably receive the
<i>Kitai</i> (so they term the Chinese) back again. The latter are
not hard masters, and bring trade and wealth the longer they
remain. One of the Usbek chiefs under Yakub khan gave
the pith of the situation between the two, when he replied to
Dr. Bellew’s remark that he talked like a Chinese himself,
“No, I hate them. But they were not bad rulers. We had
everything then; we have nothing now. We never see any
signs of the Kitai trade, nor of the wealth they brought here.”</p>

<p>Harashar (or Karashar) lies on the Kaidu River, not far from
Lake Bagarash or Bostang, about two hundred and ninety miles
west of Turfan, in lat. 42° 15′ N., and long. 87° E. It is a
large district, and has two towns of some note within the jurisdiction
of its officers&mdash;namely, Korla and Bukur. Harashar is
fortified, and from its being a secure position, and the seat of
the chief resident, attracts considerable trade. The embroidery
is superior; but the tribes living in the district are more addicted
to hunting than disposed to sedentary trades. Korla lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
southwest of Harashar on the Kaidu, between lakes Bostang
and Lob, and the productions of the town and its vicinity indicate
a fertile soil; the Chinese say the Mohammedans who live
here are fond of singing, but have no ideas of ceremony or
urbanity. Bukur lies two hundred miles west of Korla and
“might be a rich and delicious country,” says the Chinese account,
“but those idle, vagrant Mohammedans only use their
strength in theft and plunder; the women blush at nothing.”
The town formerly contained upward of ten thousand inhabitants,
but Kienlung nearly destroyed it; the district has been
since resettled by Hoshoits, Tourbeths, and Turks, and the people
carry on some trade in the produce of their herds, skins, copper,
and agates.</p>

<p>Kuché, about eighty miles west from Bukur, lat. 41° 37′ N.,
and long. 83° 20′ E., is a larger and more important city than that
of Harashar, for the road which crosses the Tien shan by the
pass Muz-daban to Ílí, here joins that coming from Aksu on
the west and Hami on the east. It is three miles in circuit, and
is defended by ten forts and three hundred troops. The
bazaars contain grain, fruits, and vegetables, raised in the vicinity
by great labor, for the land requires to be irrigated by hand
from wells, pools, and streams. Copper, sulphur, and saltpetre
are carried across to Ílí, for use of government as well as traffic,
being partly levied from the inhabitants as taxes; linen is
manufactured in the town, and sal ammoniac, cinnabar, and
quicksilver are procured from the mountains. Kuché is considered
the gate of Turkestan, and is the chief town, politically
speaking, between Hami and Yarkand. The district and town
of Shayar lie south of Kuché, in a marshy valley producing
abundance of rice, melons, and fruit; the pears are particularly
good. Two small lakes, Baba-kul and Sary-kamysch, lie to the
east of this town, and are the only bodies of water between
Bostang-nor and Issik-kul. The population is about four thousand,
ruled by <i>begs</i> subordinate to the general at Kuché.</p>

<p>The valley of the Aksu contains two large towns, Aksu and
Ushí or Ush-turfan, besides several posts and villages. Between
the former and Kuché, lie the small garrisons and districts of
Bai and Sairim. The first contains from four to five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
families, ruled by their own chiefs. Sairim or Hanlemuh is
subordinate to Ushí in some degree, but its productions, climate,
and inhabitants are like those of Kuché. “Their manners are
simple,” remarks a Chinese writer, speaking of the people;
“they are neither cowards nor rogues like the other Mohammedans;
they are fond of singing, drinking, and dancing, like
those of Kuché.” Aksu is a large commercial and manufacturing
town, containing twenty thousand inhabitants, situated,
like Kuché, at the termination of a road leading across the Tien
shan to Ílí, and attracting to its market traders from Siberia,
Bokhara, and Kokand, as well as along the great road. Its manufactures
of cotton, silk, leather, harnesses, crockery, precious
stones, and metals are good, and sent abroad in great numbers.
The country produces grain, fruits, vegetables, and cattle in perfection,
and the people are more civilized than those on the east
and north; “they are generous and noble, and both sing and
ridicule the oddities and niggardliness of the other Mohammedans.”
The Chinese garrison consists of three thousand soldiers,
and the officers are accountable to those at Ushí.</p>

<p>Ushí lies about 70 miles due west of Aksu, in lat. 41° 15′ N.
and long. 79° 40′ E., and is stated to contain ten thousand inhabitants.
The Chinese name is Yung-ning ching (<i>i.e.</i> ‘City of
Eternal Tranquillity’). The officers stationed here report to the
commandant at Ílí, but they communicate directly with Peking,
and receive the Emperor’s sanction to their choice of begs, and
to the envoys forwarded to the capital with tribute. Copper
money is cast here in ingots, somewhat like the ingots of sycee
in the provinces. There are six forts attached to Ushí, to keep
in order the wandering tribes of the Kirghís, called Pruth Kirghís,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
which roam over the frontier regions between Ushí and
Yarkand. They pay homage to the officers at Ushí, but give
no tribute. Those who do pay tribute are taxed a tenth, but
the Kirghís on this frontier are usually allowed to roam where
they like, provided they keep the peace. This region was
nearly depopulated by Kienlung’s generals, and at present sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>ports
a sparse population compared with its fertility and resources.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOVERNMENT AND TOWN OF KASHGAR.</div>

<p>The government of Kashgar, known, at the time of the Arab
conquest, as <i>Kichik Bukhara</i>, presents a vast, undulating plain,
of which the slope is very gradual toward the east, and of which
the general elevation may be reckoned at from three to four
thousand feet above the sea. The aspect of its surface is mostly
one of unmitigated waste&mdash;a vast spread of bare sand and
gloomy salts, traversed in all directions by dunes and banks of
gravel, with the scantiest vegetation, and all but absence of
animal life. Such is the view that meets the eye and joins the
horizon everywhere on the plain immediately beyond the river
courses and the settlements planted on their banks.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The population
of this whole district is considerably less than a million
and a half. The natural mineral productions here are of great
value, and it is a knowledge of this fact which has induced the
Chinese to persevere in retaining so expensive and turbulent a
frontier province. The gold and jade of Khoten, silver and
lead of Cosharab, and copper of Khalistan, have given abundant
employment to Chinese settlers; while coal, iron, sulphur,
alum, sal ammoniac, and zinc, though worked in unimportant
quantities before the insurrection of Yakub khan (Atalik
Ghazi), furnished the inhabitants with supplies for domestic
use. An important hinderance to building villages in many sections
of this territory is the prevalence of sand dunes here.
Solitary houses and even whole settlements lying in the path of
these moving hills are suddenly overwhelmed and oftentimes
totally effaced.</p>

<p>The town of Kashgar is situated at the northwestern angle
of the Southern Circuit, on the Kashgar River, a branch of the
Tarim, in lat. 39° 25′ N., and long. 76° 5′ E., at the extreme
west of the Empire. Several roads meet here. Going in a
northwest direction, one leads over the Tien shan to Kokand; a
second passes south, through Yarkand and Khoten, to Leh and
Cashmere; a third, the great caravan route, from China through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Ushí, may be said to end here; and the fourth and most frequented,
leads off northwest over the Tien shan through the
Rowat Pass, and along the western banks of Lake Issik-kul to
Ílí. Kashgar was the capital of the Ouigours for a long time, and
its ruler forced his people, as far east as Hami, to accept Islamism
about the year 1000. They then came under Genghis’
sway, and this city increased its importance, but when Abubahr
Miza took Yarkand, he razed Kashgar to the ground. Under
Chinese rule it became one of the richest marts in Central
Asia, and its future importance is secured by its position. The
city is enclosed with high and massive walls, supported by buttress
bastions, and protected by a deep ditch on three sides, the
river flowing under the fourth. There are but two gates; the
area within is about fifty acres. Around it are populous
suburbs.</p>

<p>In the middle of the town is a large square, and four bazaars
branch from it through to the gates; the garrison is placed
without the walls. The manufactures of Kashgar excel those
of any other town in the two Circuits, especially in jade, gold,
silk, cotton, gold and silver cloths, and carpets. The country
around produces fruit and grain in abundance; “the manners
of the people have an appearance of elegance and politeness,”
says the Chinese geographer; “the women dance
and sing in family parties; they fear and respect the officers,
and have not the wild, uncultivated aspect of those in
Ushí.” This judgment is in a measure confirmed by Bellew,
who credits the people with being singularly free from prejudice
against the foreigners, quite indifferent on any score of his
nationality or religion, and content so long as he pays his way
and does not offend the customs of the natives. Several towns
are subordinate to Kashgar, because of its oversight of their
rulers, and consumption of their products. Southwest lies Tash-balig,
and on the road leading to Yarkand is Yangi Hissar, both
of them towns of some importance; the whole distance from
Kashgar presents a succession of sandy or saline tracts, alternating
with fertile bottoms wherever water runs. Small villages
and post houses serve to connect the larger towns, but the soil
does not reward the cultivators with much produce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CITY OF YARKAND.</div>

<p>Yarkand, or Yerkiang, is the political capital of the Southern
Circuit, as the highest military officers and strongest force
are stationed here. It is situated on the Yarkand River, in lat.
36° 30′ N., and long. 77° 15′ E., in the midst of a sand-girt
oasis of great fertility. The environs are abundantly supplied
with water by canals. The stone walls are three miles in circumference,
but its suburbs are much larger; the houses are
built of dried bricks, and the town has a more substantial appearance
than others in Ílí. There are many mosques and colleges,
which, with the public buildings occupied by the government
and troops, add to its consideration. Yarkand is one of
the ancient cities of Tartary, and was, in remote times, a royal
residence of Turk princes of the Afrasyab dynasty. In modern
times it owes its rank as a well-built city chiefly to Abubahr
Miza, whose short-lived sway from Aksu to Wakhan left its
chief results in the mosques and bazaars erected or enlarged by
him. By means of quarrying jade in the Karakash valley, and
working the bangles, ear-rings and other articles in the city,
thousands of families found employment under Chinese rule.</p>

<p>With the overthrow of that sway and then of Yakub khan in
its restoration, all this industry disappeared. In the destruction
ensuing on these long struggles for supremacy, one learns the
explanation of the barbarism which has succeeded the downfall
of mighty empires all over Western Asia. The city has no important
manufactures; it enjoys a local reputation for its
leather, and boots and shoes made here are esteemed all over
the province. Among other articles of trade are horses, silk,
and wool, and fabrics made from them; but everything found
at Kashgar is sold also at this market. In a Chinese notice of
the city, the customs at Yarkand are stated to have yielded over
$45,000 annually; the taxes are 35,400 sacks of grain, 57,569
pieces of linen, 15,000 lbs. of copper, besides gold, silk, varnish,
and hemp, part of which are carried to Ílí. Jade is obtained
from the river in large pieces, yellow, white, black, and reddish,
and the articles made from it are carried to China. The Chinese
authorities have no objection to the resorting thither of
natives of Kokand, Badakshan, and other neighboring states,
many of whom settle and marry.</p>

<p>Khoten is situated on the southern side of the desert, and the
district embraces all the country south of Aksu and Yarkand,
along the northern base of the Kwănlun Mountains, for more
than three hundred miles from east to west. The capital is
called Ílchí on Chinese maps, and lies in an extensive plain on
the Khoten River in lat. 37° N., and long. 80° E. The town
of Karakash (meaning ‘Black Jade’)<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> lies in lat. 37° 10′, long.
80° 13′ 30″, a few miles northwest in the same valley, and is
said by traders to be the capital rather than Ílchí; it is located
on the road to Yarkand, distant twelve days’ journey. On
this road the town of Gummí is also placed, whose chief had in
his possession a stone supposed to have the power of causing
rain. Kirrea lies five days’ journey east of Ílchí, near the pass
across the mountains into Tibet and Ladak; a gold mine is
worked near this place, the produce of which is monopolized by
the Chinese. The three towns of Karakash, Ílchí, and Kirrea,
are the only places of importance between the valley of the
Tarim and Tibet, but none of them have been visited for a long
time by Europeans.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The population of the town or district is
unknown; one notice<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> gives it a very large number, approaching
three millions and even more, which at any rate indicates
a more fertile soil and genial climate than the regions north and
south of it. Dr. Morrison, in his <cite>View of China</cite>, puts it at
44,630 inhabitants; and although the former includes the whole
district, and is probably too large, the second seems to be much
too small.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KHOTEN DISTRICT.</div>

<p>Khoten is known, in Chinese books, by the names of <i>Yu-tien</i>,
<i>Hwan-na</i>, <i>Kieu-tan</i>, and <i>Kiu-sa-tan-na</i>&mdash;the last meaning, in
Sanscrit, “Breast of the Earth.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Its eastern part is marshy,
but that the country must have a considerable elevation is
manifest from the fact that the river which drains and connects
it with the Tarim runs quite across the desert in its
course. The country is governed by two high officers and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
detachment of troops; there are six towns under their jurisdiction,
the inhabitants of which are ruled in the same manner as
the other Mohammedan cities. The people, however, are said
to be mostly of the Buddhist faith, and the Chinese give a good
account of their peacefulness and industry. The trade with
Leh and H’lassa is carried on by a road crossing the Kwănlun
over the Kirrea Pass, beyond which it divides. The productions
of Khoten are fine linen and cotton stuffs, jade ornaments,
amber, copper, grain, fruits, and vegetables; the former for exportation,
the latter for use. It was in this region that Col.
Prejevalsky discovered (in 1879) a new variety of wild horse, a
specimen of which has been stuffed and exhibited in St. Petersburg.
The animal in question, though belonging undoubtedly
to the genus <i>Equus</i>, presents, in many respects, an intermediate
form between the domestic horse and the wild ass.</p>

<p>Rémusat published, in 1820, an account of this country,
drawn from Chinese books, in which the principal events in its
history are stated, commencing with the Han dynasty, before
the Christian era, down to the Manchu conquest. In the early
part of its history, Khoten was the resort of many priests from
India, and the Buddhist faith was early established there. It
was an independent kingdom most of the time, from its earliest
mention to the era of Genghis khan, the princes sometimes extending
their sway from the Kiayü pass and Koko-nor to the
Tsung ling, and then being obliged to contract to the valley now
designated as Khoten. After the expulsion of the Mongols
from China, Khoten asserted its independence, but afterward
fell under the sway of the Songares and Eleuths, and lost many
of its inhabitants. The Manchus conquered it in 1770, when
the rest of the region between the Tien shan and Kwănlun fell
under their sway, but neither have they settled in it to the same
extent, nor made thereof a penal settlement, as in other parts
of Ílí.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>



<div class="sidenote">GOVERNMENT OF ÍLÍ.</div>

<p>The government of Ílí differs in some respects from that of
Mongolia, where religion is partly called in to aid the state. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the Northern Circuit, the authority is strictly military, exercised
by means of residents and generals, with bodies of troops under
their control. The supreme command of all Ílí is intrusted by
the colonial office to a Manchu <i>tsiangkiun</i>, or military governor-general
at Kuldja, who has under him two councillors to take
cognizance of civil cases, and thirty-four residents scattered
about in both Circuits. This governor has also the control of
the troops stationed in the three western departments of Kansuh,
but has nothing to do with the civil jurisdiction of those
towns. The entire number of soldiers under his hand is stated
at 60,000, most of whom have families, and add agricultural,
mechanical, or other labors to the profession of arms. The
councillors are not altogether subordinate to the general, but report
to the Colonial Office.</p>

<p>In the Northern Circuit, there is a deputy appointed for
every village and town, invested with military powers over the
troops and convicts, and civil supervision over the native <i>píko</i>
or chieftains, who are the real rulers acknowledged by the clans.
The character of the inhabitants north of the Tien shan is rendered
unlike that of those dwelling in the Southern Circuit, not
more by the diversity in their language and nomadic habits,
than by the sway religious rites and allegiance have over them.
Through this latter motive, the government of Mongolia and
the Northern Circuit is rendered far easier and more effectual
for the distant court of Peking than it otherwise would be.
The appointment of the native chieftains is first announced to
the general at Kuldja and the Colonial Office, and they succeed
to their post when confirmed, which, as the station is in a measure
hereditary, usually follows in course.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Southern Circuit are Mohammedans
and acknowledge a less willing subjection to the Emperor than
those in the Northern, the differences in race, religion, and language
being probably the leading reasons. The government
of the whole region is divided among the Manchu residents or
<i>ambans</i> at the eight cities, who are nominally responsible to the
general at Ílí, and independent of each other, but there is a
gradation in rank and power, the one at Yarkand having the
priority. The begs are chosen by the tribes themselves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
exercise authority in all petty cases arising among the people,
without the interference of the Chinese. The troops are all
Manchu or Chinese, none of the Turks being enrolled in separate
bodies, though individuals are employed with safety.
There is considerable difference in the rank and influence of
the begs, which is upheld and respected by the <i>ambans</i>. The
allowances and style granted them are regulated in a measure
by their feudal importance. The revenue is derived from a
monthly capitation tax on each man of about half a dollar, and
tithes on the produce; there are no transit duties as in China,
but custom-houses are established at the frontier trading towns.
The language generally used in the Southern Circuit is the
Jaghatai Turki of the Kalmucks; the Usbecks constitute the majority
of the people, but Eleuths and Kalmucks are everywhere
intermixed. The Tibetans have settled in Khoten, or more
probably, remnants still exist there of the former inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HISTORY AND CONQUEST OF ÍLÍ.</div>

<p>The history of the vast region constituting the present government
of Ílí early attracted the attention of oriental scholars,
and few portions of the world have had a more exciting history.
After the expulsion of the Mongols from China by
Hungwu, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1366, they found that they, as a tribe, were inferior
in power to the western tribes, but it was not till about
1680 that the Eleuths, north of the Tien shan under the Galdan,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
began to attack the Kalkas, and drive them eastward.
The Sunnites, Tsakhars, and Solons, portions of the Eastern
Mongols, had already joined the Manchus; and the Kalkas, to
avoid extermination, submitted to them also, and besought their
assistance against the Eleuths. Kanghí received their allegiance,
and tried to settle the difficulties peaceably, but was
obliged to send his troops against the Galdan, and drive him
from the territory of the Kalkas to the westward of Lob-nor
and Barkul. The Emperor was materially aided in this enterprise
by the secession from the Eleuths of the Songares,
whose khan had taken offence, and drawn his hordes off to the
south. The khans of the Kalkas and their vast territory thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
became subject to the Chinese. The Galdan lost all his forces,
and expired by poison, in 1697, his power dying with him, and
his tribe having already become too weak to resist.</p>

<p>Upon the ruins of his power arose that of Arabdan, the khan
of the Songares. He subjugated the Northern Circuit, passed
over into Turkestan, Tangout, and Khoten, and gradually reduced
to his sway nearly all the elevated region of Central Asia
west of Kansuh. He expelled the Tourgouths from their possessions
in Cobdo, and compelled them to retreat to the banks
of the Volga. Kanghí expelled the Songares from the districts
about Koko-nor, but made no impression upon their authority
in Songaria. After the death of Arabdan, about 1720, his
throne was disputed, and the power weakened by dissensions
among his sons, so that it was seized by two usurpers, Amursana
and Tawats, who also fell out after their object was gained.
Amursana repaired to Peking for assistance, and with the aid
of a Chinese army expelled Tawats, and took possession of the
throne of Arabdan. But he had no intention of becoming a
vassal to Kienlung, and was no sooner reinstated than he resisted
him; he defeated two Chinese armies sent against him,
but succumbed on the third attack, and fled to Tobolsk, where
he died in 1757.</p>

<p>The territory of Arabdan then fell to Kienlung, and he pursued
his successes with such cruelty that the Northern Circuit
was nearly depopulated, and the Songares and Eleuths became
almost extinct as distinct tribes. The banished tribe of Tourgouths
was then invited by the Emperor to return from Russian
sway to their ancient possessions, which they accepted in
1772; the history of the Chinese embassy to them, and their
disastrous journey back to Cobdo over the Kirghís steppe and
through the midst of their enemies, is one of the most remarkable
instances of nomadic wanderings and unexampled suffering
in modern times.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Chinese troops, emigrants, exiles, and
nomadic tribes and families, were sent and encouraged to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
into the vacant territory, so that erelong it began to resume its
former importance. In the period which has since elapsed, the
Manchus have been enabled to prevent any combination among
the clans, and maintain their own authority by a mixed system
of coercion and coaxing which they well know how to practise.
The agricultural and mineral resources of the country have
been developed, many of the nomads induced to attend to agriculture
by making their chieftains emulous of each other’s prosperity,
and by exciting a spirit of traffic among all.</p>

<p>There have been some disturbances from time to time, but no
master spirit has arisen who has been able to unite the tribes
against the Chinese. In 1825, there was an attempt made
from Kokand by Jehangír, grandson of the <i>kojeh</i> or prince of
Kashgar, to regain possession of Turkestan; the khan of Kokand
assisted him with a small army, and such was their dislike
of the Chinese, that as soon as Jehangír appeared, the Mohammedans
arose and drove the Chinese troops away or put them
to death, opening the gates to the invader. He took possession
of Yarkand and Kashgar, and advanced to Aksu, where the
winter put a stop to the campaign. In the next year, the khan
of Kokand, seeing the disposition of the people, thought he
would embark himself in the same cause, and made an incursion
as far as Aksu and Khoten, reducing more than half the
Southern Circuit to himself, but ostensibly in aid of Jehangír.
The kojeh, beginning to fear his aid, withdrew; and the khan,
having suffered some reverses from the Chinese troops, made his
peace on very favorable terms, and returned to his own country.
Jehangír went to Khoten from Yarkand, but his conduct there
displeasing the people, the Chinese troops, about 60,000 in
number, had no difficulty in dispersing his force, and resuming
their sway. The adherents of the kojeh fled toward Badakshan,
while he himself repaired to Isaac, the newly appointed kojeh
of Kashgar, by whom he was delivered up to the Chinese with
his family, and all of them most barbarously destroyed.</p>

<p>The kojeh was rewarded with the office of prince of Kashgar,
but having been accused of treasonable designs he was ordered
to come to Peking for trial; the charges were all disproved,
and he returned to Kashgar after several years’ residence at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the capital of the Empire. The country was gradually reduced
by Changling, the general at Ílí, but Kashgar suffered so much
by the war and removal of the chief authority to Yarkand,
that it has not since regained its importance. During this war,
the dislike of the Mohammedans to the Chinese sway was exhibited
in the large forces Jehangír brought into the field; and
if he had been a popular spirited leader, there is reason for
supposing he might have finally wrested these cities from the
Chinese. The joy of Taukwang at the successful termination
of the expedition and capture of the rebel, was so extravagant
as to appear childish; and when Jehangír was executed at
Peking, he ordered the sons of two officers who had been reported
killed, “to witness his execution, in order to give expansion
to the indignation which had accumulated in their
breasts; and let the rebel’s heart be torn out and given to them
to sacrifice it at the tombs of their fathers, and thus console
their faithful spirits.” Honors were heaped upon Changling at
his return to Peking, and rewards and titles showered upon all
the troops engaged in the war.</p>

<p>Since this insurrection, the frontiers of Kashgar and Kokand
have been passed and repassed by the Pruth Kirghís; in 1830,
they excited so much trouble because their trade was restricted,
that a large force was called out to restrain them, and many
lives were lost before the rising was subdued. The causes of
the dispute were then examined, and the trade allowed to go on
as before. The oppressions of the residents sometimes goad
on the Mohammedans to rise against the Chinese, but the
policy of the Emperor is conciliatory, and the complaints of the
people are in general listened to. The visits of the begs and
princes to Peking with tribute affords them an opportunity to
state their grievances, while it also prevents them from caballing
among themselves. In 1871 the Russians took possession of
nearly the whole of Tien-Shan Peh Lu during an insurrection of
the Dunganis against Chinese control. The Tarantchis having
attacked a Russian outpost, and Yakub Beg being on suspiciously
good terms with the rebels, it was determined to occupy
Kuldja&mdash;which was effected after a campaign of less than a
month, led by Gen. Kolpakofsky. The Chinese government was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
immediately informed that the place should be restored whenever
a sufficient force could be brought there to hold it against
attacks, and preserve order. After the final conquest of the
Dungan tribes in 1879-80, this territory was returned by the
Russians upon conclusion of their last treaty with China, exactly
ten years from the date of possession. The old manner
of government is now resumed and the country slowly recovering
from the frightful devastation of the insurrection. The
salaries of the governor-general and his councillors, and the
residents, are small, and they are all obliged to resort to illegal
means to reimburse their outlays. The highest officer receives
about $5,200 annually, and his councillors about $2,000; the residents
from $2,300 down to $500 and less. These sums do not,
probably, constitute one-tenth of the receipts of their situations.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BOUNDARIES OF TIBET.</div>

<p>The third great division of the colonial part of the Chinese
empire, that of <span class="smcap">Tibet</span>, is less known than Ílí, though its area is
hardly less extensive. It constitutes the most southern of the
three great table lands of Central Asia, and is surrounded with
high mountains which separate it from all the contiguous regions.
The word Tibet or Tubet is unknown among the inhabitants
as the name of their country; it is a corruption by the
Mongols of <i>Tu po</i>,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> the country of the Tu, a race which overran
it in the sixth century; Turner gives another name, <i>Pue-koa-chim</i>,
signifying the ‘snowy country of the north,’ doubtless a
local or ancient term. The general appellation by the people is
<i>Pot</i> or <i>Bod</i>, or <i>Bod yul</i>&mdash;“the land of Bod.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> It is roughly
bounded northeast by Koko-nor; east by Sz’chuen and Yunnan;
south by Assam, Butan, Nípal, and Gurhwal; west by Cashmere;
and north by the unknown ranges of the Kwănlun Mountains.
The southern frontier curves considerably in its course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
but is not less than 1,500 miles from the western extremity of
Nípal to the province of Yunnan; the northern border is about
1,300 miles; the western frontiers cannot be accurately defined,
and depend more upon the possession of the passes through which
trade is carried on than any political separation. Beltistan,
Little Tibet, and Ladak, although included in its limits on
Chinese maps, have too little subjection or connection with the
court of Peking, to be reckoned among its dependencies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATURAL FEATURES OF TIBET.</div>

<p>Tibet, in its largest limits, is a table land, the highest plains
of which have a mean elevation of 11,510 feet, or about 1,300
feet lower than the plateau of Bolivia, near Lake Titicaca.
The snow-line on the north side of the Himalaya is at an altitude
of 16,630 feet; on the southern slope it is at 12,982 feet.
Several striking analogies may be traced between this country
and Peru: the tripartite divisions caused by lofty ranges; their
common staples of wool, from alpacas and vicunas in one, and
sheep and goats in the other; the abundance of precious
metals, and many specific customs. The entire province of
Tibet is divided by mountain chains into three distinct parts;
its western portion consists of the basin of the Indus, until
it breaks through into Cashmere at Makpon-i-Shagaron. It
begins near Mount Kailasa, and stretches northwest between
the Hindu Kush and Himalaya, comprising the whole of Beltistan
and Ladak; the Kara-korum, Mus-tag, or Tsung ling
range defines it on the northeast. The second part consists of
an extensive desert land, commencing at Mount Kailasa, and
having the Tsung ling on the west, the Kwănlun on the north
(which separates it from Khoten, and the high watershed of the
Yangtsz’, Salween, and other rivers), and Lake Tengkiri, on the
east; the Himalaya constitutes its southern boundary. This
high region, called Katshe or Kor-kache, has not been traversed
by intelligent travellers and is one of the few yet unknown regions
of the earth, and is nearly uninhabitable, owing to the
extreme rigor of its climate.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>
<p>The eastern part, consisting of the basin of the Yaru-tsangbu,
contains, in its plains, most of the towns in Tibet, until it
reaches the Alpine region which lies between the River Yaru
and the Yangtsz’, a space extending from long. 95° to 99° E.
This district is described as a succession of ridges and gorges,
over which the road takes the traveller on narrow and steep
paths, crossing the valleys by ropes and bridges enveloped in
the clouds. Mount Kailasa, a notable peak lying in the northeastern
part of Nari, is not far from 26,000 feet high. The
number of summits covered with perpetual snow exceeds that
of any other part of the world of the same extent.</p>

<p>The road from Sz’chuen to H’lassa strikes the Yalung kiang,
in the district of Ta tsien lu, and then goes southwesterly to
Batang on the Yangtsz’ kiang; crossing the river it proceeds
up the narrow valley a short distance, and then crosses the
mountains northwest to the Lantsan kiang or River Meikon, by
a series of pathways leading over the gorges, till it reaches
Tsiamdo; from this point the road turns gradually southwest,
following the valleys when practicable, till it ends at
H’lassa.</p>

<p>The largest river in Tibet is the Erechumbu, or Yaru-tsangbu;
<i>tsangbu</i> means river, and is often alone used for this whole
name. It rises in the Tamchuk range, at the Mariam-la pass
in Nari, 60 miles east of Lake Manasarowa, the source of the
Sutlej; it flows a little south of east for about seven hundred
miles, through the whole of Southern Tibet, between the first
and second ranges of the Himalayas, as far as long. 90° E.
Its tributaries on the north are numerous, and among them the
Nauk-tsangbu and Dzangtsu are the largest. The volume of
water which flows through the mountains into Assam by this
river, is equal to that by the Indus into Scinde. The disputed
question, whether the Yaru-tsangbu joins the Brahmaputra or
Irrawadi, has been settled by presumptive evidence in favor

the fall in this part is about 11,000 feet, to where the
river Dihong has been traced in Assam. This makes the Brah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>maputra
the largest and longest river in Southern Asia; its passage
into Assam is near 95° E. longitude.</p>

<p>The eastern part of Tibet, beyond this meridian, is traversed
by numerous ranges of lofty mountains, having no separate
names, the direction of which is from west to east, and from
northwest to southeast. From these ranges, lateral branches
run out in different directions, containing deep valleys between
them. In proportion as the principal chains advance towards
the southeast they converge towards one another, and thus the
valleys between them gradually become narrower, until at last,
on the frontiers of Yunnan and Burmah, they are mere mountain
passes, whose entire breadth does not much exceed a
hundred miles, having four streams flowing through them.
In fact, Tibet incloses the fountain heads of all the large rivers
of Southern and Eastern Asia. The names and courses of those
in Eastern Tibet are known only imperfectly from Chinese
maps, but others have described them after their entrance into
the lowlands.</p>

<p>Tibet, especially the central part, is a country of lakes, in this
respect resembling Cobdo. The largest, Tengkiri-nor, situated
in the midst of stupendous mountains, about one hundred and
ten miles northwest of H’lassa, is over a hundred miles long and
about thirty wide. The region north of it contains many isolated
lakes, most of them salt. Two of the largest, the Bouka
and Kara, are represented as connected with the River Nu.
Lake Khamba-la, Yamoruk or Yarbrokyu, sometimes called
Palti, from a town on its northern shore, is a large lake south of
H’lassa, remarkable for its ring shape, the centre being filled
by a large island, around which its waters flow in a channel
thirty miles or more in width. On the island is a nunnery,
called the Palace of the Holy Sow, said to be the finest in the
country. In Balti or Little Tibet are many sheets of water, the
largest of which, the Yik and Paha, are connected by a river
flowing through a marshy country. A long succession of lakes
fill one of the basins in Katsche, suggesting the former existence
of another Aral Sea. The sacred lakes of Manasarowa and
Ravan-hrad (Mapam-dalai and Langga-nor, of the Chinese)
form the headwaters of the Sutlej.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLIMATE, FOOD AND PRODUCTIONS.</div>

<p>The climate of Tibet is characterized by its purity and excessive
dryness. The valleys are hot, notwithstanding their proximity
to snow-capped mountains; from May to October the sky
is clear in the table-lands, and in the valleys the moisture and
temperature are favorable to vegetation, the harvest being gathered
before the gales and snows set in, after October. The
effects of the air resemble or are worse than those of the kamsín
in Egypt. The trees wither, and their leaves may be ground
to powder between the fingers; planks and beams break, and
the inhabitants cover the timbers and wood-work of their houses
with coarse cotton, in order to preserve them against the destructive
saccidity. The timber neither rots nor is worm-eaten.
Mutton, exposed to the open air, becomes so dry that it may be
powdered like bread; when once dried it is preserved during
years. This flesh-bread is a common food in Tibet. The carcass
of the animal, divested of its skin and viscera, is placed
where the frosty air will have free access to it, until all the
juices of the body dry up, and the whole becomes one stiffened
mass. No salt is used, nor does it ever become tainted, and is
eaten without any further dressing or cooking; the natives eat it
at all periods after it is frozen, and prefer the fresh to that which
has been kept some months. The food called <i>jamba</i> is prepared
by cooking brick tea during several hours, then adding butter
and salt, and stirring the mixture until it becomes a thick broth.
When eaten the stuff is served in wooden bowls, and a plentiful
supply of roasted barley-meal poured in, the whole being kneaded
by the hands and devoured in the shape of dough pellets.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Domesticated Yak.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The productions of Tibet consist of domestic animals, cattle,
horses, pigs; some wild animals, such as the white-breasted
argali, orongo-antelope, ata-dzeren, wolf, and steppe-fox; and few
plants or forests, presenting a strong contrast with Nípal and
Butan, where vegetable life flourishes more luxuriantly. Sheep
and goats are reared in immense flocks, for beasts of burden
over the passes, and for their flesh, hair, and coats. Chiefest
among the animals of this mountain land is the yak.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
domesticated variety, or long-haired yak, is the inseparable
companion and most trusty servant not only of the Tibetans,
but of tribes in Cashmere, Ladak, Tangout, and Mongolia, even
as far north as Urga. It is a cross-breed, or mule from the
yak bull and native cow, which alone is hardy enough for these
elevated regions.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> These creatures are of the same size as our cattle,
strong, sure-footed and possessed of extraordinary endurance;
they retain, however, something of their wild nature,
even after long domestication, and must be carefully treated,
especially when being loaded and unloaded. They thrive best
in hilly countries, well watered and covered with grass&mdash;the two
last being indispensable. The hair is black or black and white,
seldom entirely white. One sort is without horns, and when
crossed with the cow bears sterile males, or females which are
fertile for one generation. As to the wild yak of Tibet, a traveller
says: “This handsome animal is of extraordinary size and
beauty, measuring, when grown, eleven feet in length, exclusive
of its bushy tail, which is three feet long; its height at the
hump is six feet; girth around the body eleven feet, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
weight ten or eleven hundred weight. The head is adorned
with ponderous horns, two feet nine inches long, and one foot
four inches in circumference at the root. The body is covered
with thick, black hair, which in the old males assumes a chestnut
color on the back and upper parts of the sides, and a deep
fringe of black hair hangs down from the flanks. The muzzle
is partly gray, and the younger males have marks of the same
color on the upper part of the body, whilst a narrow, silvery-gray
stripe runs down the centre of the back. The hair of
young yaks is much softer than that of older ones; they are
also distinguishable by their smaller size, and by handsomer
horns, with the points turned up. The females are much
smaller than the males, and not nearly so striking in appearance;
their horns are shorter and lighter, the hump smaller,
and the tail and flanks not nearly as hairy.”<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> This animal is
useful for its milk, flesh, and wool, as well as for agricultural
purposes and travel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANIMALS OF TIBET.</div>

<p>There is comparatively little agriculture. The variety of
wild animals, birds, and fishes, is very great; among them the
musk deer, feline animals, eagles, and wild sheep, are objects
of the chase. The brute creation are generally clothed with an
abundance of fine hair or wool; even the horses have a shaggier
coat than is granted to bears in more genial climes. The
Tibetan mastiff is one of the largest and fiercest of its race,
almost untamable, and unknown out of its native country.
The musk deer is clothed with a thick covering of hair two or
three inches long, standing erect over the whole body; the
animal resembles a hog in size and form, having, however,
slender legs. The Tibetan goat affords the shawl wool, so
highly prized for the manufacture of garments.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Fruits are common; small peaches, grapes, apples, and nuts,
constitute the limited variety. Barley is raised more than any
other grain, the principal part of agricultural labors being performed
by the women. Pulse and wheat are cultivated, but no
rice west of H’lassa. Rhubarb, asafœtida, ginger, madder, and
safflower are collected or prepared, but most of the medicines
come from China and Butan. Turnips, rape, garlic, onions, and
melons are raised in small quantities. The mineral productions
are exceedingly rich. Gold occurs in mines and placer diggings,
and forms a constant article of export; lead, silver, copper, and
cinnabar are also dug out of the ground, but iron has not been
found to much extent. The great difficulty in the way of the
inhabitants availing themselves of their metallic wealth, apart
from their ignorance of the best modes of mining, is the want
of fuel with which to smelt the ore. Tincal, or crude borax,
is gathered on the borders of a small lake in the neighborhood
of Tengkiri-nor, where also any quantity of rock salt can be
obtained. Precious stones are met with, most of which find
their way to China.</p>

<p>The present divisions of Tibet, by the Chinese, are <i>Tsien
Tsang</i>, or Anterior Tibet, and <i>Hau Tsang</i>, or Ulterior Tibet.
Anterior Tibet is also called U (Wei) and U-tsang, and includes
the central part of Bod-yur where H’lassa is; east of
this lies Kham (Kăng) or Khamyul, and northeast toward
Koko-nor is Khamsok, <i>i.e.</i>, Kham on the River Sok. Near the
bend of the Brahmaputra is the district of Kongbo, where rice
can be raised; going westward are Takpo, doUs and gTsang on
the borders of Nari, ending in a line nearly continuous with
the eastern border of Nípal. The Chinese books mention eight
cantons in Anterior Tibet, five of them lying east of H’lassa,
added to which are thirty-nine feudal townships in Khamsok
called <i>tu-sz’</i>, all of them chiefly nominal or at present antiquated.
Csoma de Körös speaks of several small principalities
in Kham, and describes the inhabitants as differing from the
rest of the Tibetans in appearance and language; they assimilate
probably with the tribes on the Burman and Chinese frontiers.
Nari (A-li in Chinese) is divided into Mangyul, Khorsum,
and Maryul. The first of these districts lies nearly conter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>minous
with Nípal, and its area is probably about the same, but
its cold, dry, and elevated regions, support only a few shepherds;
Khorsum and Maryul lie north and northwest in a
still more inhospitable clime; the latter adjoins Ladak and
Balti and is the reservoir of hundreds of lakes situated from
12,000 to 15,000 feet above the sea. A ridge separates the
valley of the Indus from the Sutlej, crossed at the Bogola Pass,
19,220 feet high, and then over the Gugtila Pass, 19,500 feet
into Gartok. The people throughout this elevated region are
forced to live in tents, wood being almost unknown for building.</p>

<div class="sidenote">H’LASSA THE CAPITAL.</div>

<p>H’lassa, the <i>gyalsa</i> or capital of Tibet, is situated on the Kichu
River, about twelve leagues from its junction with the
Yaru, in lat. 29° 39′ N., and long. 91° 05′ E.; the name signifies
<i>God’s ground</i>, and it is the largest town in this part of Asia.
It is famous for the convents near it, composing the ecclesiastical
establishments of the Dalai (or ‘Ocean’)-lama, whose residence
is in the monastery of Pobrang-marbu (<i>i.e.</i>, ‘Red town’) on
Mount Putala. The principal building of this establishment is
three hundred and sixty-seven feet high, and it contains, as the
Chinese expression is, “a myriad of rooms.” This city is the
head-quarters of Buddhism, and the hierarchy of lamas, who, by
means of the Dalai-lama, and his subordinate the Kutuktu, exercise
priestly control over wellnigh all Mongolia as well as Tibet.
The city lies in a fertile plain nearly 12,000 feet high, about
twelve miles wide, and one hundred and twenty-five from north
to south, producing harvests of barley and millet, with abundant
pasturage and some fruit trees. Mountains and hills encircle it;
of these the westernmost is Putala, the river running so near its
base that a wall has been built to preserve the buildings from
the rise of the waters. The Chinese garrison is quartered
about two miles north of this mount, and two large temples,
called <i>H’lassa tso-kang</i> and <i>Ramotsie tso-kang</i>, resplendent with
gold and precious stones, stand very near it. The four monasteries,
Séra, Brebung, Samyé, and Galdan, constitute as many
separate establishments.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> During the sway of the Songares in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Ílí, their prince Arabdan made a descent upon H’lassa, and the
Lama was killed. Kanghí placed a new one upon the see, in
1720, appointing six leading officers of the old Lama to assist
him in the government. Three of these joined in an insurrection,
and in the conflicts which succeeded, H’lassa suffered considerably.
The population of the town is conjectured to be
24,000; that of the province is reckoned by Csoma at about
650,000.</p>

<p>The town was visited in the year 1811 by Mr. Manning,
whose description of its dirty and miserable streets swarming
with dogs and beggars, and the meanness of its buildings, corresponds
with what Huc and Gabet found in 1846. Mr. Manning
remained there nearly five months, and had several interviews
with the Dalai-lama; he was much impeded in his
observations by a Cantonese <i>munshí</i> or teacher, and exposed to
danger of illness from insufficient shelter and clothing. His
reception by the chief of the Buddhist faith on the 17th of
December, was equally remarkable with that by the Teshu-lama
of Bogle in 1774, and of Turner in 1783. Mr. Manning was
alone and unprotected and had very few presents, but his offering
was accepted; it consisted of a piece of fine broadcloth, two
brass candlesticks, twenty new dollars, and two vials of lavender
water. He rode to the foot of the mountain Putala, and
dismounted on the first platform to ascend by a long stairway
of four hundred steps, part of them cut in the rock, and the
rest ladder steps from story to story in the palace, till he
reached a large platform roof off which was the reception hall.
Upon entering this he found that the <i>Tí-mu-fu</i> or <i>Gesub Rimboché</i>,
the highest civil functionary in Tibet, was also present,
which caused him some confusion: “I did not know how
much ceremony to go through with one before I began with
the other. I made the due obeisance, touching the ground
three times with my head to the Grand Lama, and once to the
<i>Tí-mu-fu</i>. I presented my gifts, delivering the coins with a
handsome silk scarf with my own hands to them both. While
I was <i>kotowing</i>, the awkward servants let one of the bottles of
lavender water fall and break. Having delivered the scarf to
the Grand Lama, I took off my hat, and humbly gave him my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
clean shaven head to lay his hands upon.... The Lama’s
beautiful and interesting face and manner engrossed all my attention.
He was about seven years old; had the simple manners
of a well educated princely child. His face was, I thought,
poetically and affectingly beautiful. He was of a cheerful disposition,
his beautiful mouth perpetually unbending into a
graceful smile, which illuminated his whole countenance. No
doubt my grim beard and spectacles excited his risibility. We
had not been seated long before he put questions which we rose
to receive and answer. He inquired whether I had met with
difficulties on the road; to which I replied that I had had
troubles, but now that I had the happiness of being in his presence
they were amply compensated. I could see that this
answer pleased both him and his people, for they found that I
was not a mere rustic, but had some tincture of civility in me.”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SHIGATSÉ AND TESHU-LUMBO.</div>

<p>The capital of Tsang or Ulterior Tibet is Shigatsé, situated 126
miles west of H’lassa, and under its control. The monastery
where the Teshu-lama and his court resides is a few miles
distant, and constitutes a town of about 4,000 priests, named
Teshu-Lumbo. He is styled Panchen Rimboché, and is the
incarnation of Amitabha Buddha. His palace is built of dark
brick and has a roof of gilded copper; the houses rise one
above another and the gilt ornaments on the temples combine
to give a princely appearance to the town. The fortress of
Shigatsé stands so as to command both places. The plain
between this town and H’lassa is a fertile tract, and judging
from the number of towns in the valleys of the basin of the
Yaru, its productive powers are comparatively great. Ulterior
Tibet is divided into six other cantons, besides the territory
under the jurisdiction of the chief town, most of their fortified
capitals lying westward of Shigatsé.</p>

<p>The degree of skill the Tibetans have attained in manufactures,
mechanical arts, and general civilization, is less than
that of the Chinese, but superior to the Mongols. They appear
to be a mild and humane people, possessing a religious sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and enjoying an easy life compared with their southern neighbors.
They are well-bred and affable, fond of gossiping and
festivities, which soften the heart and cheer the temper. Women
are treated with care and are not often compelled to work
out of doors. No two people or countries widely separated
present a stronger contrast than do the stout, tall, muscular, and
florid Butías, upon their fertile fields and wooded hills, with the
squat, puny, sluggish, and swarthy Tibetans in their rugged,
barren mountains. They distinguish five sorts of people among
themselves, the last of whom are the Butías; the others are
the inhabitants of Kham, or Anterior Tibet, those in Tsang, the
nomads of Kor-kache, and the people of Little Tibet. All of
them speak Tibetan with some variations. The Tibetans are
clad with woollens and furs to such a degree that they appear
to emulate the animals they derive them from in their weight
and warmth; and with this clothing is found no small quantity
of dirt. The dress of the sexes varies slightly in its shape;
yellow and red are the predominant colors. Large bulgar boots
of hide are worn by all persons; the remainder of the dress
consists of woollen robes and furs like those of the Chinese.
The women wear many jewels, and adorn their hair as do the
Mongols with pearls, coral, and turquoises. Girls braid their
hair in three tresses, married women in two. The head is protected
by high velvet caps; the men wear broad-brimmed
coverings of various materials.</p>

<p>The two religious sects are distinguished by yellow and red
caps; the latter are comparatively few, allow marriage to the
lamas, but do not differ materially in their ritual or tenets.
There is no country where so large a proportion of the people
are devoted to religious service as in Tibet, nor one where the
secular part of the inhabitants pays such implicit deference to
the clergy. The food of the Tibetans is taken at all hours,
mutton, barley, and tea constituting the staple articles. On
all visits tea is presented, and the cup replenished as often as it
is drained. Spirits and beer, both made from barley, are common
beverages. On every visit of ceremony, and whenever a
letter is sent from one person to another, it is necessary to connect
a silk scarf with it, the size and texture being proportioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to the rank and condition of the parties. The sentence <i>Om
mani padmí hum</i> is woven upon each end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OM MANI PADMÍ HÛM.</div>

<p>The following note by Col. Yule, condensed from Koeppen’s
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lamaische Hierarchie und Kirche</cite>, contains the most satisfactory
explanation of this puzzling mystic formula: “Om mani
padmí hûm!&mdash;the primeval six syllables, as the lamas say,
among all prayers on earth form that which is most abundantly
recited, written, printed, and even spun by machines for the
good of the faithful. These syllables form the only prayer
known to the ordinary Tibetans and Mongols; they are the first
words that the child learns to stammer, and the last gasping
utterance of the dying. The wanderer murmurs them on his
way, the herdsman beside his cattle, the matron at her household
tasks, the monk in all the stages of contemplation (<i>i.e.</i>, of
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">far niente</i>); they form at once a cry of battle and a shout of
victory! They are to be read wherever the Lama church
hath spread, upon banners, upon rocks, upon trees, upon walls,
upon monuments of stone, upon household utensils, upon strips
of paper, upon human skulls and skeletons! They form, according
to the idea of the believers, the utmost conception of all
religion, of all wisdom, of all revelation, the path of rescue and
the gate of salvation!... Properly and literally these
four words, a single utterance of which is sufficient of itself
to purchase an inestimable salvation, signify nothing more
than: “O the Jewel in the Lotus! Amen!” In this interpretation,
most probably, the <i>Jewel</i> stands for the Bodhisatva
Avalokiteçvara, so often born from the bud of a lotus flower.
According to this the whole formula is simply a salutation to
the mighty saint who has taken under his especial charge the
conversion of the North, and with him who first employed it
the mystic formula meant no more than <i>Ave Avalokiteçvara!</i>
But this simple explanation of course does not satisfy the Lama
schoolmen, who revel in glorifications and multitudinous glossifications
of this formula. The six syllables are the heart of
hearts, the root of all knowledge, the ladder to re-birth in
higher forms of being, the conquerors of the five evils, the
flame that burns up sin, the hammer that breaks up torment,
and so on. <i>Om</i> saves the gods, <i>ma</i> the Asuras, <i>ni</i> the men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
<i>pad</i> the animals, <i>mí</i> the spectre world of <i>pretâs</i>, <i>hûm</i> the inhabitants
of hell! <i>Om</i> is ‘the blessing of self-renunciation,
<i>ma</i> of mercy, <i>ni</i> of chastity, etc.’ ‘Truly monstrous,’ says
Koeppen, ‘is the number of <i>padmís</i> which in the great festivals
hum and buzz through the air like flies.’ In some places
each worshipper reports to the highest Lama how many <i>om
manis</i> he has uttered, and the total number emitted by the
congregation is counted by the billion.”</p>

<p>Grueber and Dorville describe <i>Manipe</i> as an idol, before
which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stulta gens insolitis gesticulationibus sacra sua facit,
identiden verba haec repetens</i>:&mdash;‘O Manipe, mi hum, O Manipe,
mi hum; <i>id est</i> Manipe, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">salva nos</span>!’ Rémusat (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mélanges
Posthumes</cite>, Paris, 1843, p. 99) translates this phrase by:
“Adoration, O thou precious stone who art in the lotus!” and
observes that it illustrates the fundamental dogma of Buddhism,
viz.: the production of the material universe by an absolute
being; all things which exist are shut up in the breast of the
divine substance; the ‘precious stone’ signifying that <i>the
world is in God</i>. Mr. Jameson says that the sentence <i>Om
mani padmí hung</i> is formed of the initial letters of various
deities, all of whom are supposed to be implored in the prayer.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>In reverential salutations, the cap is removed by the inferior,
and the arms hang by the side. The bodies of the dead are
placed in an open inclosure, in the same manner as practised by
the Parsees, where birds and beasts of prey devour them, or
they are dismembered in an exposed place. Lamas are burned,
and their ashes collected into urns. As soon as the breath has
departed, the body is seated in the same attitude as Buddha is
represented, with the legs bent before, and the soles of the feet
turned upwards. The right hand rests upon the thigh, the
left turns up near the body, the thumb touching the shoulder.
In this attitude of contemplation, the corpse is burned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TIBETAN TYPES AND CUSTOMS.</div>

<p>In Tibet, as in Butan, the custom of polyandry prevails. The
choice of a wife lies with the eldest son, who having made
known his intentions to his parents sends a matchmaker to pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>pose
the matter to the parents of the girl. The consent of the
parents being obtained, the matchmaker places an ornament of
a jewel set in gold, called <i>sedzia</i> upon the head of the damsel,
and gives her presents of jewels, dresses, cattle, etc., according
to the means of the young man. The guests invited on the
day of the marriage bring presents of such things as they
choose, which augments the dowry. A tent is set up before
the bride’s house, in which are placed three or four square
cushions, and the ground around sprinkled with wheat; the
bride is seated on the highest cushion, her parents and friends
standing near her according to their rank, and the assembled
party there partake of a feast. The bride is then conducted to
the house of her lover by the friends present, her person being
sprinkled with wheat or barley as she goes along, and there
placed by his side, and both of them served with tea and spirits.
Soon after, the groom seats himself apart, and every one present
gives a scarf, those of superior rank binding them around their
necks, equals and inferiors laying them by their sides. The
next day, a procession is formed of the relatives of the newly
married pair, which visits all the friends, and the marriage is
completed. The girl thus becomes the wife of all the brothers,
and manages the domestic concerns of their household. The
number of her husbands is sometimes indicated by as many
points in her cap. This custom is strengthened by the desire,
on the part of the family, to keep the property intact among
its members; but it does not prevent one of the husbands leaving
the roof and marrying another woman, nor is the usage
universal. Rémusat speaks of a novel in Tibetan, in which the
author admirably portrays the love of his heroine, Triharticha,
for her four lovers, and brings their marriage in at the end in
the happiest manner.</p>

<p>The dwellings of the poor are built of unhewn stones, rudely
piled upon each other without cement, two stories high, and
resembling brick-kilns in shape and size; the windows are
small, in order not to weaken the structure; the roof is flat, defended
by a brushwood parapet, and protected from the molestation
of evil spirits by flags, strips of paper tied to strings, or
branches of trees. Timber is costly and little used; the floors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
are of marble or tiles, and the furniture consists of little else
than mats and cushions. The temples and convents are more
imposing and commodious structures; some of those at H’lassa
are among the noblest specimens of architecture in Central
Asia.</p>

<p>The mausoleum of the Teshu-lama at Teshu Lumbu resembles
a plain square watch-tower surmounted by a double Chinese
canopy roof, the eaves of which are hung with bells, on which
the breeze plays a ceaseless dirge. The body of the lama reposes
in a coffin of gold, and his effigy, also of gold, is placed
within the concavity of a large shell upon the top of the pyramidal
structure which contains it. The sides of the pyramid
are silver plates, and on the steps are deposited the jewels and
other costly articles which once appertained to him. An altar
in front receives the oblations and incense daily presented before
the tomb, and near by is a second statue of the deceased as
large as life in the attitude of reading. Scrolls and pennons of
silk hang from the ceiling, and the walls are adorned with
paintings of priests engaged in prayer. The whole structure is
substantially built, and its rich ornaments are placed there not
less for security than to do honor to the revered person deposited
beneath. The windows are closed with mohair curtains,
and a skylight in the upper story serves for lighting the room,
and for passing out upon the roof. The roof or parapet is
ornamented with cylinders of copper or other materials, which
imparts a brilliant appearance to the edifices.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMMERCE AND LANGUAGE OF TIBET.</div>

<p>The manufactures of Tibet consist of woollens, cloth, blankets,
yarn, goat-hair shawls, musk, paper, metals, and jewelry.
Their lapidaries cut every kind of ornament in superior style,
and gold and silverware forms a considerable article of trade to
China. These and other crafts must necessarily languish, however,
from the immense proportion of men who are withdrawn
from labor into monasteries, compelling the residue to devote
most of their strength to tillage. The most important exports
to China consist of gold dust, precious stones, bezoars, asafœtida,
musk, woollens, and skins; for which the people receive
silks, teas, chinaware, tobacco, musical instruments, and metals.
The trade is carried on through Síning fu in Kansuh, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Batang in Sz’chuen. Tincal, rock-salt, and shawl wool, are additional
articles sent to Ladak, Butan, and India.</p>

<p>Music is studied by the priesthood for their ceremonies, and
with much better effect than among the Chinese priests. Their
amusements consist in archery, dancing, and observance of
many festivals connected with the worship of the dead or of
the living. Dram-drinking is common, but the people cannot
be called a drunken race, nor does the habit of opium eating or
smoking, so fatally general in Assam, prevail, inasmuch as the
poppy cannot well be cultivated among the mountains.</p>

<p>Education is confined to the priesthood, but the women, who
conduct much of the traffic, also learn arithmetic and writing.
The language is alphabetical, and reads from left to right;
there are two forms of the character, the <i>uchen</i> used for books,
and the <i>umin</i> employed in writing, which do not differ more
than the Roman and the running-hand in English. The form
of the characters shows their Sanscrit origin, but there are
many consonants in the language not found in that tongue, and
silent letters are not unfrequent in the written words. There
are thirty consonants in the alphabet, distributed into eight
classes, with four additional vowel signs; each of them ends in
a short <i>a</i>, as <i>ka</i>, <i>nga</i>, <i>cha</i>, which can be lengthened by a diacritical
mark placed underneath. The syllables are separated
from each other by a point; the accented consonant is that
which follows the vowel, and the others, whether before or
after it, are pronounced as rapidly as possible, and not unfrequently
omitted altogether in speaking. The variations in this
respect constitute the chief features of the patois found in different
parts where Tibetan is spoken. A dictionary and grammar<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
of this language were printed in 1834 in Calcutta by Csoma de
Körös, a Hungarian who resided among the priests near Ladak.
The literature is almost wholly theological, as far as it has been
examined, and such works as are not of this character, have
probably been introduced from China. Their divisions of time,
numeration, chronology, and weights, have also been adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
from that country with a few alterations. An Englishman,
Mr. Brian Hodgson, who lived in Nípal from 1820 to 1843, has
added more than any one else to our knowledge of the literature
of this country. This gentleman procured complete copies of
the original documents of the Buddhist canon preserved in Sanscrit
in Nípalese monasteries, as well as (by a present from the
Dalai-lama) the whole of the existing literary remains of the
once flourishing Christian mission at H’lassa. His more important
essays on these lands have now been brought together in a
single volume.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HISTORY OF TIBET.</div>

<p>The history of Tibet has been made partially known to Europe
through the Mongol author, Sanang Setsen,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> but if free
access could be had to their annals, it is probable that a methodical
history could be extracted, reaching back at least three
centuries before Christ. Tibet was ruled by its own princes
till the rise of Genghis; the first monarch, who united the
various tribes under his sway <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 313, was Seger-Sandilutu-Kagan-Tül-Esen,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
and from the fact that Buddhism was introduced
during his reign, it might be inferred that he came from
the south. H’lassa was founded by Srongzan-Gambo, or Srongbdzan
sgambouo,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 630, after which time Tibetan
history becomes more authentic, inasmuch as this king introduced
the alphabet. The Tang dynasty carried their arms into
Tibet from Khoten, but the people threw off their yoke during
the decline of that family. Mohammedanism also disturbed the
supremacy of the Buddhist faith, and severe persecutions followed
about the beginning of the tenth century by an Islam
prince Darma, but it was repelled at his death, and has never
since made the least impression upon the people. Genghis reduced
Tangout, one of the principalities, northeast of Koko-nor,
and soon after brought the whole country under his sway; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Kublai still further settled as a dependency of his empire.
The people recovered their independence on the expulsion of
the Mongols, and under the Ming dynasty formed several small
kingdoms, among which were Ladak and Rodok, both of them
still existing.</p>

<p>From a short résumé of letters written from Tibet in 1626,
by Romish missionaries living there, it appears that the kingdom
of Sopo was the most powerful in the north, and Cogué,
U-tsang, and Maryul were three southern principalities. The
king of Cogué allowed these missionaries to reside in his territories,
and took pleasure in hearing them converse and dispute
with the lamas. The Dalai-lama at this time was the king’s
brother, and possessed subordinate influence in the state, but
the priests were numerous and influential. The conquest of
Mongolia and Tangout opened the way for Kanghí to enter
Tibet, but the intercourse between the Emperor and Dalai-lama
was chiefly connected with religion and carrying tribute. An
index of the freedom of communication between Tibet and the
west is found in the passports issued to the traders visiting
H’lassa in 1688. The lamas held the supreme power until
towards the end of his reign, when Chinese influence became
paramount. The country had already been conquered by the
Songar chieftain, so that on his defeat it could offer little resistance.
Kanghí appointed six of the highest princes or <i>gialbo</i>
over the provinces; but soon after his death, in 1727, three of
them conspired against Yungching, and were not subdued without
considerable resistance. The Emperor then appointed the
loyal prince or <i>gialbo</i> as governor-general, and he remained in
his vice-regal office till his death, about 1750. Kienlung, finding
that his son was endeavoring to make himself fully independent,
executed him as a rebel, suppressed the office, and
appointed two Chinese generals to be associated with the Dalai-lama
and his coadjutor, in the administration of the country.
The troops were increased and forts erected in all parts of the
country to awe the people and facilitate trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOVERNMENT OF TIBET.</div>

<p>The present government of Tibet is superintended by two
<i>ta chin</i>, or ‘great ministers,’ residing at H’lassa, who act conjointly,
while they serve as checks upon each other; they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
not hold their office for a long time. They have absolute control
over all the troops in the country, and the military are
generally confined to the garrisons, and do not cultivate the
soil. The collection of revenue, transmission of tribute to
Peking, and direction of the persons who carry it, and those
who conduct the trade at Batang and Síning fu, are all under
their control. The Dalai-lama, and the Teshu-lama are the high
religious officers of the country, each of them independent in
his own province, but the former holding the highest place in
the hierarchy. The Chinese residents confer with each concerning
the direction of his own province. All their appointments
to office or nobility must be sanctioned by the residents
before they are valid, but merely religious officers are not
under this surveillance. In the villages, the authority is administered
by secular deputy lamas called <i>deba</i>, and by commandants
called <i>karpon</i>, who are sent from the capital. Each <i>deba</i>
is assisted by a native <i>vazir</i> of the place, who, with the chief
lama, form the local government, amenable to the supreme
magistracy. The western province of Nari is peopled by nomads,
who wander over the regions north of Ravan-hrad, and
are under the authority of <i>karpons</i> sent from H’lassa, without
the assistance of lamas. The two high-priests themselves are
likewise assisted by councillors. One of these, called Soopoon
Choomboo, who held the office of <i>sadeek</i> or adviser when Turner
visited Teshu-Lumbo, was a Manchu by birth, but had
long lived in Tibet.</p>

<p>The nomadic clans of Dam Mongols and other tribes occupying
the thirty-nine feudal townships or <i>tu-sz’</i> in Anterior Tibet,
are governed by the residents without the intervention of the
lamas. The disturbances in Ulterior Tibet in 1792, resulting
from the irruption of the Nípalese and sack of Teshu-Lumbo,
were speedily quelled by the energy of Kienlung’s government,
and the invaders forced to sue for mercy. The southern frontier
was, in consequence of this inroad, strongly fortified by a
chain of posts, and the communication with the states between
Tibet and India strictly forbidden and watched. It gave the
Chinese an opportunity to strengthen their rule and extend
their influence north to Khoten and into Ladak. The natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
mildness of character of the Tibetans, and similarity of religion
renders them much easier under the Chinese yoke, than
the Mohammedans.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">POPULATION AND STATISTICS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Much of the interest appertaining to the country and people
here treated of, in the minds of philanthropic and intelligent
men, has arisen from the impression they have received of its
vast population. A country twice the size of the Chinese empire
would present few attractions to the Christian, the merchant,
or the ethnologist, if it were no better inhabited than
Sahara, or Arizona: a people might possess most admirable
institutions, and a matchless form of government, yet these
excellencies would lose their interest, did we hear that it is the
republic of San Marino or the kingdom of Muscat, where they
are found. The population of few countries in the world has
been accurately ascertained, and probably that of China is less
satisfactory than any European or American state of the present
day. It is far easier to take a census among a people who
understand its object, and will honestly assist in its execution,
than in a despotic, half-civilized country, where the mass of
the inhabitants are afraid of contact or intercourse with their
rulers; in most of such states, as Abyssinia, Turkey, Persia,
etc., there is either no regular enumeration at all, or merely a
general estimate for the purposes of revenue or conscription.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CREDIT DUE TO CHINESE CENSUSES.</div>

<p>The subject of the population of China has engaged the
attention of the monarchs of the present dynasty, and their
censuses have been the best sources of information in making
up an intelligent opinion upon the matter. Whatever may be
our views of the actual population, it is plain that these censuses,
with all their discrepancies and inaccuracies, are the only
reliable sources of information. The conflicting opinions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
conclusions of foreign writers neither give any additional weight
to them, nor detract at all from their credibility. As the question
stands at present, they can be doubted, but cannot be
denied; it is impossible to prove them, while there are many
grounds for believing them; the enormous total which they
exhibit can be declared to be improbable, but not shown to be
impossible.</p>

<p>No one who has been in China can hesitate to acknowledge
that there are some strong grounds for giving credit to them,
but the total goes so far beyond his calculations, that entire
belief must, indeed, be deferred till some new data have
been furnished. There are, perhaps, more peculiar encouragements
to the increase of population there than in any other
country, mostly arising from a salubrious climate, semi-annual
crops, unceasing industry, early marriages, and an equable
taxation, involving reasonable security of life and property.
Turning to other countries of Asia, we soon observe that in
Japan and Persia these causes have less influence; in Siam
and Burmah they are weak; in Tibet they are almost powerless.</p>

<p>At this point every one must rest, as the result of an examination
into the population of the Chinese Empire; though,
from the survey of its principal divisions, made in the preceding
chapters, its capability of maintaining a dense population needs
no additional evidence. The mind, however, is bewildered in
some degree by the contemplation of millions upon millions of
human beings thus collected under one government; and it
almost wishes there might be grounds for disbelieving the
enormous total, from the dreadful results that might follow
the tyrannical caprice or unrestrained fury of their rulers,
or the still more shocking scenes of rapine and the hideous
extremities of want which a bad harvest would necessarily
cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MA TWAN-LIN’S STUDY OF THE CENSUSES.</div>

<p>Chinese literature contains many documents describing
classes of society comprised in censuses in the various dynasties.
The results of those enumerations have been digested by Ma
Twan-lin in a judicious and intelligent manner in the chapters
treating on population, from which M. Ed. Biot has elaborated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
many important data.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The early records show that the census
was designed to contain only the number of taxable people, excluding
all persons bound to give personal service, who were
under the control of others. Moreover, all officials and slaves,
all persons over 60 or 66 years of age, the weak or sick, those
needing help, and sometimes such as were newly placed on state
lands, were likewise omitted. Deducting these classes, Ma
Twan-lin gives one census taken in the ninth century, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, as
13,704,923 persons, between the ages of 15 and 65, living
within the frontiers north of the Yangtsz’ River. This figure
would be worth, according to the tables of modern statistics,
about 65 per cent. of the entire population, or as representing
21,753,528 inhabitants.</p>

<p>The mighty conqueror, Tsin Chí Hwangtí, changed the personal
corvée to scutage, and introduced a kind of poll-tax, by
accepting the money from many who could not be forced to do
the work required. This practice was followed in the Han
dynasty, and in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 194, the poll-tax was legalized, to include
all men between 15 and 66, while a lighter impost was levied
on those between 7 and 14. During the four centuries of this
family’s régime, the object and modes of a census were well
understood. Ma Twan-lin gives the results of ten taken between
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 2 and 155. His details show that it was done
simply for revenue, and was omitted in bad years, when drought
or freshets destroyed the harvests; they show, too, an increase
in the number of slaves, that women were now enumerated,
and that girls between 15 and 30 paid a poll-tax. In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 30,
the limits of age were placed between 7 and 56. The average
of these ten censuses is 63,500,600, the first one being as high
as 83,640,000, while the next and lowest, taken fifty-five years
afterwards, is only 29,180,000, and the third is 47,396,000.
These great variations are explained by the disturbances arising
in consequence of the usurpation of Wangmang, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 9-27, and
subsequent change of the capital, and the impossibility, during
this troubled period, of canvassing all parts of the Empire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
The inference from these data, that the real population of the
Chinese Empire north of the Nan ling at the time of Christ was
at least eighty millions, is as well grounded as almost any fact
in its history.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>After the downfall of the Han dynasty, a long period of
civil war ensued, in which the destruction of life and property
was so enormous that the population was reduced to one-sixth
of the amount set down in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 230, when disease, epidemics,
and earthquakes increased the losses caused by war and the cessation
of agriculture, according to Ma Twan-lin; and it is not
till <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 280, when the Tsin dynasty had subjected all to its
sway, that the country began to revive. In that year an enumeration
was made which stated the free people between 12
and 66 years in the land at 14,163,863, or 23,180,000 in all.
From this period till the Sui dynasty came into power, in 589,
China was torn by dissensions and rival monarchs, and the
recorded censuses covered only a portion of the land, the figures
including even fewer of the people, owing to the great number
of serfs or bondmen who had sought safety under the protection
of landowners. At this time a new mode of taking the census
was ordered, in which the people were classified into those from
1 to 3 years, then 3 to 10, then 10 to 17, and 17 to 60, after
which age they were not taxed; the ratio of the land tax was
also fixed. A census taken in 606 in this way gives an estimated
population of 46,019,956 in all China; the frontiers, at
this period, hardly reached to the Nan ling Mountains, and the
author’s explanation of the manner of carrying on some public
works shows that even this sum did not include persons who were
liable to be called on for personal service, while all officials, slaves,
and beggars were omitted. Troubles arose again from these
enforced works, and it was not till the advent to power of the
Tang dynasty, in 618, that a regular enumeration was possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>This family reigned 287 years, and Ma Twan-lin gives fifteen
returns of the population up to 841. They show great variations,
some of them difficult to explain even by omitting or
supplying large classes of the inhabitants. The one most carefully
taken was in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 754, and gives an estimated total of
about seventy millions for the whole Empire, which, though
nearly the same as that in the Han dynasty in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 2, extended
over a far greater area, even to the whole southern seaboard.
In addition to former enumerated classes, many thousands of
priests were passed by in this census.</p>

<p>The years of anarchy following the Tang, till <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 976, when
the Sung dynasty obtained possession, caused their usual effect.
Its first census gives only about sixteen millions of taxable population
that year, when its authority was not firmly assured; but
in 1021 the returns rise to 43,388,380, and thence gradually
increase to 100,095,250 in 1102, just before the provinces north
of the Yellow River, by far the most fertile and loyal, were lost.
The last enumeration, in 1223, while Ma Twan-lin was living,
places the returns in the southern provinces at 63,304,000; this
was fifty years before Kublai khan conquered the Empire. Our
author gives some details concerning the classes included in the
census during his own lifetime, which prove to a reasonable
mind that the real number of mouths living on the land was, if
anything, higher than the estimates. In 1290, the Mongol
Emperor published his enumeration, placing the taxable population
at 58,834,711, “not counting those who had fled to the
mountains and lakes, or who had joined the rebels.” This was
not long after his ruthless hand had almost depopulated vast
regions in the northern provinces, before he could quiet them.</p>

<p>In the continuation of Ma Twan-lin’s <cite>Researches</cite>, there are
sixteen censuses given for the Ming dynasty between 1381 and
1580; the lowest figure is 46,800,000, in 1506, and the highest,
66,590,000, in 1412, the average for the two centuries being
56,715,360 inhabitants. One of its compilers declares that he
cannot reconcile their great discrepancies, and throws doubts on
their totals from his inability to learn the mode of enumeration.
Three are given for three consecutive years (1402-1404), the
difference between the extremes of which amounts to sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
millions, but they were all taken when Yungloh was fighting
Kienwăn, his nephew, at Nanking, and settling himself at
Peking as Emperor, during which years large districts could not
possibly have been counted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMPARATIVE CENSUS TABLES.</div>

<p>Before entering upon a careful examination of this question,
it will be well to bring together the various estimates taken of
the population during the present dynasty. The details given
in the table on page <a href="#Page_264">264</a> have been taken from the best sources,

<p>Seven of these censuses, viz., the 7th, 8th, 12th, 13th, 17th,
20th, 21st and 23d, are given in detail in the following table.
The first three belong to the Ming dynasty, and are taken from
a continuation of Ma Twan-lin’s <cite>Researches</cite>, whence they were
quoted in the <cite>Mirror of History</cite>, without their details. During
the Ming dynasty, a portion of the country now called the
Eighteen Provinces, was not under the control of Hungwu and
his descendants. The wars with the Japanese, and with tribes
on the north and west, together with the civil wars and struggles
between the Chinese themselves, and with the Nü-chí in
Manchuria, must have somewhat decreased the population.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CENSUSES INDIVIDUALLY CONSIDERED.</div>

<p>The first census of 1662 (No. 4), is incidentally mentioned by
Kienlung in 1791, as having been taken at that time, from his
making some observations upon the increase of the population
and comparing the early censuses with the one he had recently
ordered. This sum of 21,068,600 does not, however, include
all the inhabitants of China at that date; for the Manchus
commenced their sway in 1644, and did not exercise full authority
over all the provinces much before 1700; Canton was
taken in 1650, Formosa in 1683.</p>

<p>The census of 1668 (No. 5), shows a little increase over that
of 1662, but is likewise confined to the conquered portions; and
in those provinces which had been subdued, there were extensive
tracts which had been almost depopulated at the conquest.
Any one who reads the recitals of Semedo, Martini, Trigautius,
and others, concerning the massacres and destruction of life
both by the Manchus and by Chinese bandits, between 1630
and 1650, will feel no loss in accounting for the diminution of
numbers, down to 1710. But the chief explanation of the decrease
from sixty to twenty-seven millions is to be found in the
object of taking the census, viz., to levy a poll-tax, and get at
the number of men fit for the army&mdash;two reasons for most men
to avoid the registration.</p>

<p>The census of 1711 (No. 8), is the first one on record which
bears the appearance of credibility, when its several parts are
compared with each other. The dates of the preceding (Nos.
6 and 7), are rather uncertain; the last was extracted by Dr.
Morrison from a book published in 1790, and he thought it
was probably taken as early as 1650, though that is unlikely.
The other is given by Dr. Medhurst without any explanation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and their great disparity leads us to think that both are dated
wrongly. The census of 1711 is much more consistent in itself,
though there are some reasons for supposing that neither did it
include all the population then in China. The census was still
taken for enrolment in the army, and to levy a capitation tax
upon all males between the ages of sixteen and sixty. But
this tax and registration were evaded and resisted by the indignant
Chinese, who had never been chronicled in this fashion by
their own princes; the Emperor Kanghí, therefore, abolished
the capitation tax. It was not till about this time that the
Manchus had subdued and pacified the southern provinces, and
it is not improbable that this census, and the survey taken by
the Jesuits, were among their acts of sovereignty. Finding
the people unwilling to be registered, the poll tax was merged
in the land tax, and no census ordered during the reign of
Yungching, till Kienlung revived it in order to have some
guide in apportioning relief during seasons of distress and scarcity,
establishing granaries, and aiding the police in their duties.
Many, therefore, who would do all in their power to prevent
their names being taken, when they were liable to be taxed or
called on to do military service, could have no objection to
come forward, when the design of the census was to benefit
themselves. It matters very little, however, for what object the
census was taken, if there is reason to believe it to have been
accurate. It might indeed act as a stimulus to multiply names
and figures whom there were no people to represent, as the
principle of paying the marshals a percentage on the numbers
they reported did in some parts of New York State in 1840.</p>

<p>The three next numbers (9, 10, and 11), are taken from De
Guignes, who quotes Amiot, but gives no Chinese authorities.
The last is given in full by De Guignes, and both this and that
of Allerstein, dated twenty years after, are introduced into the
table. There are some discrepancies between these two and
the census of 1753, taken from the <cite>General Statistics</cite>, which
cannot easily be reconciled. The internal evidence is in favor
of the latter, over the census of 1743; it is taken from a new
edition of the <cite>Ta Tsing Hwui Tien</cite>, or ‘General Statistics of
the Empire,’ and the increase during the forty-two years which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
had elapsed since the last census is regular in all the provinces,
with the exception of Shantung and Kiangnan. The extraordinary
fertility of these provinces would easily induce immigration,
while in the war of conquest, their populousness and
wealth attracted the armies of the Manchus, and the destruction
of life was disproportionably great. The smaller numbers
given to the western and southern provinces correspond
moreover to the opposition experienced in those regions.
On the whole, the census taken in 1753 compares very well
with that of 1711, and both of them bear an aspect of verity,
which does not belong to the table of 1743 quoted by De
Guignes.</p>

<p>From 1711 to 1753, the population doubled itself in about
twenty-two years, premising that the whole country was faithfully
registered at the first census. For instance, the province
of Kweichau, in 1711, presents on the average a mere fraction
of a little more than a single person to two square miles; while
in 1753 it had increased in the unexampled ratio of three to a
square mile, which is doubling its population every seven years;
Kwangtung, Kwangsí, and Kansuh (all of them containing to
this day, partially subdued tribes), had also multiplied their
numbers in nearly the same proportion, owing in great measure,
probably, to the more extended census than to the mere increase
of population.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMPARISON OF LATER CENSUSES.</div>

<p>The amounts for 1736, three of 1743, and those of 1760,
1761, and 1762 (Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, and 17), are all extracted
from De Guignes, who took them from the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires
sur les Chinois</cite>. The last, that of 1762, is given in detail in the
table. The discrepancy of sixty millions between that given
by Amiot for 1760, and that by Dr. Morrison for the same
year, is owing, there can be little doubt, to foreigners, and not
to an error of the Chinese. The work from which Dr. Morrison
extracted his estimate for that year was published in 1790,
but the census was taken between 1760 and 1765. The same
work contains the census of 1711 (No. 8), quoted by him, and
there is good cause for believing that Amiot’s or Grosier’s
estimate of 157,343,975 for 1743, is the very same census, he
having multiplied the number 28,605,716 by five, supposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
them to have been families and not individuals. The three
ascribed to the year 1743, are probably all derived from the
same native authorities by different individuals.</p>

<p>The three dated in 1760, 1761, and 1762, are harmonious
with each other; but if they are taken, those of 1753 and 1760,
extracted from the <cite>Yih Tung Chí</cite> by Dr. Morrison, must be
rejected, which are far more reasonable, and correspond better
with the preceding one of 1711. It may be remarked, that by
reckoning five persons to a family in calculating the census
of 1753, as Amiot does for 1743, the population would be
189,223,820 instead of 103,050,060, as given in the table. This
explains the apparent decrease of fifty millions. All the discrepancies
between these various tables and censuses must not
be charged upon the Chinese, since it is by no means easy to
ascertain their modes of taking the census and their use of
terms. In the tables, for example, they employ the phrase <i>jin-ting</i>,
for a male over 15 years of age, as the integer; this has,
then, to be multiplied by some factor of increase to get at the
total population; and this last figure must be obtained elsewhere.
It must not be overlooked that the object in taking a
census being to calculate the probable revenue by enumerating
the taxable persons, the margin of error and deficiency depends
on the peace of the state at the time, and not chiefly on
the estimate of five or more to a household.</p>

<p>The amount for 1736 corresponds sufficiently closely with
that for 1743; and reckoning the same number of persons in a
family in 1753, that tallies well enough with those for 1760,
1761, and 1762, the whole showing a gradual increase for
twenty-five years. But all of them, except that of 1753, are
probably rated too high. That for 1762 (No. 17), has been
justly considered as one of the most authentic.</p>

<p>The amount given by “Z.” of Berlin (No. 18), of 155⅓ millions
for 1790 is quoted in the <cite>Chinese Repository</cite>, but the
writer states no authorities, was probably never in China, and
as it appears at present, is undeserving the least notice. That
given by Dr. Morrison for 1792 (No. 19), the year before Lord
Macartney’s embassy, is quoted from an edition of that date,
but probably was really taken in 1765 or thereabouts, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
did not publish it in detail.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> It is probably much nearer the
truth than the amount of 333 millions by the commissioner
Chau to the English ambassador. This estimate has had much
more respect paid to it as an authentic document than it deserved.
The Chinese commissioner would naturally wish to
exalt his country in the eyes of its far-travelled visitors, and
not having the official returns to refer to, would not be likely
to state them less than they were. He gave the population of
the provinces in round numbers, perhaps altogether from his
own memory, aided by those of his attendant clerks, with the
impression that his hearers would never be able to refer to the
original native authorities.</p>

<p>The next one quoted (No. 21) is the most satisfactory of all
the censuses in Chinese works, and was considered by both the
Morrisons and by Dr. Bridgman, editor of the <cite>Chinese Repository</cite>,
as “the most accurate that has yet been given of the
population.”</p>

<p>In questions of this nature, one well authenticated table is
worth a score of doubtful origin. It has been shown how
apocryphal are many of the statements given in foreign books,
but with the census of 1812, the source of error which is chiefly
to be guarded against is the average given to a family. This
is done by the Chinese themselves on no uniform plan, and it
may be the case that the estimate of individuals from the number
of families is made in separate towns, from an intimate
acquaintance with the particular district, which would be less
liable to error than a general average. The number of families
given in the census of 1753, is 37,785,552, which is more than
one-third of the population.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FOUR MOST RELIABLE CENSUSES.</div>

<p>The four censuses which deserve the most credit, so far as
the sources are considered, are those of 1711, 1753, 1792, and
1812 (<i>i.e.</i>, Nos. 8, 13, 19, and 21); these, when compared,
show the following rate of increase:</p>

<p>From 1711 to 1753, the population increased 74,222,602,
which was an annual advance of 1,764,824 inhabitants, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
little more than six per cent. per annum for forty-two years.
This high rate, it must be remembered, does not take into account
the more thorough subjugation of the south and west at
the later date, when the Manchus could safely enrol large districts,
where in 1711 they would have found so much difficulty
that they would not have attempted it.</p>

<p>From 1753 to 1792, the increase was 104,636,882, or an annual
advance of 2,682,997 inhabitants, or about 2&frac12; per cent.
per annum for thirty-nine years. During this period, the
country enjoyed almost uninterrupted peace under the vigorous
sway of Kienlung, and the unsettled regions of the south and
west rapidly filled up.</p>

<p>From 1792 to 1812, the increase was 54,126,679, or an annual
advance of 2,706,333&mdash;not quite one per cent. per annum&mdash;for
twenty years. At the same rate of progress the present
population would amount to over 450,000,000, and this might
have been the case had not the Tai-ping rebellion reduced the
numbers. An enumeration (No. 22), was published by the
Russian Professor of Chinese Vassilivitch in 1868 as a translation
from official documents. Foreigners have had greater
opportunities for travel through the country, between the years
1840 to 1880, and have ascertained the enormous depopulation
in some places caused by wars, short supplies of food in consequence
of scarcity of laborers, famines, or brigandage, each
adding its own power of destruction at different places and
times. The conclusion will not completely satisfy any inquirer,
but the population of the Empire cannot now reasonably
be estimated as high as the census of 1812, by at
least twenty-five millions. The last in the list of these censuses
(No. 23), is added as an example of the efforts of intelligent
persons residing in China to come to a definite and
independent conclusion on this point from such data as they
can obtain. The Imperial Customs’ Service has been able to
command the best native assistance in their researches, and the
table of population given above from the <cite>Gotha Almanac</cite> is
the summary of what has been ascertained. The population
of extra-provincial China is really unknown at present. Manchuria
is put down at twelve millions by one author, and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
or four millions, by another, without any official authority for
either; and all those vast regions in Ílí and Tibet may easily
be set down at from twelve to fifteen millions. To sum up,
one must confess that if the Chinese censuses are worth but
little, compared with those taken in European states, they are
better than the guesses of foreigners who have never been in
the country, or who have travelled only partially in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE IN THEIR FAVOR.</div>

<p>The Chinese are doubtless one of the most conceited nations
on the earth, but with all their vanity, they have never bethought
themselves of rating their population twenty-five or
thirty per cent. higher than they suppose it to be, for the purpose
of exalting themselves in the eyes of foreigners or in their
own. Except in one case none of the estimates were presented
to, or intended to be known by foreigners. The distances in <i>li</i>
between places given in Chinese itineraries correspond very
well with the real distances; the number of districts, towns,
and villages in the departments and provinces, as stated in
their local and general topographical works, agree with the
actual examination, so far as it can be made: why should their
censuses be charged with gross error, when, however much we
may doubt them, we cannot disprove them, and the weight of
evidence derived from actual observation rather confirms them
than otherwise; and while their account of towns, villages,
distances, etc., are unhesitatingly adopted until better can be
obtained? Some discrepancies in the various tables are ascribable
to foreigners, and some of the censuses are incomplete,
or the year cannot be precisely fixed, both of which vitiate the
deductions made from them as to the rate of increase. Some
reasons for believing that the highest population ascribed to
the Chinese Empire is not greater than the country can support,
will first be stated, and the objections against receiving the
censuses then considered.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DENSITY OF POPULATIONS IN EUROPE AND CHINA.</div>

<p>The area of the Eighteen Provinces is rather imperfectly given
at 1,348,870 square miles, and the average population, therefore,
for the whole, in 1812, was 268 persons on every square
mile; that of the nine eastern provinces in and near the Great
Plain, comprising 502,192 square miles, or two-fifths of the
whole, is 458 persons, and the nine southern and western provinces,
constituting the other three-fifths, is 154 to a square mile.
The surface and fertility of the country in these two portions
differ so greatly, as to lead one to look for results like these.
The areas of some European states and their population, are
added to assist in making a comparison with China, and coming
to a clearer idea about their relative density.</p>

</table></div>
<p>All these are regarded as well settled countries, but England
and Bengal are the only ones which exceed that of China, taken
as a whole, while none of them come up to the average of the
eastern provinces. All of them, China included, fall far short,
however, of the average population on a square mile of the
kingdoms of Judah and Israel, in the reigns of Abijah and
Jeroboam, if the 1,200,000 men brought into the field by them
can be taken as a ratio of the whole number of inhabitants; or
if the accounts given by Josephus of the density in his day are
trustworthy. In estimating the capabilities of these European
countries to support a dense population, allowances must be
made for roads, pasture-lands, and parks of noblemen, all of
which afford little or no food.</p>

<p>In England and Wales, there are nearly twenty-nine millions
of acres under cultivation, seventeen millions of which are pasture-lands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and only ten millions devoted to grain and vegetables;
the other two millions consist of fallow-ground, hop-beds,
etc. One author estimates that in England 42 acres in a hundred,
and in Ireland 64, are pastures&mdash;a little more than half of
the whole. There are, then, on the average about two acres of
land for the support of each individual, or rather less than this,
if the land required for the food of horses be subtracted. It
has been calculated that eight men can be fed on the same
amount of land that one horse requires; and that four acres of
pasture-land will furnish no more food for man than one of
ploughed land. The introduction of railroads has superseded
the use of horses to such an extent that it is estimated there are
only 200,000 horses now in England, instead of a million in 1830.
If, therefore, one-half the land appropriated to pasture should
be devoted to grain, and no more horses and dogs raised than a
million of acres could support, England and Wales could easily
maintain a population of more than four hundred to a square
mile, supposing them to be willing to live on what the land and
water can furnish.</p>

<p>The Irish consume a greater proportion of vegetables than
the English, even since the improvement by emigration after
1851; many of these live a beggarly life upon half an acre, and
even less, and seldom taste animal food. The quantity of land
under cultivation in Belgium is about fifteen-seventeenths of
the whole, which gives an average of about two acres to each
person, or the same as in England. In these two countries, the
people consume more meat than in Ireland, and the amount of
land occupied for pasturage is in nearly equal proportions in
Belgium and England. In France, the average of cultivated
land is 1⅔ acre; in Holland, 1⅘ acre to each person.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AREA AND VALUE OF ARABLE LAND IN CHINA.</div>

<p>If the same proportion between the arable and uncultivated
land exists in China as in England, namely one-fourth, there are
about six hundred and fifty millions of acres under cultivation
in China; and we are not left altogether to conjecture, for by a
report made to Kienlung in 1745, it appears that the area of
the land under cultivation was 595,598,221 acres; a subsequent
calculation places it at 640,579,381 acres, which is almost the
same proportion as in England. Estimating it at six hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and fifty millions&mdash;for it has since increased rather than diminished&mdash;it
gives one acre and four-fifths to every person, which
is by no means a small supply for the Chinese, considering that
there are no cultivated pastures or meadows.</p>

<p>In comparing the population of different countries, the
manner of living and the articles of food in use, form such important
elements of the calculation, in ascertaining whether the
country be overstocked or not, that a mere tabular view of the
number of persons on a square mile is an imperfect criterion of
the amount of inhabitants the land would maintain if they consumed
the same food, and lived in the same manner in all of
them. Living as the Chinese, Hindus, Japanese, and other
Asiatics do, chiefly upon vegetables, the country can hardly be
said to maintain more than one-half or one-third as many people
on a square mile as it might do, if their energies were developed
to the same extent with those of the English or Belgians.
The population of these eastern regions has been
repressed by the combined influences of ignorance, insecurity of
life and property, religious prejudices, vice, and wars, so that the
land has never maintained as many inhabitants as one would
have otherwise reasonably expected therefrom.</p>

<p>Nearly all the cultivated soil in China is employed in raising
food for man. Woollen garments and leather are little used,
while cotton and mulberry cultivation take up only a small proportion
of the soil. There is not, so far as is known, a single
acre of land sown with grass-seed, and therefore almost no
human labor is devoted to raising food for animals, which
will not also serve to sustain man. Horses are seldom used for
pomp or war, for travelling or carrying burdens, but mules,
camels, asses, and goats are employed for transportation and
other purposes north of the Yangtsz’ River. Horses are fed on
cooked rice, bran, sorghum seed, pulse, oats, and grass cut along
the banks of streams, or on hillsides. In the southern and
eastern provinces, all animals are rare, the transport of goods
and passengers being done by boats or by men. The natives
make no use of butter, cheese, or milk, and the few cattle employed
in agriculture easily gather a living on the waste ground
around the villages. In the south, the buffalo is applied more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
than the ox to plough the rice fields, and the habits of this
animal make it cheaper to keep him in good condition, while he
can also do more work. The winter stock is grass cut upon the
hills, straw, bean stalks, and vegetables. No wool being wanted
for making cloth, flocks of sheep and goats are seldom seen&mdash;it
may almost be said are unknown in the east and south.</p>

<p>No animal is reared cheaper than the hog; hatching and
raising ducks affords employment to thousands of people; hundreds
of these fowl gather their own food along the river
shore, being easily attended by a single keeper. Geese and
poultry are also cheaply reared. In fishing, which is carried on
to an enormous extent, no pasture-grounds, no manuring, no
barns, are needed, nor are taxes paid by the cultivator and consumer.</p>

<p>While the people get their animal food in these ways, its
preparation takes away the least possible amount of cultivated
soil. The space occupied for roads and pleasure-grounds is insignificant,
but there is perhaps an amount appropriated for
burial places quite equal to the area used for those purposes in
European countries; it is, however, less valuable land, and
much of it would be useless for culture, even if otherwise unoccupied.
Graves are dug on hills, in ravines and copses, and
wherever they will be retired and dry; or if in the ancestral
field, they do not hinder the crop growing close around them.
Moreover, it is very common to preserve the coffin in temples
and cemeteries until it is decayed, partly in order to save the
expense of a grave, and partly to worship the remains, or preserve
them until gathered to their fathers, in their distant
native places. They are often placed in the corners of the fields,
or under precipices where they remain till dust returns to dust,
and bones and wood both moulder away. These and other customs
limit the consumption of land for graves much more than
would be supposed, when one sees, as at Macao, almost as much
space taken up by the dead for a grave as by the living for a
hut. The necropolis of Canton occupies the hills north of the
city, of which not one-fiftieth part could ever have been used
for agriculture, but where cattle are allowed to graze, as much
as if there were no tombs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Under its genial and equable climate, more than three-fourths
of the area of China Proper produces two crops annually. In
Kwangtung, Kwangsí, and Fuhkien, two crops of rice are taken
year after year from the low lands; while in the loess regions
of the northwest, a three-fold return from the grain fields is
annually looked for, if the rain-fall is not withheld. In the
winter season, in the neighborhood of towns, a third crop of
sweet potatoes, cabbages, turnips, or some other vegetable is
grown. De Guignes estimates the returns of a rice crop at ten
for one, which, with the vegetables, will give full twenty-five
fold from an acre in a year; few parts, however, yield this increase.
Little or no land lies fallow, for constant manuring and
turning of the soil prevents the necessity of repose. The diligence
exhibited in collecting and applying manure is well
known, and if all this industry result in the production of two
crops instead of one, it really doubles the area under cultivation,
when its superficies are compared with those of other
countries. If the amount of land which produces two crops be
estimated at one-fourth of the whole (and it is perhaps as near
one-third), the area of arable land in the provinces may be considered
as representing a total of 812 millions of acres, or 2&frac34;
acres to an individual. The land is not, however, cut up into such
small farms as to prevent its being managed as well as the people
know how to stock and cultivate it; manual labor is the chief
dependence of the farmer, fewer cattle, carts, ploughs, and
machines being employed than in other countries. In rice
fields no animals are used after the wet land has received the
shoots, transplanting, weeding, and reaping being done by men.</p>

<p>In no other country besides Japan is so much food derived
from the water. Not only are the coasts, estuaries, rivers, and
lakes, covered with fishing-boats of various sizes, which are provided
with everything fitted for the capture of whatever lives
in the waters, but the spawn of fish is collected and reared.
Rice fields are often converted into pools in the winter season,
and stocked with fish; and the tanks dug for irrigation usually
contain fish. By all these means, an immense supply of food
is obtained at a cheap rate, which is eaten fresh or preserved
with or without salt, and sent over the Empire, at a cost which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
places it within the reach of all above beggary. Other articles
of food, both animal and vegetable, such as dogs, game, worms,
spring greens, tripang, leaves, etc., do indeed compose part of
their meals, but it is comparatively an inconsiderable fraction,
and need not enter into the calculation. Enough has been stated
to show that the land is abundantly able to support the population
ascribed to it, even with all the drawbacks known to exist;
and that, taking the highest estimate to be true, and considering
the mode of living, the average population on a square mile
in China is less than in several European countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TENDENCIES TO INCREASE OF POPULATION.</div>

<p>The political and social causes which tend to multiply the inhabitants
are numerous and powerful. The failure of male
posterity to continue the succession of the family, and worship
at the tombs of parents, is considered by all classes as one of
the most afflictive misfortunes of life; the laws allow unlimited
facilities of adoption, and secure the rights of those taken into
the family in this way. The custom of betrothing children,
and the obligation society imposes upon the youth when arrived
at maturity, to fulfil the contracts entered into by their parents,
acts favorably to the establishment of families and the nurture
of children, and restricts polygamy. Parents desire children
for a support in old age, as there is no legal or benevolent provision
for aged poverty, and public opinion stigmatizes the man
who allows his aged or infirm parents to suffer when he can
help them. The law requires the owners of domestic slaves to
provide husbands for their females, and prohibits the involuntary
or forcible separation of husband and wife, or parents and
children, when the latter are of tender age. All these causes
and influences tend to increase population, and equalize the
consumption and use of property more, perhaps, than in any
other land.</p>

<p>The custom of families remaining together tends to the
same result. The local importance of a large family in the
country is weakened by its male members removing to town, or
emigrating; consequently, the patriarch of three or four generations
endeavors to retain his sons and grandsons around him,
their houses joining his, and they and their families forming a
social, united company. Such cases as those mentioned in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
<cite>Sacred Commands</cite> are of course rare, where nine generations
of the family of Chang Kung-í inhabited one house, or of Chin,
at whose table seven hundred mouths were daily fed,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> but it is
the tendency of society. This remark does not indicate that
great landed proprietors exist, whose hereditary estates are secured
by entail to the great injury of the state, as in Great Britain,
for the farms are generally small and cultivated by the
owner or on the metayer system. Families are supported on a
more economical plan, the claims of kindred are better enforced,
the land is cultivated with more care, and the local importance
of the family perpetuated. This is, however, a very
different system from that advocated by Fourier in France, or
Greeley in America, for these little communities are placed
under one natural head, whose authority is acknowledged and
upheld, and his indignation feared. Workmen of the same
profession form unions, each person contributing a certain sum
on the promise of assistance when sick or disabled, and this
custom prevents and alleviates a vast amount of poverty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESTRICTIONS UPON EMIGRATION.</div>

<p>The obstacles put in the way of emigrating beyond sea, both
in law and prejudice, operate to deter respectable persons from
leaving their native land. Necessity has made the law a dead
letter, and thousands annually leave their homes. No better
evidence of the dense population can be offered to those acquainted
with Chinese feelings and character, than the extent
of emigration. “What stronger proof,” observes Medhurst,
“of the dense population of China could be afforded than the
fact, that emigration is going on in spite of restrictions and disabilities,
from a country where learning and civilization reign,
and where all the dearest interests and prejudices of the emigrants
are found, to lands like Burmah, Siam, Cambodia, Tibet,
Manchuria, and the Indian Archipelago, where comparative
ignorance and barbarity prevail, and where the extremes of
a tropical or frozen region are to be exchanged for a mild
and temperate climate? Added to this consideration, that
not a single female is permitted or ventures to leave the
country, when consequently, all the tender attachments that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
bind heart to heart must be burst asunder, and, perhaps, forever.”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, if they return with wealth enough to live upon,
they are liable to the vexatious extortions of needy relatives,
sharpers, and police, who have a handle for their fleecing whip
in the law against leaving the country;<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> although this clause
has been neutralized by subsequent acts, and is not in force,
the power of public opinion is against going. A case occurred
in 1832, at Canton, where the son of a Chinese living in Calcutta,
who had been sent home by his parent with his mother,
to perform the usual ceremonies in the ancestral hall, was seized
by his uncle as he was about to be married, on the pretext that
his father had unequally divided the paternal inheritance; he
was obliged to pay a thousand dollars to free himself. Soon
after his marriage, a few sharpers laid hold of him and bore
him away in a sedan, as he was walking near his house, but his
cries attracted the police, who carried them all to the magistrates,
where he was liberated&mdash;after being obliged to fee his
deliverers.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Another case occurred in Macao in 1838. A
man had been living several years in Singapore as a merchant,
and when he settled in Macao still kept up an interest in the
trade with that place. Accounts of his great wealth became
rumored abroad, and he was seriously annoyed by relatives.
One night, a number of thieves, dressed like police-runners,
came to his house to search for opium, and their boisterous
manner terrified him to such a degree, that in order to escape
them he jumped from the terrace upon the hard gravelled
court-yard, and broke his leg, of which he shortly afterward
died. A third case is mentioned, where the returned emigrants,
consisting of a man and his wife, who was a Malay, and
two children, were rescued from extortion, when before the
magistrate, by the kindness of his wife and mother, who wished
to see the foreign woman.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Such instances are now unknown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
owing to the increase of emigration; they were, indeed, never
numerically great, on account of the small number of those who
came back.</p>

<p>The anxiety of the government to provide stores of food for
times of scarcity, shows rather its fear of the disastrous results
following a short crop&mdash;such as the gathering of clamorous
crowds of starving poor, the increase of bandits and disorganization
of society&mdash;than any peculiar care of the rulers, or that
these storehouses really supply deficiencies. The evil consequences
resulting from an overgrown population are experienced
in one or another part of the provinces almost every year; and
drought, inundations, locusts, mildew, or other natural causes,
often give rise to insurrections and disturbances. There can
be no doubt, however, that, without adding a single acre to the
area of arable land, these evils would be materially alleviated,
if the intercommunication of traders and their goods, between
distant parts of the country, were more frequent, speedy, and
safe; but this is not likely to be the case until both rulers and
ruled make greater advances in just government, science, obedience,
and regard for each other’s right.</p>

<p>It would be a satisfaction if foreigners could verify any part
of the census. But this is, at present, impossible. They cannot
examine the records in the office of the Board of Revenue,
nor can they ascertain the population in a given district from
the archives in the hands of the local authorities, or the mode
of taking it. Neither can they go through a village or town to
count the number of houses and their inhabitants, and calculate
from actual examination of a few parts what the whole would
be. Wherever foreigners have journeyed, there has appeared
much the same succession of waste land, hilly regions, cultivated
plains, and wooded heights, as in other countries, with an
abundance of people, but not more than the land could support,
if properly tilled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">METHOD OF TAKING THE CENSUS.</div>

<p>The people are grouped into hamlets and villages, under the
control of village elders and officers. In the district of Nanhai,
which forms the western part of the city of Canton, and
the surrounding country for more than a hundred square miles,
there are one hundred and eighty <i>hiang</i> or villages; the popu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>lation
of each <i>hiang</i> varies from two hundred and upwards to
one hundred thousand, but ordinarily ranges between three
hundred and thirty-five hundred. If each of the eighty-eight
districts in the province of Kwangtung contains the same number
of <i>hiang</i>, there will be, including the district towns, 15,928
villages, towns, and cities in all, with an average population of
twelve hundred inhabitants to each. From the top of the hills
on Dane’s Island, at Whampoa, thirty-six towns and villages can
be counted, of which Canton is one; and four of these contain
from twelve to fifteen hundred houses. The whole district of
Hiangshan, in which Macao lies, is also well covered with villages,
though their exact number is not known. The island of
Amoy contains more than fourscore villages and towns, and
this island forms only a part of the district of Tung-ngan. The
banks of the river leading from Amoy up to Changchau fu, are
likewise well peopled. The environs of Ningpo and Shanghai
are closely settled, though that is no more than one always expects
near large cities, where the demand for food in the city
itself causes the vicinity to be well peopled and tilled. In a
notice of an irruption of the sea in 1819, along the coast of
Shantung, it was reported that a hundred and forty villages
were laid under water.</p>

<p>Marco Polo describes the mode followed in the days of Kublai
khan: “It is the custom for every burgess of the city, and
in fact for every description of person in it, to write over his
door his own name, the name of his wife, and those of his children,
his slaves, and all the inmates of his house, and also the
number of animals that he keeps. And if any one dies in the
house, then the name of that person is erased, and if a child
is born its name is added. So in this way the sovereign is able
to know exactly the population of the city. And this is the
practice throughout all Manzi and Cathay.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> This custom was
observed long before the Mongol conquest, and is followed at
present; so that it is perhaps easier to take a census in China
than in most European countries.</p>

<p>The law upon this subject is contained in Secs. LXXV. and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
LXXVI. of the statutes. It enacts various penalties for not
registering the members of a family, and its provisions all go to
show that the people are desirous rather of evading the census
than of exaggerating it. When a family has omitted to make
any entry, the head of it is liable to be punished with one hundred
blows if he is a freeholder, and with eighty if he is not.
If the master of a family has among his household another distinct
family whom he omits to register, the punishment is the
same as in the last clause, with a modification, according as the
unregistered persons and family are relatives or strangers.
Persons in government employ omitting to register their families,
are less severely punished. A master of family failing to
register all the males in his household who are liable to public
service, shall be punished with from sixty to one hundred blows,
according to the demerits of the offence; this clause was in
effect repealed, when the land tax was substituted for the capitation
tax. Omissions, from neglect or inadvertency to register
all the individuals and families in a village or town, on the part
of the headmen or government clerks, are punishable with
different degrees of severity. All persons whatsoever are to
be registered according to their accustomed occupations or professions,
whether civil or military, whether couriers, artisans,
physicians, astrologers, laborers, musicians, or of any other denomination
whatever; and subterfuges in representing one’s self
as belonging to a profession not liable to public service, are
visited as usual with the bamboo; persons falsely describing
themselves as belonging to the army, in order to evade public
service, are banished as well as beaten.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> From these clauses it
is seen that the Manchus have extended the enumeration to
classes which were exempted in the Han, Tang, and other
dynasties, and thus come nearer to the actual population.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS PROBABLE ACCURACY.</div>

<p>“In the Chinese government,” observes Dr. Morrison, “there
appears great regularity and system. Every district has its
appropriate officers, every street its constable, and every ten
houses their tything man. Thus they have all the requisite
means of ascertaining the population with considerable accu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>racy.
Every family is required to have a board always hanging
up in the house, and ready for the inspection of authorized officers,
on which the names of all persons, men, women, and children,
in the house are inscribed. This board is called <i>mun-pai</i>
or ‘door-tablet,’ because when there are women and children
within, the officers are expected to take the account from the
board at the door. Were all the inmates of a family faithfully
inserted, the amount of the population would, of course, be
ascertained with great accuracy. But it is said that names are
sometimes omitted through neglect or design; others think
that the account of persons given in is generally correct.”
The door-tablets are sometimes pasted on the door, thus serving
as a kind of door-plate; in these cases correctness of enumeration
is readily secured, for the neighbors are likely to know
if the record is below the truth, and the householder is not
likely to exaggerate the taxable inmates under his roof. I have
read these <i>mun-pai</i> on the doors of a long row of houses; they
were printed blanks filled in, and then pasted outside for the <i>pao-kiah</i>
or tithing man to examine. Both Dr. Morrison and his
son, than whom no one has had better opportunities to know the
true state of the case, or been more desirous of dealing fairly
with the Chinese, regarded the censuses given in the <cite>General
Statistics</cite> as more trustworthy than any other documents
available.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EVIDENCES IN FAVOR OF THE CENSUS.</div>

<p>In conclusion, it may be asked, are the results of the enumeration
of the people, as contained in the statistical works published
by the government, to be rejected or doubted, therefore,
because the Chinese officers do not wish to ascertain the exact
population; or because they are not capable of doing it; or,
lastly, because they wish to impose upon foreign powers by an
arithmetical array of millions they do not possess? The question
seems to hang upon this trilemma. It is acknowledged
that they falsify or garble statements in a manner calculated to
throw doubt upon everything they write, as in the reports of
victories and battles sent to the Emperor, in the memorials upon
the opium trade, in their descriptions of natural objects in
books of medicine, and in many other things. But the question
is as applicable to China as to France: is the estimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
population of France in 1801 to be called in question, because
the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moniteur</cite> gave false accounts of Napoleon’s battles in 1813?
It would be a strange combination of conceit and folly, for a
ministry composed of men able to carry on all the details of a
complicated government like that of China, to systematically
exaggerate the population, and then proceed, for more than a
century, with taxation, disbursements, and official appointments,
founded upon these censuses. Somebody at least must know
them to be worthless, and the proof that they were so, must,
one would think, ere long be apparent. The provinces and
departments have been divided and subdivided since the Jesuits
made their survey, because they were becoming too densely
settled for the same officers to rule over them.</p>

<p>Still less will any one assert that the Chinese are not capable
of taking as accurate a census as they are of measuring distances,
or laying out districts and townships. Errors may be
found in the former as well as in the latter, and doubtless are
so; for it is not contended that the four censuses of 1711, 1753,
1792, and 1812 are as accurate as those now taken in England,
France, or the United States, but that they are the best data
extant, and that if they are rejected we leave tolerable evidence
and take up with that which is doubtful and suppositive. The
censuses taken in China since the Christian era are, on the
whole, more satisfactory than those of all other nations put
together up to the Reformation, and further careful research
will no doubt increase our respect for them.</p>

<p>Ere long we may be able to traverse a census in its details of
record and deduction, and thus satisfy a reasonable curiosity,
especially as to the last reported total after the carnage of the
rebellion. On the other hand, it may be stated that in the last
census, the entire population of Manchuria, Koko-nor, Ílí, and
Mongolia, is estimated at only 2,167,286 persons, and nearly all
the inhabitants of those vast regions are subject to the Emperor.
The population of Tibet is not included in any census,
its people not being taxable. It is doubtful if an enumeration
of any part of the extra provincial territory has ever been
taken, inasmuch as the Mongol tribes, and still less the Usbeck
or other Moslem races, are unused to such a thing, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
not be numbered. Yet, the Chinese cannot be charged with
exaggeration, when good judges, as Klaproth and others, reckon
the whole at between six and seven millions; and Khoten alone,
one author states, has three and a half millions. No writer of
importance estimates the inhabitants of these regions as high
as thirty millions&mdash;as does R. Mont. Martin&mdash;which would be
more than ten to a square mile, excluding Gobi; while Siberia
(though not so well peopled) has only 3,611,300 persons on an
area of 2,649,600 square miles, or 1⅓ to each square mile.</p>

<p>The reasons just given why the Chinese desire posterity are
not all those which have favored national increase. The uninterrupted
peace which the country enjoyed between the years
1700 and 1850 operated to greatly develop its resources. Every
encouragement has been given to all classes to multiply and
fill the land. Polygamy, slavery, and prostitution, three social
evils which check increase, have been circumscribed in their
effects. Early betrothment and poverty do much to prevent
the first; female slaves can be and are usually married; while
public prostitution is reduced by a separation of the sexes and
early marriages. No fears of overpassing the supply of food
restrain the people from rearing families, though the Emperor
Kienlung issued a proclamation in 1793, calling upon all ranks
of his subjects to economize the gifts of heaven, lest, erelong,
the people exceed the means of subsistence.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see what this or that reason or objection has
to do with the subject, except where the laws of population are
set at defiance, which is not the case in China. Food and work,
peace and security, climate and fertile soil, not universities or
steamboats, are the encouragements needed for the multiplication
of mankind; though they do not have that effect in all
countries (as in Mexico and Brazil), it is no reason why they
should not in others. There are grounds for believing that not
more than two-thirds of the whole population of China were
included in the census of 1711, but that allowance cannot be
made for Ireland in 1785; and consequently, her annual percentage
of increase, up to 1841, would then be greater than
China, during the forty-two years ending with 1753. McCulloch
quotes De Guignes approvingly, but the Frenchman takes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
rough estimate of 333,000,000 given to Macartney, which is less
trustworthy than that of 307,467,200, and compares it with
Grosier’s of 157,343,975, which is certainly wrong through his
misinterpretation. De Guignes proceeds from the data in his
possession in 1802 (which were less than those now available),
and from his own observations in travelling through the country
in 1796, to show the improbability of the estimated population.
But the observations made in journeys, taken as were
those of the English and Dutch embassies, though they passed
through some of the best provinces, cannot be regarded as good
evidence against official statistics.</p>

<p>Would any one suppose, in travelling from Boston to Chatham,
and then from Albany to Buffalo, along the railroad, that
Massachusetts contained, in 1870, exactly double the population
on a square mile of New York? So, in going from Peking to
Canton, the judgment which six intelligent travellers might
form of the population of China could easily be found to differ
by one-half. De Guignes says, after comparing China with
Holland and France, “All these reasons clearly demonstrate
that the population of China does not exceed that of other
countries;” and such is in truth the case, if the kind of food,
number of crops, and materials of dress be taken into account.
His remarks on the population and productiveness of the country
are, like his whole work, replete with good sense and candor;
but some of his deductions would have been different, had he
been in possession of all the data since obtained.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The discrepancies
between the different censuses have been usually considered
a strong internal evidence against them, and they should receive
due consideration. The really difficult point is to fix the
percentage that must be allowed for the classes not included as
taxable, and the power of the government to enumerate those
who wished to avoid a census and the subsequent taxation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POSSIBILITIES OF ERROR.</div>

<p>After all these reasons for receiving the total of 1812 as the
best one, there are, on the other hand, two principal objections
against taking the Chinese census as altogether trustworthy.
The first is the enormous averages of 850, 705, and 671 inhab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>itants
on a square mile, severally apportioned to Kiangsu, Nganhwui,
and Chehkiang, or, what is perhaps a fairer calculation,
of 458 persons to the nine eastern provinces. Whatever amount
of circumstantial evidence may be brought forward in confirmation
of the census as a whole, and explanation of the mode of
taking it, a more positive proof seems to be necessary before
giving implicit credence to this result. Such a population on
such an extensive area is marvellous, notwithstanding the
fertility of the soil, facilities of navigation, and salubrity of the
climate of these regions, although acknowledged to be almost
unequalled. While we admit the full force of all that has been
urged in support of the census, and are willing to take it as the
best document on the subject extant, it is desirable to have
proofs derived from personal observation, and to defer the settlement
of this question until better opportunities are afforded.
So high an average is, indeed, not without example. Captain
Wilkes ascertained, in 1840, that one of the islands of the Fiji
group supported a population of over a thousand on a square
mile. On Lord North’s Island, in the Pelew group, the crew
of the American whaler Mentor ascertained there were four
hundred inhabitants living on half a square mile. These, and
many other islands in that genial clime, contain a population
far exceeding that of any large country, and each separate community
is obliged to depend wholly on its own labor. They
cannot, however, be cited as altogether parallel cases, though if
it be true, as Barrow says, “that an acre of cotton will clothe
two or three hundred persons,” not much more land need be
occupied with cotton or mulberry plants, for clothing in China,
than in the South Sea Islands.</p>

<p>The second objection against receiving the result of the census
is, that we are not well informed as to the mode of enumerating
the people by families, and the manner of taking the account,
when the patriarch of two or three generations lives in
a hamlet, with all his children and domestics around him. Two
of the provisions in Sec. XXV. of the <cite>Code</cite>, seem to be designed
for some such state of society; and the liability to underrate
the males fit for public service, when a capitation tax was
ordered, and to overrate the inmates of such a house, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
head of it might suppose he would thereby receive increased aid
from government when calamity overtook him, are equally apparent.
The door-tablet is also liable to mistake, and in shops
and workhouses, where the clerks and workmen live and sleep
on the premises, it is not known what kind of report of families
the assessors make. On these important points our present information
is imperfect, while the evident liability to serious
error in the ultimate results makes one hesitate. The Chinese
may have taken a census satisfactory for their purposes, showing
the number of families, and the average in each; but the point
of this objection is, that we do not know how the families are
enumerated, and therefore are at fault in reckoning the individuals.
The average of persons in a household is set down at five
by the Chinese, and in England, in 1831, it was 4.7, but it is
probably less than that in a thickly settled country, if every
married couple and their children be taken as a family, whether
living by themselves, or grouped in patriarchal hamlets.</p>

<p>No one doubts that the population is enormous, constituting
by far the greatest assemblage of human beings using one speech
ever congregated under one monarch. To the merchants and
manufacturers of the West, the determination of this question
is of some importance, and through them to their governments.
The political economist and philologist, the naturalist and geographer,
have also greater or less degrees of interest in the
contemplation of such a people, inhabiting so beautiful and fertile
a country. But the Christian philanthropist turns to the
consideration of this subject with the liveliest solicitude; for if
the weight of evidence is in favor of the highest estimate, he
feels his responsibility increase to a painful degree. The danger
to this people is furthermore greatly enhanced by the opium
traffic&mdash;a trade which, as if the Rivers Phlegethon and Lethe
were united in it, carries fire and destruction wherever it flows,
and leaves a deadly forgetfulness wherever it has passed. Let
these facts appeal to all calling themselves Christians, to send
the antidote to this baleful drug, and diffuse a knowledge of the
principles of the Gospel among them, thereby placing life as
well as death before them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REVENUE OF THE EMPIRE.</div>

<p>If the population of the Empire is not easily ascertained, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
satisfactory account of the public revenue and expenditures is
still more difficult to obtain; it possesses far less interest, of
course, in itself, and in such a country as China is subject to
many variations. The market value of the grain, silk, and
other products in which a large proportion of the taxes are paid,
varies from year to year; and although this does not materially
affect the government which receives these articles, it complicates
the subject very much when attempting to ascertain the
real taxation. Statistics on these subjects are only of recent
date in Europe, and should not yet be looked for in China,
drawn up with much regard to truth. The central government
requires each province to support itself, and furnish a certain
surplusage for the maintenance of the Emperor and his court;
but it is well known that his Majesty is continually embarrassed
for the want of funds, and that the provinces do not all supply
enough revenue to meet their own outlays.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOURCES AND AMOUNT OF REVENUE.</div>

<p>The amounts given by various authors as the revenue of
China at different times, are so discordant, that a single glance
shows that they were obtained from partial or incomplete returns,
or else refer only to the surplusage sent to the capital.
De Guignes remarks very truly, that the Chinese are so fully
persuaded of the riches, power, and resources of their country,
that a foreigner is likely to receive different accounts from every
native he asks; but there appears to be no good reason why the
government should falsify or abridge their fiscal accounts. In
1587, Trigault, one of the French missionaries, stated the revenue
at only tls. 20,000,000. In 1655, Nieuhoff reckoned it at
tls. 108,000,000. About twelve years after, Magalhaens gave
the treasures of the Emperor at $20,423,962; and Le Comte,
about the same time, placed the revenue at $22,000,000, and
both of them estimated the receipts from rice, silk, etc, at
$30,000,000, making the whole revenue previous to Kanghí’s
death, in 1721, between fifty and seventy millions of dollars.
Barrow reckoned the receipts from all sources in 1796 at
tls. 198,000,000, derived from a rough estimate given by the
commissioner who accompanied the embassy. Sir George
Staunton places the total sum at $330,000,000; of which
$60,000,000 only were transmitted to Peking. Medhurst,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
drawing his information from original sources, thus states the

<p>This is evidently only the sum sent to the capital from this
province, ostensibly as the revenue, and which the provincial
treasury must collect. The real receipts from this province or
any other cannot well be ascertained by foreigners; it is, however,
known, that in former years, the collector of customs at
Canton was obliged to remit annually from eight hundred
thousand to one million three hundred thousand taels, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the gross receipts of his office were not far from three millions
of taels.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> This was then the richest collectorate in the
Empire; but since the foreign trade at the open ports has been
placed under foreign supervision, the resources of the Empire
have been better reported. A recent analysis of the sources of
revenue in the Eighteen Provinces has been furnished by the
customs service; it places them under different headings from
the preceding list, though the total does not materially differ.
Out of this whole amount the sum derived from the trade in
foreign shipping goes most directly to the central exchequer.</p>

<p>De Guignes has examined the subject of the revenue with

<p>The difference of about eighty millions of dollars between
this amount and that given by Medhurst, will not surprise one
who has looked into this perplexing matter. All these calculations
are based on approximations, which, although easily made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
up, cannot be verified to our satisfaction; but all agree in placing
the total amount of revenue below that of any European
government in proportion to the population. In 1823, a paper
was published by a graduate upon the fiscal condition of the
country, in which he gave a careful analysis of the receipts and
disbursements. P. P. Thoms translated it in detail, and summarized
the former under three heads of taxes reckoned at
tls. 33,327,056, rice sent to Peking 6,346,438, and supplies to
army 7,227,360&mdash;in all tls. 46,900,854. Out of the first sum
tls. 24,507,933 went to civilians and the army, leaving tls. 5,819,123
for the Peking government, and tls. 3,000,000 for the Yellow
River repairs and Yuen-ming Palace. The resources of the
Empire this writer foots up at tls. 74,461,633, or just one-half
of what Medhurst gives. The extraordinary sources of revenue
which are resorted to in time of war or bad harvests, are sale of
office and honors, temporary increase of duties, and demands
for contributions from wealthy merchants and landholders. The
first is the most fruitful source, and may be regarded rather as
a permanent than a temporary expediency employed to make
up deficiencies. The mines of gold and silver, pearl fisheries in
Manchuria and elsewhere, precious stones brought from Ílí and
Khoten, and other localities, furnish several millions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCIPAL ITEMS OF EXPENDITURE.</div>

<p>The expenditures, almost every year, exceed the revenue, but
how the deficit is supplied does not clearly appear; it has been
sometimes drawn from the rich by force, at other times made
good by paltering with the currency, as in 1852-55, and again
by reducing rations and salaries. In 1832, the Emperor said
the excess of disbursements was tls. 28,000,000;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and, in 1836,
the defalcation was still greater, and offices and titles to the
amount of tls. 10,000,000 were put up for sale to supply it.
This deficiency has become more and more alarming since the
drain of specie annually sent abroad in payment for opium
has been increased by military exactions for suppressing the
rebellion up to 1867. At that date the Empire began to recuperate.
The principal items of the expenditure are thus stated
by De Guignes:</p>

<p>This, according to his calculation, shows a surplus of nearly
twenty millions of taels every year. But the outlays for quelling
insurrections and transporting troops, deficiency from bad
harvests, defalcation of officers, payments to the tribes and
princes in Mongolia and Ílí, and other unusual demands, more
than exceed this surplus. In 1833, the <cite>Peking Gazette</cite> contained
an elaborate paper on the revenue, proposing various
ways and means for increasing it. The author, named Na, says
the income from land tax, the gabel, customs and transit duty,
does not in all exceed forty millions of taels, while the expenditures
should not much transcend thirty in years of peace.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> This
places the budget much lower than other authorities, but the
censor perhaps includes only the imperial resources, though the
estimate would then be too high. The pay and equipment of
the troops is the largest item of expenditure, and it is probable
that here the apparent force and pay are far too great, and that
reductions are constantly made in this department by compelling
the soldiers to depend more and more for support upon
the plats of land belonging to them. It is considered the best
evidence of good government on the part of an officer to render
his account of the revenue satisfactorily, but from the injudicious
system which exists of combining fiscal, legislative, and
judicial functions and control in the same person, the temptations
to defraud are strong, and the peculations proportionably
great.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OFFICERS’ SALARIES AND THE LAND-TAX.</div>

<p>The salaries of officers, for some reasons, are placed so low as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
to prove that the legal allowances were really the nominal incomes,
and the sums set against their names in the <cite>Red Book</cite>
as <i>yang tien</i>, or anti-extortion perquisites (lit., ‘nourishing
frugality’), are the salaries. That of a governor-general is
from 15,000 to 25,000 taels for the latter, and only 180 or 200
taels for the legal salary; a governor gets 15,000 when he is
alone, and 10,000 or 12,000 when under a governor-general; a
treasurer from 4,500 to 10,000; a judge from 3,000 to 8,000;
a prefect from 2,000 to 4,500; district magistrates from 700 to
1,000, according to the onerousness of the post; an intendant
from 3,000 to 4,500; a literary chancellor from 2,000 to 5,000;
and military men from 4,000 taels down to 100 or 150 per
annum. The perquisites of the highest and lowest officers are
disproportionate, for the people prefer to lay their important
cases before the highest courts at once, in order to avoid the
expense of passing through those of a lower grade. The personal
disposition of the functionary modifies the exactions he
makes upon the people so much, that no guess can be made as
to the amount.</p>

<p>The land tax is the principal resource for the revenue in
rural districts, and this is well understood by all parties, so that
there is less room for exactions. The land tax is from 1&frac12; to 10
cents a <i>mao</i> (or from 10 to 66 cents an acre), according to the
quality of the land, and difficulty of tillage; taking the average
at 25 cents an acre, the income from this source would be upward
of 150 millions of dollars. The clerks, constables, lictors,
and underlings of the courts and prisons, are the “claws” of
their superiors, as the Chinese aptly call them, and perform
most of their extortions, and are correspondingly odious to the
people. In towns and trading places, it is easier for the officers
to exact in various ways from wealthy people, than in the country,
where rich people often hire bodies of retainers to defy the
police, and practise extortion and robbery themselves. Like
other Asiatic governments, China suffers from the consequences
of bribery, peculation, extortion, and poorly paid officers, but
she has no powerful aristocracy to retain the money thus squeezed
out of the people, and ere long it finds its way out of the hands
of emperors and ministers back into the mass of the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
The Chinese believe, however, that the Emperor annually remits
such amounts as he is able to collect into Mukden, in time
of extremity; but latterly he has not been able to do so at all,
and probably never sent as much to that city as the popular
ideas imagine. The sum applied to filling the granaries is
much larger, but this popular provision in case of need is really
a light draft upon the resources of the country, as it is usually
managed. In Canton, there are only fourteen buildings appropriated
to this purpose, few of them more than thirty feet
square, and none of them full.</p>

<span class="smaller">NATURAL HISTORY OF CHINA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The succinct account of the natural history of China given
by Sir John Davis in 1836, contained nearly all the popular
notices of much value then known, and need not be repeated,
while summarizing the items derived from other and later
sources. Malte-Brun observed long ago, “That of even the
more general, and, according to the usual estimate, the more
important features of that vast sovereignty, we owe whatever
knowledge we have obtained to some ambassadors who have
seen the courts and the great roads&mdash;to certain merchants who
have inhabited a suburb of a frontier town&mdash;and to several
missionaries who, generally more credulous than discriminating,
have contrived to penetrate in various directions into the interior.”
The volumes upon China in the Edinburgh Cabinet
Library contain the best digest of what was known forty years
since on this subject. The botanical collections of Robert Fortune
in 1844-1849, and those of Col. Champion at Hongkong,
have been studied by Bentham, while the later researches of
Hance, Bunge and Maximowitch have brought many new forms
to notice. In geology, Pumpelly, Kingsmill, Bickmore, and
Baron Richthofen have greatly enlarged and certified our
knowledge by their travels and memoirs; while Père David,
Col. Prejevalsky, Swinhoe, Stimpson, and Sir John Richardson
have added hundreds of new species to the scientific fauna of
the Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS.</div>

<p>Personal investigation is particularly necessary in all that relates
to the geology and fossils of a country, and the knowledge
possessed on these heads is, it must be conceded, still meagre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
though now sufficient to convey a general idea of the formations,
deposits, and contents of the mountains and mines, as well as the
agencies at work in modifying the surface of this land. The
descriptions and observed facts recorded in native books may
furnish valuable hints when they can be compared with the
places and productions, for at present the difficulty of explaining
terms used, and understanding the processes described,
render these treatises hard to translate. The empirical character
of Chinese science compels a careful sifting of all its facts
and speculations by comparisons with nature, while the amount
of real information contained in medical, topographical, and
itinerant works render them always worth examining. Large
regions still await careful examination in every part of the
Empire; and it will be well for the Chinese Government if no
tempting metallic deposits are found to test its strength to
protect and work them for its own benefit. But in mere science
it cannot be doubted that so peculiar a part of the world
as the plateau of Central Asia will, when thoroughly examined,
solve many problems relating to geology, and disclose many
important facts to illustrate the obscure phenomena of other
parts of the world.</p>

<p>A few notices of geological formations furnished in the writings
of travellers, have already been given in the geographical
account of the provinces. The summary published by Davis is
a well digested survey of the observations collected by the gentlemen
attached to the embassies.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LOESS-BEDS OF NORTHERN CHINA.</div>

<p>The loess-beds, covering a great portion of Northern China,
are among the most peculiar natural phenomena and interesting
fields for geological investigation on the world’s surface. Since
attention was first directed to this deposit by Pumpelly, in 1864,
its formation and extent have been more carefully examined by
other geologists, whose hypotheses are now pretty generally
discarded for that of Baron von Richthofen. The loess territory
begins, at its eastern limit, with the foot hills of the great
alluvial plane. From this rises a terrace of from 90 to 250 feet
in height, consisting entirely of loess, and westward of it, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
a nearly north and south line, stretches the Tai-hang shan,
or dividing range between the alluvial land and the hill country
of Shansí. An almost uninterrupted loess-covered country extends
west of this line to the Koko-nor and head-waters of the
Yellow River. On the north the formation can be traced from
the vicinity of Kalgan, along the water-shed of the Mongolian
steppes, and into the desert beyond the Ala shan. Toward
the south its limits are less sharply defined; though covering
all the country of the Wei basin (in Shensí), none is found in
Sz’chuen, due south of this valley, but it appears in parts of
Honan and Eastern Shantung. Excepting occasional spurs and
isolated spots&mdash;as at Nanking and the Lakes Poyang and Tungting&mdash;loess
may be considered as ending everywhere on the
north side of the Yangtsz’ valley, and, roughly speaking, to
cover the parallelogram between longs. 99° and 115°, and lats.
33° and 41°. The district within China Proper represents a
territory half as large again as that of the German Empire,
while outside of the Provinces there is reason to believe that
loess spreads far toward the east and north. In the Wu-tai
shan (Shansí), Richthofen observed this deposit to a height of
7,200 feet above the sea, and supposes that it may occur at
higher levels.</p>

<p>The term <i>loess</i>, now generally accepted, has been used to
designate a tertiary deposit appearing in the Rhine valley and
several isolated sections of Europe; its formation has heretofore
been ascribed to glaciers, but its enormous extent and thickness
in China demand some other origin. The substance is a
brownish colored earth, extremely porous, and when dry easily
powdered between the fingers, when it becomes an impalpable
dust that may be rubbed into the pores of the skin. Its particles
are somewhat angular in shape, the lumps varying from
the size of a peanut to a foot in length, whose appearance warrants
the peculiarly appropriate Chinese name meaning ‘ginger
stones.’ After washing, the stuff is readily disintegrated, and
spread far and wide by rivers during their freshets; Kingsmill<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
states that a number of specimens which crumbled in the moist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
air of a Shanghai summer, rearranged themselves afterward in
the bottom of a drawer in which they had been placed. Every
atom of loess is perforated by small tubes, usually very minute,
circulating after the manner of root-fibres, and lined with a thin
coating of carbonate of lime. The direction of these little
canals being always from above downward, cleavage in the loess
mass, irrespective of its size, is invariably vertical, while from
the same cause surface water never collects in the form of rain
puddles or lakes, but sinks at once to the local water level.</p>

<p>One of the most striking, as well as important phenomena of
this formation is the perpendicular splitting of its mass into
sudden and multitudinous clefts that cut up the country in every
direction, and render observation, as well as travel, often exceedingly
difficult. The cliffs, caused by erosion, vary from
cracks measured by inches to cañons half a mile wide and hundreds
of feet deep; they branch out in every direction, ramifying
through the country after the manner of tree-roots in the
soil&mdash;from each root a rootlet, and from these other small
fibres&mdash;until the system of passages develops into a labyrinth of
far-reaching and intermingling lanes. Were the loess throughout
of the uniform structure seen in single clefts, such a region
would indeed be absolutely impassable, the vertical banks
becoming precipices of often more than a thousand feet. The
fact, however, that loess exhibits all over a terrace formation,
renders its surface not only habitable, but highly convenient
for agricultural purposes; it has given rise, moreover, to the
theory advanced by Kingsmill and some others, of its stratification,
and from this a proof of its origin as a marine deposit.
Richthofen argues that these apparent layers of loess are due
to external conditions, as of rocks and débris sliding from surrounding
hillsides upon the loess as it sifted into the basin or
valley, thus interrupting the homogeneity of the gradually rising
deposit. In the sides of gorges near the mountains are seen
layers of coarse débris which, in going toward the valley, become
finer, while the layers themselves are thinner and separated
by an increasing vertical distance; along these rubble
beds are numerous calcareous concretions which stand upright.
These are then the terrace-forming layers which, by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
resistance to the action of water, cause the broken chasms and
step-like contour of the loess regions. Each bank does indeed
cleave vertically, sometimes&mdash;since the erosion works from below&mdash;leaving
an overhanging bank; but meeting with this
horizontal layer of marl stones, the abrasion is interrupted, and
a ledge is made. Falling clods upon such spaces are gradually
spread over their surfaces by natural action, converting them
into rich fields. When seen from a height in good seasons,
these systems of terraces present an endless succession of green
fields and growing crops; viewed from the deep cut of a road
below, the traveller sees nothing but yellow walls of loam and
dusty tiers of loess ridges. As may be readily imagined, a
country of this nature exhibits many landscapes of unrivalled
picturesqueness, especially when lofty crags, which some variation
in the water-course has left as giant guardsmen in fertile
river valleys, stand out in bold relief against the green background
of neighboring hills and a fruitful alluvial bottom, or
when an opening of some ascending pass allows the eye to range
over leagues of sharp-cut ridges and teaming crops, the work of
the careful cultivator.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UTILITY AND FRUITFULNESS OF THE LOESS.</div>

<p>The extreme ease with which loess is cut away tends at times
to seriously embarrass traffic. Dust made by the cart-wheels
on a highway is taken up by strong winds during the dry season
and blown over the surrounding lands, much after the manner
in which it was originally deposited here. This action continued
over centuries, and assisted by occasional deluges of rain, which
find a ready channel in the road-bed, has hollowed the country
routes into depressions of often 50 or 100 feet, where the passenger
may ride for miles without obtaining a glimpse of the
surrounding scenery. Lieutenant Kreitner, of the Széchenyí
exploring expedition, illustrates,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> in a personal experience in
Shansí, the difficulty and danger of leaving these deep cuts;
after scrambling for miles along the broken loess above the
road, he only regained it when a further passage was cut off by
a precipice on the one side, while a jump of some 30 feet into
the beaten track below awaited him on the other. Difficult as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
may be such a territory for roads and the purposes of trade, the
advantages to a farmer are manifold. Wherever this deposit
extends, there the husbandman has an assured harvest, two and
even three times in a year. It is easily worked, exceedingly
fertile, and submits to constant tillage, with no other manure
than a sprinkling of its own loam dug from the nearest bank.
But loess performs still another service to its inhabitants. Caves
made at the base of its straight clefts afford homes to millions
of people in the northern provinces. Choosing an escarpment
where the consistency of the earth is greatest, the natives cut
for themselves rooms and houses, whose partition walls, cement,
bed and furniture are made from the same loess. Whole villages
cluster together in a series of adjoining or superimposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
chambers, some of which pierce the soil to a depth of often
more than 200 feet. In more costly dwellings the terrace or
succession of terraces thus perforated are faced with brick, as
well as the arching of rooms within. The advantages of such
habitations consist as well in imperviousness to changes of temperature
without, as in their durability when constructed in
properly selected places, many loess dwellings outlasting six or
seven generations. The capabilities of defence in a country
such as this, where an invading army must inevitably become
lost in the tangle of interlacing ways, and where the defenders
may always remain concealed, is very suggestive.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Facade of Dwelling in Loess Cliffs, Ling-shí hien. (From Richthofen.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>There remains, lastly, a peculiar property of loess which is
perhaps more important than all other features when measured
by its man-serving efficiency. This is the manner in which it
brings forth crops without the aid of manure. From a period
more than 2,000 years before Christ, to the present day, the
province of Shansí has borne the name of Grainery of the Empire,
while its fertile soil, <i>hwang-tu</i>, or ‘yellow earth,’ is the
origin of the imperial color. Spite of this productiveness,
which, in the fourteenth century, caused the Friar Odoric to
class it as the second country in the world, its present capacity
for raising crops seems to be as great as ever. In the nature of
this substance lies the reason for this apparently inexhaustible
fecundity. Its remarkably porous structure must indeed cause
it to absorb the gases necessary to plant life to a much greater
degree than other soils, but the stable production of those mineral
substances needful to the yearly succession of crops is in
the ground itself. The salts contained more or less in solution
at the water level of the region are freed by the capillary action
of the loess when rain-water sinks through the spongy mass
from above. Surface moisture following the downward direction
of the tiny loess tubes establishes a connection with the
waters compressed below, when, owing to the law of diffusion,
the ingredients, being released, mix with the moisture of the
little canals, and are taken from the lowest to the topmost
levels, permeating the ground and furnishing nourishment to
the plant roots at the surface. It is on account of this curious
action of loess that a copious rain-fall is more necessary in North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
China than elsewhere, for with a dearth of rain the capillary
communication from above, below, and <i>vice versa</i>, is interrupted,
and vegetation loses both its manure and moisture. Drought
and famine are consequently synonymous terms here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RICHTHOFEN’S THEORY OF ITS ORIGIN.</div>

<p>As to the formation and origin of loess, Richthofen’s theory
is substantially as follows:<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The uniform composition of this
material over extended areas, coupled with the absence of
stratification and of marine or fresh-water organic remains,
renders impossible the hypothesis that it is a water deposit.
On the other hand, it contains vast quantities of land-shells and
the vestiges of animals (mammalia) at every level, both in remarkably
perfect condition. Concluding, also, that from the
conformation of the neighboring mountain chains and their
peculiar weathering, the glacial theory is inadmissible, he advances
the supposition that loess is a sub-aërial deposit, and that
its fields are the drained analogues of the steppe-basins of Central
Asia. They date from a geological era of great dryness,
before the existence of the Yellow and other rivers of the northern
provinces. As the rocks and hills of the highlands disintegrated,
the sand was removed, not by water-courses seaward,
but by the high winds ranging over a treeless desert landward,
until the dust settled in the grass-covered districts of what is at
present China Proper. New vegetation was at once nourished,
while its roots were raised by the constantly arriving deposit;
the decay of old roots produced the lime-lined canals which
impart to this material its peculiar characteristics. Any one
who has observed the terrible dust-storms of North China,
when the air is filled with an impalpable yellow powder, which
leaves its coating upon everything, and often extends, in a fog-like
cloud, hundreds of miles to sea, will understand the power
of this action during many thousand years. This deposition received
the shells and bones of innumerable animals, while the dissolved
solutions contained in its bulk stayed therein, or saturated
the water of small lakes. By the sinking of mountain chains
in the south, rain-clouds emptied themselves over this region
with much greater frequency, and gradually the system became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
drained, the erosion working backward from the coast, slowly
cutting into one basin after another. With the sinking of its
salts to lower levels, unexampled richness was added to the
wonderful topography of this peculiar formation.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Pumpelly, while accepting this ingenious theory in place of
his own (that of a fresh-water lake deposit), adds that the supply
of loess might have been materially increased by the vast <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mers-de-glace</i>
of High Asia and the Tien shan, whose streams have
for ages transported the products of glacial attrition into Central
Asia and Northwest China. Again, he insists that Richthofen
has not given importance enough to the parting planes,
wrongly considered by his predecessors as planes of stratification.
“These,” he says, “account for the marginal layers of débris
brought down from the mountains. And the continuous and
more abundant growth of grasses <em>at one plane</em> would produce a
modification of the soil structurally and chemically, which
superincumbent accumulations could never efface. It should
seem probable that we have herein, also, the explanation of the
calcareous concretions which abound along these planes; for the
greater amount of carbonic acid generated by the slow decay of
this vegetation would, by forming a bicarbonate, give to the
lime the mobility necessary to produce the concretions.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">METHODS OF WORKING COAL.</div>

<p>The metallic and mineral productions used in the arts comprise
nearly everything found in other countries, and the common
ones are furnished in such abundance, and at such rates, as
conclusively prove them to be plenty and easily worked. The
careful digest of observations published by Pumpelly through
the Smithsonian Institution, carries out this remark, and indicates
the vast field still to be explored. Coal exists in every
province in China, and Pumpelly enumerates seventy-four localities
which have been ascertained. Marco Polo’s well-known
notice of its use shows that the people had long employed it:
“It is a fact that all over the country of Cathay there is a kind
of black stone existing in beds in the mountains, which they dig
out and burn like firewood. It is true that they have plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
wood also, but they do not burn it, because those stones burn
better and cost less.”<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> This mineral seems to have been unknown
in Europe till after the return of the Venetian to his native
land, while it was employed before the Christian era in China,
and probably in very ancient times, if the accessible deposits in
Shensí then cropped out in its eroded gorges, as represented by
Richthofen. The few fossil plants hitherto examined indicate
that the mass of these deposits are of the Mesozoic age. The
mode of working the coal mines is described by Pumpelly,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and
was probably no worse two thousand five hundred years ago.
Want of machinery for draining them prevents the miners
from going much below the water-level, and a rain-storm will
sometimes flood and ruin a shaft. An inclined plane seldom
takes the workmen more than a hundred feet below the level
of the mouth, and then a horizontal gallery conducts him to
the end of the mine. Some water is bailed out by buckets
handed from one level up to another at the top, and the coal
is carried out in baskets on the miners’ backs, or dragged in
sleds over smooth, round sticks along passages too low for the
coolies to do better than crawl as they work. Mr. Pumpelly
found the gallery of one mine near Peking so low that he
had to crawl the whole distance (six thousand feet) to see its
construction, and when he emerged into daylight, with his
knees nearly skinned, ascertained that the workmen padded
theirs. The timbering is very expensive, yet, with all drawbacks,
the coal sells, at the pit’s mouth, for $2.00 down to 50
cents a ton. The mines, lying on the slopes of the plateau
reaching from near Corea to the Yellow River, supply the plain
with cheap and excellent fuel.</p>

<p>Blakiston gives an account of the manner in which coal is
worked on the Upper Yangtsz’, near the town of Süchau:
“Having to be got out at a great height up in the cliff, very
thick hawsers, made of plaited bamboo, are tightly stretched
from the mouth, or near the mouth, of the working gallery, to
a space near the water where the coal can be deposited. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
ropes are in pairs, and large pannier-shaped baskets are made
to traverse on them, a rope passing from one over a large wheel
at the upper landing, and down again to the other, so that the
full basket going down pulls the empty one up, the velocity
being regulated by a kind of brake on the wheel at the top.
At some places the height at which the coal is worked is so
great that two or more of these contrivances are used, one taking
to a landing half way down, and another from thence to the
river. The hawsers are kept taut by a windlass for that purpose
at the bottom.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> This useful mineral appears to be abundant
throughout Sz’chuen Province, and is used here much less
sparingly than in the east. With such inexpensive methods of
getting coal to the water-courses, foreign machinery can hardly
be expected to reduce its price very materially.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>COAL GORGE ON THE YANGTSZ’. (FROM BLAKISTON.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The economical use of coal in the household and the arts has
been carried to great perfection. Anthracite is powdered and
mixed with wet clay, earth, sawdust or dung, according to the
exigencies of the case, in the proportion of about seven to one;
the balls thus made are dried in the sun. The brick-beds
(<i>kang</i>) are effective means of warming the house, and the hand
furnaces enable the poor to cook with these balls&mdash;aided by a
little charcoal or kindlings&mdash;at a trifling expense. This form
of consumption is common north of the Yellow River, and brings
coal within reach of multitudes who otherwise would suffer and
starve. Bituminous, brown, and other varieties of coal occur
in the same abundance and extent as in other great areas, giving
promise of adequate supplies for future ages. The coal
worked on the Peh kiang, in Kwangtung, contains sulphur,
and is employed in the manufacture of copperas.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BUILDING STONES AND MINERALS.</div>

<p>Crystallized gypsum is brought from the northwest of the
province to Canton, and is ground to powder in mills; plaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of Paris and other forms of this sulphate are common all over
China. It is not used as a manure, but the flour is mixed with
wood-oil to form a cement for paying the seams of boats after
they have been caulked. The powder is employed as a dentifrice,
a cosmetic, and a medicine, and sometimes, also, is boiled
to make a gruel in fevers, under the idea that it is cooling. The
bakers who supplied the English troops at Amoy, in 1843,
occasionally put it into the bread to make it heavier, but not, as
was erroneously charged upon them, with any design of poisoning
their customers, for they do not think it noxious; its employment
in coloring green tea, and adulterating powdered
sugar, is also explainable by other motives than a wish to injure
the consumers.</p>

<p>Limestone is abundant at Canton, both common clouded marble
and blue limestone; the last is extensively used in the
artificial rockwork of gardens. Even if the Cantonese knew of
the existence of lime in limestone, which they generally do not,
the expense of fuel for calcining it would prevent their burning
it while oyster-shells are so abundant in that region. In other
provinces stone-lime is burned, by the aid of coal, in small kilns.
The fine marble quarried near Peking is regarded as fit alone
for imperial uses, and is seen only in such places as the Altar
of Heaven and palace grounds. The marble used for floors is a
fissile crystallized limestone, unsusceptible of polish; no statues
or ornaments are sculptured from this mineral, but slabs are
sometimes wrought out, and the surfaces curiously stained and
corroded with acids, forming rude representations of animals or
other figures, so as to convey the appearance of natural markings.
Some of these simulated petrifactions are exceedingly
well done. Slabs of argillaceous slate are also chosen with
reference to their layers, and treated in the same manner. An
excellent granite is used about Canton and Amoy for building,
and no people exceed the Chinese in cutting it. Large slabs are
split out by wooden wedges, cut for basements and foundations,
and laid in a beautiful manner; pillars are also hewn from
single stones of different shapes, though of no extraordinary
dimensions, and their shafts embellished with inscriptions.
Ornamental walls are frequently formed of large slabs set in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
posts, like panels, the outer faces of which are beautifully carved
with figures representing a landscape or procession. Red and
gray sandstone, gneiss, mica slate, and other species of rock, are
also worked for pavements and walls.</p>

<p>Nitre is cheap and common enough in the northern provinces
to obviate any fear of its being smuggled into the country from
abroad; it is obtained in Chihlí by lixiviating the soil, and
furnishes material for the manufacture of gunpowder. A lye
is obtained from ashes, which partially serves the purposes of
soap; but the people are still ignorant of the processes necessary
for manufacturing it. Fourteen localities of alum are
given in Pumpelly’s list, but the greatest supply for the eastern
provinces comes from deposits of shale, in Ping-yang hien, in
Chehkiang, which produces about six thousand tons annually.
It is used mostly by the dyers, also to purify turbid water, and
whiten paper. Other earthy salts are known and used, as borax,
sal-ammoniac (which is collected in Mongolia and Ílí from
lakes and the vicinity of extinct volcanoes), and blue and white
vitriol, obtained by roasting pyrites. Common salt is procured
along the eastern and southern coasts by evaporating sea-water,
rock-salt not having been noticed; in the western provinces
and Shansí, it is obtained from artesian wells and lakes
as cheaply as from the ocean; in Tsing-yen hien, in Central
Sz’chuen, two hundred and thirty-seven wells are worked. At
Chusan the sea-water is so turbid that the inhabitants filter it
through clay, afterward evaporating the water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JADE STONE, OR YUH.</div>

<p>The minerals heretofore found in China have, for the most
part, been such as have attracted the attention of the natives,
and collected by them for curiosity or sale. The skilful manner
in which their lapidaries cut crystal, agate, and other
quartzose minerals, is well known.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The corundum used for
polishing and finishing these carvings occurs in China, but a
good deal of emery in powder is obtained from Borneo. A
composition of granular corundum and gum-lac is usually employed
by workmen in order to produce the highest lustre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
which the stones are capable. The three varieties of the silicate
of alumina, called jade, nephrite, and jadeite by mineralogists,
are all named <i>yuh</i> by the Chinese, a word which is
applied to a vast variety of stones&mdash;white marble, ruby, and
cornelian all coming under it&mdash;and therefore not easy to define.
Jade has long been known in Europe as a variety of
jasper, its separation from that stone into a species by itself
being of comparatively recent origin. Since the third edition
of Boetius, in 1647, the two minerals have been regarded as
entirely distinct. Its value in the eyes of the Chinese depends
chiefly upon its sonorousness and color. The costliest specimens
are brought from Yunnan and Khoten; a greenish-white
color is the most highly prized, a plain color of any shade
being of less value. A cargo of this mineral was once imported
into Canton from New Holland, but the Chinese would
not purchase it, owing to a fancy taken against its origin and
color. The patient toil of the workers in this hard mineral is
only equalled by the prodigious admiration with which it is
regarded; both fairly exhibit the singular taste and skill of the
Chinese. Its color is usually a greenish-white, or grayish-green
and dark grass-green; internally it is scarcely glimmering. Its
fracture is splintery; splinters white; mass semi-transparent
and cloudy; it scratches glass strongly, and can itself generally
be scratched by flint or quartz, but while not excessively hard
it is remarkable for toughness. The stone when freshly broken
is less hard than after a short exposure. Specific gravity from
2.9 to 3.1.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Fischer (pp. 314-318) gives some one hundred and
fifty names as occurring in various authors&mdash;ancient and modern&mdash;for
jade or nephrite.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> An interesting testimony to the esteem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
in which this stone was held in China during the middle ages
comes from Benedict Goës (1602), who says: “There is no article
of traffic more valuable than lumps of a certain transparent
kind of marble, which we, from poverty of language, usually
call jasper.... Out of this marble they fashion a variety of
articles, such as vases, brooches for mantles and girdles, which,
when artistically sculptured in flowers and foliage, certainly
have an effect of no small magnificence. These marbles (with
which the Empire is now overflowing) are called by the Chinese
Iusce. There are two kinds of it; the first and more valuable
is got out of the river at Cotan, almost in the same way
in which divers fish for gems, and this is usually extracted in
pieces about as big as large flints. The other and inferior
kind is excavated from the mountains.” The ruby, diamond,
amethyst, sapphire, topaz, pink tourmaline, lapis-lazuli,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> turquoises,
beryl, garnet, opal, agate, and other stones, are known
and most of them used in jewelry. A ruby brought from
Peking is noticed by Bell as having been valued in Europe at
$50,000. The seals of the Boards are in many instances cut on
valuable stones, and private persons take great pride in quartz
or jade seals, with their names carved on them; lignite and
jet are likewise employed for cheaper ornaments, of which all
classes are fond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">METALS AND THEIR PRODUCTION.</div>

<p>All the common metals, except platina, are found in China,
and the supply would be sufficient for all the purposes of the
inhabitants, if they could avail themselves of the improvements
adopted in other countries in blasting, mining, etc. The
importations of iron, lead, tin, and quicksilver, are gradually
increasing, but they form only a small proportion of the amount
used throughout the Empire, especially of the two first named;
iron finds its way in because of its convenient forms more than
its cheapness. The careful examination of Chinese topographical
works by Pumpelly,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> records the leading localities of iron in
every province, and where copper, tin, lead, silver, and quicksilver
have been observed; he also mentions fifty-two places pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>ducing
gold in various forms, most of them in Sz’chuen. The
rumor of gold-washings occurring not far from Chifu, in Shantung,
caused much excitement in 1868, but they were soon found
to be not worth the labor. Gold has never been used as coin in
China, but is wrought into jewelry; most of it is consumed in
gilding and exported to India as bullion, in the shape of small
bars or coarse leaves.</p>

<p>Silver is mentioned in sixty-three localities by the same author;
large amounts are brought from Yunnan, and the mines in that
region must be both extensive and easily worked to afford such
large quantities as have been exported. The working of both
gold and silver mines has been said to be prohibited, but this
interdiction is rather a government monopoly of the mines than
an injunction upon working those which are known. The importation
of gold into China during the two centuries the trade
has been opened, does not probably equal the exportation which
has taken place since the commencement of the opium trade.
It is altogether improbable that the Chinese are acquainted
with the properties of quicksilver in separating these two
metals from their ores, though its consumption in making vermilion
and looking-glasses calls for over two thousand flasks
yearly at Canton. Cinnabar occurs in Kweichau and Shensí
and furnishes most of the “water silver,” as the Chinese call
it, by a rude process of burning brushwood in the wells, and
collecting the metal after condensation.</p>

<p>Copper is used for manufacturing coin, bells, bronze articles,
domestic and cooking utensils, cannon, gongs, and brass-foil.
It is found pure in some instances, and the sulphuret, the blue
and green carbonates, pyrities, and other ores are worked; malachite
is ground for a paint. It occurs in every province, and
is specially rich in Shansí and Kweichau. The ores of zinc
and copper in Yunnan and Sz’chuen furnish spelter, and the
peculiar alloy known as white copper or argentan, containing in
addition tin, iron, nickel, and lead. So much use indicates
large deposits of the ores. Tin is rather abundant, but lead is
more common; thirty-nine localities of the first are mentioned,
some of which are probably zinc ores, as the Chinese confound
tin and zinc under one generic name. Lead occurs with silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
in many places; twenty-four mines are mentioned in Pumpelly’s
list, and those in Fuhkien are rich; but the extensive importations
prove that its reduction is too expensive to compete with
the foreign.</p>

<p>Realgar is quite common, this and orpiment being used as
paints; statuettes and other articles are carved from the former,
while arsenic is used in agriculture to quicken grain and preserve
it from insects. Amber and fossilized copal are collected
in several localities; the first is much employed in the making
of court necklaces and hair ornaments. The <i>fei-tsui</i> or jadeite
is the most prized of the semi-precious stones; it is cut into
ear-rings, finger-rings, necklaces, etc. Pumpelly mentions pieces
of this mineral set in relics obtained from tombs in Mexico,
though no locality where it abounds has yet been found in
America. Lapis-lazuli is employed in painting upon copper
and porcelain ware; this mineral is obtained in Chehkiang and
Kansuh; jadeite, topaz, and other fine stones are most plenty
in Yunnan. A few minerals and fossils have been noticed in
the vicinity and shops at Canton, but China thus far has furnished
very few petrifactions in any strata. Coarse epidote
occurs at Macao, and tungstate of iron has been noticed in the
quartz rocks at Hongkong. Petrified crabs (<i>macrophthalmus</i>)
have been brought to Canton from Hainan, which are prized
by the natives for their supposed medicinal qualities. Scientists
have hitherto described a score or more species of Devonian
shells, and recognized fragments of the hyena, tapir,
rhinoceros, and stegedon, among some other doubtful vertebratæ
in the “dragon’s bones” sold in medicine shops; but
further examinations will doubtless increase the list. Orthoceratites
and bivalve shells of various kinds are noticed in
Chinese books as being found in rocks, and fossil bones of huge
size in caves and river banks.</p>

<p>There are many hot springs and other indications of volcanic
action along the southern acclivities of the table land in the
provinces of Shensí and Sz’chuen; and at Jeh-ho, in Chihlí,
there are thermal springs to which invalids resort. The <i>Ho
tsing</i>, or Fire wells, in Sz’chuen are apertures resembling artesian
springs, sunk in the rock to a depth of one thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
five hundred or one thousand eight hundred feet, whilst their
breadth does not exceed five or six inches. This is a work
of great difficulty, and requires in some cases the labor of
two or three years. The water procured from them contains
a fifth part of salt, which is very acrid, and mixed with much
nitre. When a lighted torch is applied to the mouth of
some of those which have no water, fire is produced with
great violence and a noise like thunder, bursting out into a
flame twenty or thirty feet high, and which cannot be extinguished
without great danger and expense. The gas has a
bituminous smell, and burns with a bluish flame and a quantity
of thick, black smoke. It is conducted under boilers in bamboos,
and employed in evaporating the salt-water from the
other springs.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Besides the gaseous and aqueous springs in
these provinces, there are others possessing different qualities,
some sulphurous and others chalybeate, found in Shansí and
along the banks of the Yellow River. Sulphur occurs, as has
been noted, in great abundance in Formosa, and is purified for
powder manufacturers.</p>

<p>The animal and vegetable productions of the extensive regions
under the sway of the Emperor of China include a great
variety of types of different families. On the south the
islands of Hainan and Formosa, and parts of the adjacent
coasts, slightly partake of a tropical character, exhibiting in the
cocoanuts, plantains, and peppers, the parrots, lemurs, and
monkeys, decided indications of an equatorial climate. From
the eastern coast across through the country to the northwest
provinces occur mountain ranges of gradually increasing elevation,
interspersed with intervales and alluvial plateaus and bottoms,
lakes and rivers, plains and hills, each presenting its
peculiar productions, both wild and cultivated, in great variety
and abundance. The southern ascent of the high land of Mongolia,
the uncultivated wilds of Manchuria, the barren wastes
of the desert of Gobi, with its salt lakes, glaciers, extinct volcanoes,
and isolated mountain ranges; and lastly the stupendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
chains and valleys of Tibet, Koko-nor, and Kwănlun all differ
from each other in the character of their productions. In one
or the other division, every variety of soil, position, and temperature
occur which are known on the globe; and what has
been ascertained within the past fifteen years by enterprising
naturalists is an earnest of future greater discoveries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUADRUMANOUS ANIMALS OF CHINA.</div>

<p>Of the quadrumanous order of animals, there are several
species. The Chinese are skilful in teaching the smaller kinds
of monkeys various tricks, but M. Breton’s picture of their
adroitness and usefulness in picking tea in Shantung from
plants growing on otherwise inaccessible acclivities, is a fair instance
of one of the odd stories furnished by travellers about
China, inasmuch as no tea grows in Shantung, and monkeys
are taught more profitable tricks.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> One of the most remarkable
animals of this tribe is the <i>douc</i>, or Cochinchinese monkey
(<i>Semnopithecus nemæus</i>). It is a large species of great rarity,
and remarkable for the variety of colors with which it is
adorned. Its body is about two feet long, and when standing
in an upright position its height is considerably greater. The
face is of an orange color, and flattened in its form. A dark
band runs across the front of the forehead, and the sides of the
countenance are bounded by long spreading yellowish tufts of
hair. The body and upper parts of the forearms are brownish
gray, the lower portions of the arms, from the elbows to the
wrists, being white; its hands and thighs are black, and the
legs of a bright red color, while the tail and a large triangular
spot above it are pure white. Such a creature matches well,
for its grotesque and variegated appearance, with the mandarin
duck and gold fish, also peculiar to China.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FÍ-FÍ AND HAI-TUH.</div>

<p>Chinese books speak of several species of this family, and
small kinds occur in all the provinces. M. David has recently
added two novelties to the list from his acquisitions in Eastern
Koko-nor, well fitted for that cold region by their abundant
hair. The <i>Rhinopithecus roxellanæ</i> inhabits the alpine forests,
nearly two miles high, where it subsists on the buds of plants
and bamboo shoots laid up for winter supply; its face is green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>ish,
the nose remarkably <i>rétroussé</i>, and its strong, brawny limbs
well fitted for the arboreal life it leads; the hair is thick and
like a mane on the back, shaded with yellow and white tints.
In this respect it is like the Gelada monkey of Abyssinia, and
a few others protected in this part of the body from cold. This
is no doubt the kind called <i>fí-fí</i> in native books, and once
found in flocks along many portions of western China, as these
authors declare. Their notices are rather tantalizing, but, now
that we have found the animal, are worth quoting: “The
<i>fí-fí</i> resembles a man; it is clothed with its hair, runs quick
and eats men; it has a human face, long lips, black, hairy
body, and turns its heels. It laughs on seeing a man and
covers its eyes with its lips; it can talk and its voice resembles
a bird. It occurs in Sz’chuen, where it is called <i>jin hiung</i>, or
‘human bear;’ its palms are good eating, and its skin is used;
its habit is to turn over stones, seeking for crabs as its food.
Its form is like that of the men who live in the Kwănlun
Mountains.”</p>

<p>Another large simia (<i>Macacus thibetanus</i>) comes from the
same region; it lives in bands like the preceding, but lower
down the mountains. A third species of great size was reported
to occur in the southwestern part of Sz’chuen, and described
as greenish like the <i>Macacus tcheliensis</i> from the hills
northwest of Peking&mdash;the most northern species of monkey
known. The former of these two may possibly be the <i>sing-sing</i>
of the Chinese books, though its characteristics involve
some confusion of the Macacus and baboon on the part of those
writers. Two other species of Macacus, and as many of the
gibbons, have been noticed in Hainan, Formosa, and elsewhere
in the south.</p>

<p>The singular proboscis monkey (<i>Nasalis laivalus</i>), called
<i>khi-doc</i> in Cochinchina and <i>hai-tuh</i> by the Chinese, exhibits a
strange profile, part man and part beast, reminding one of the
combinations in Da Vinci’s caricatures. It is a large animal,
covered with soft yellowish hair tinted with red; the long nose
projects in the form of a sloping spatula. The Chinese account
says: “Its nose is turned upward, and the tail very long and
forked at the end, and that whenever it rains, the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
thrusts the forks into its nose. It goes in herds, and lives in
friendship; when one dies, the rest accompany it to burial.
Its activity is so great that it runs its head against the trees;
its fur is soft and gray, and the face black.”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Chinese Herbal</cite>, from which the preceding extract is
taken, describes the bat under various names, such as ‘heavenly
rat,’ ‘fairy rat,’ ‘flying rat,’ ‘night swallow,’ and ‘belly wings;’
it also details the various uses made of the animal in medicine,
and the extraordinary longevity attained by some of the white
species. The bat is in form like a mouse; its body is of an
ashy black color; and it has thin fleshy wings, which join the
four legs and tail into one. It appears in the summer, but becomes
torpid in the winter; on which account, as it eats nothing
during that season, and because it has a habit of swallowing its
breath, it attains a great age. It has the character of a night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
rover, not on account of any inability to fly in the day, but it
dares not go abroad at that time because it fears a kind of
hawk. It subsists on mosquitoes and gnats. It flies with its
head downward, because the brain is heavy.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> This quotation
is among the best Chinese descriptions of animals, and shows
how little there is to depend upon in them, though not without
interest in their notices of habits. Bats are common everywhere,
and seem to be regarded with less aversion than in certain
other countries. Twenty species belonging to nine genera
are given in one list, most of them found in southern China; the
wings of some of these measure two feet across; a large sort in
Sz’chuen is eaten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILD ANIMALS.</div>

<p>The brown bear is known, and its paws are regarded as a
delicacy; trained animals are frequently brought into cities by
showmen, who have taught them tricks. The discovery by
David of a large species (<i>Ailuropus melanoleurus</i>) allied to the
Himalayan panda (<i>Ailurus fulgens</i>), also found on the Sz’chuen
Mountains, adds another instance of the strange markings common
in Tibetan fauna. This beast feeds on flesh and vegetables;
its body is white, but the ears, eyes, legs, and tip of the
tail are quite black; the fur is thick and coarse. It is called
<i>peh hiung</i>, or white bear, by the hunters, but is no doubt the
animal called <i>pi</i> in the classics, common in early times over
western China, and now rare even in Koko-nor. The Tibetan
black bear occurs in Formosa, Shantung, and Hainan, showing
a wide range. The badger is quite as widespread, and the two
species have the same general appearance as their European
congeners.</p>

<p>Carnivorous animals still exist, even in thickly settled districts.
The lion may once have roamed over the southwestern
Manji kingdom, but the name and drawings both indicate a
foreign origin. It has much connection with Buddhism, and
grotesque sculptures of rampant lions stand in pairs in front of
temples, palaces, and graves, as a mark of honor and symbol
of protection. The last instance of a live lion brought as tribute
was to Hientsung in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1470, from India or Ceylon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Many other species of <i>felis</i> are known, some of them peculiar
to particular regions. The royal tiger has been killed near
Amoy, and in Manchuria the panther, leopard, and tiger-cat
all occur in the northern and southern provinces, making
altogether a list of twelve species ranging from Formosa to
Sagalien. Mr. Swinhoe’s<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> account of his rencounter with a
tiger near Amoy in 1858 explains how such large animals still
remain in thickly settled regions where food is abundant and
the people are timid and unarmed. In thinly peopled parts
they become a terror to the peasants. M. David enumerates
six kinds, including a lynx, in Monpin alone, one of which
(<i>Felis scripta</i>) is among the most prettily marked of the whole
family. Hunting-leopards and tigers were used in the days of
Marco Polo by Kublai, but the manly pastime of the chase, on
the magnificent scale then practised, has fallen into disuse with
the present princes. A small and fierce species of wild-cat
(<i>Felis chinensis</i>), two feet long, of a brownish-gray color, and
handsomely marked with chestnut spots and black streaks, is
still common in the southwestern portions of Fuhkien. Civet
cats of two or three kinds, tree-civets (<i>Helictes</i>), and a fine
species of marten (<i>Martes</i>), with yellow neck and purplish-brown
body, from Formosa, are among the smaller carnivora in
the southern provinces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CATS AND DOGS.</div>

<p>The domestic animals offer few peculiarities. The cat, <i>kia lí</i>,
or ‘household fox,’ is a favorite inmate of families, and the
ladies of Peking are fond of a variety of the Angora cat,
having long silky hair and hanging ears. The common species
is variously marked, and in the south often destitute of a tail;
when reared for food it is fed on rice and vegetables, but is not
much eaten. Popular superstition has clustered many omens of
good and bad luck about cats; it is considered, for example,
the prognostic of certain misfortune when a cat is stolen from
a house&mdash;much as, in some countries of the western world, it is
unlucky when a black cat crosses one’s pathway.</p>

<p>The dog differs but little from that reared among the Esquimaux,
and is perhaps the original of the species. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
little variation in their size, which is about a foot high and
two feet in length; the color is a pale yellow or black, and
always uniform, with coarse bristling hair, and tails curling up
high over the back, and rising so abruptly from the insertion
that it has been humorously remarked they almost assist in
lifting the legs from the ground. The hind legs are unusually
straight, which gives them an awkward look, and perhaps prevents
them running very rapidly. The black eyes are small
and piercing, and the insides of the lips and mouths, and the
tongue, are of the same color, or a blue black. The bitch has a
dew-claw on each hind leg, but the dog has none. The ears are
sharp and upright, the head peaked, and the bark a short, thick
snap, very unlike the deep, sonorous baying of our mastiffs. In
Nganhwui a peculiar variety has pendant ears of great length,
and thin, wirey tails. One item in the Chinese description of
the dog is that it ‘can go on three legs’&mdash;a gait that is often
exhibited by them. They are used to watch houses and flocks;
the Mongolian breed is fierce and powerful. The dogs of Peking
are very clannish, and each set jealously guards its own street
or yard; they are fed by the butchers in the streets, and serve
as scavengers there and in all large towns. They are often
mangey, presenting hideous spectacles, and instances of <i>plica
polonica</i> are not uncommon, but, as among the celebrated street
dogs of Constantinople, hydrophobia is almost unheard of
among them. Dog markets are seen in every city where this
meat is sold; the animals are reared expressly for the table,
but their flesh is expensive.</p>

<p>One writer remarks on their habits, when describing the
worship offered at the tombs: “Hardly had the hillock been
abandoned by the worshippers, when packs of hungry dogs
came running up to devour the part of the offerings left for the
dead, or to lick up the grease on the ground. Those who came
first held up their heads, bristled their hair, and showed a
proud and satisfied demeanor, curling and wagging their tails
with selfish delight; while the late-comers, tails between their
legs, held their heads and ears down. There was one of them,
however, which, grudging the fare, held his nose to the wind as
if sniffing for better luck; but one lean, old, and ugly beast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
with a flayed back and hairless tail, was seen gradually separating
himself from the band, though without seeming to hurry
himself, making a thousand doublings and windings, all the
while looking back to see if he was noticed. But the old
sharper knew what he was about, and as soon as he thought
himself at a safe distance, away he went like an arrow, the
whole pack after him, to some other feast and some other
tomb.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>Wolves, raccoon-dogs, and foxes are everywhere common, in
some places proving to be real pests in the sheepfold and farmyard.
In the vicinity of Peking, it is customary to draw large
white rings on the plastered walls, in order to terrify the wolves,
as these beasts, it is thought, will flee on observing such traps.
The Chinese regard the fox as the animal into which human
spirits enter in preference to any other, and are therefore afraid
to destroy or displease it. The elevated steppes are the abodes
of three or four kinds, which find food without difficulty. The
Tibetan wolf (<i>Canis chanco</i>) has a warm, yellowish-white covering,
and ranges the wilds of Tsaidam and Koko-nor in packs.
The fox (<i>Canis cossac</i>) spreads over a wide range, and is famed
for its sagacity in avoiding enemies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CATTLE, SHEEP, AND DEER.</div>

<p>The breed of cattle and horses is dwarfish, and nothing is
done to improve them. The oxen are sometimes not larger
than an ass; some of them have a small hump, showing their
affinity to the zebu; the dewlap is large, and the contour neat
and symmetrical. The forehead is round, the horns small and
irregularly curved, and the general color dun red. The buffalo
(<i>shui niu</i>), or ‘water ox,’ is the largest beast used in agriculture.
It is very docile and unwieldy, larger than an English ox, and
its hairless hide is a light black color; it seeks coolness and
refuge from the gnat in muddy pools dug for its convenience,
where it wallows with its nose just above the surface. Each
horn is nearly semi-circular, and bends downward, while the
head is turned back so as almost to bring the nose horizontal.
The herd-boys usually ride it, and the metaphor of a lad astride
a buffalo’s back, blowing the flute, frequently enters into Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
descriptions of rural life. The yak of Tibet is employed as a
beast of burden, and to furnish food and raiment. It is covered
with a mantle of hair reaching nearly to the ground, and the
soft pelage is used for making standards among the Persians,
and its tail as fly-flaps or chowries in India; the hair is woven
into carpets. The wild yak (<i>Poephagus grunniens</i>) has already
been described. Great herds of these huge bovines roam over
the wastes of Koko-nor, where their dried droppings furnish
the only fuel for the nomads crossing those barren wilds.</p>

<p>The domestic sheep is the broad-tailed species, and furnishes
excellent mutton. The tail is sometimes ten inches long and
three or four thick; and the size of this fatty member is not
affected by the temperature. The sheep are reared in the north
by Mohammedans, who prepare the fleeces for garments by
careful tanning; the animal is white, with a black head. Goats
are raised in all parts, but not in large numbers. The argali
and wild sheep of the Ala shan Mountains (<i>Ovis Burrhel</i>) furnish
exciting sport in chasing them over their native cliffs,
which they clamber with wonderful agility. Another denizen
of those dreary wilds is the <i>Antilope picticauda</i>, a small and
tiny species, weighing about forty pounds, of a dusky gray color,
with a narrow yellow stripe on the flanks. Its range is about
the head-waters of the Yangtsz’ River; its swiftness is amazing;
it seems absolutely to fly. It scrapes for itself trenches in
which to lie secure from the cold.</p>

<p>Many genera of ruminants are represented in China and
the outlying regions; twenty-seven rare species are enumerated
in Swinhoe’s and David’s lists, of which eleven are antelopes
and deer. The range of some of them is limited to a
narrow region, and most of them are peculiar to the country.
The wealthy often keep deer in their grounds, especially the
spotted deer (<i>Cervus pseudaxis</i>), from Formosa, whose coat is
found to vary greatly according to sex and age; its name, <i>kintsien
luh</i>, or ‘money deer,’ indicates its markings. Mouse-deer
are also reared as pets in the southern provinces.</p>

<p>One common species is the <i>dzeren</i> or <i>hwang yang</i> (<i>Antilope
gutturosa</i>), which roams over the Mongolian wilds in large
herds, and furnishes excellent venison. It is heavy in compar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>ison
to the gazelle; horns thick, about nine inches long, annulated
to the tips, lyrated, and their points turned inward. The
goitre, which gives it its name, is a movable protuberance occasioned
by the dilatation of the larynx; in the old males it is
much enlarged. The animal takes surprising bounds when running.
Great numbers are killed in the autumn, and their flesh,
skins, and horns are all of service for food, leather, and medicine.</p>

<p>Several kinds of hornless (or nearly hornless) deer, allied to
the musk-deer, exist. One is the river-deer (<i>Hydropotes</i>), common
near the Yangtsz’ River, which resembles the pudu of
Chili; it is very prolific on the bottoms and in the islands. Another
sort in the northwest (<i>Elaphodus</i>) is intermediary between
the muntjacs and deer, having long, trenchant, canine
upper teeth, and a deep chocolate-colored fur. Three varieties
of the musk-deer (<i>Moschus</i>) have been observed, differing a
little in their colors, all called <i>shié</i> or <i>hiang chang</i> by the Chinese,
and all eagerly hunted for their musk. This perfume
was once deemed to be useful in medicine, and is cited in a
Greek prescription of the sixth century; the abundance of the
animal in the Himalayan regions may be inferred from Tavernier’s
statement that he bought 7673 bags or pods at Patna in
one of his journeys over two hundred years ago. This animal
roams over a vast extent of alpine territory, from Tibet and
Shensí to Lake Baikal, and inhabits the loftiest cliffs and defiles,
and makes its way over rugged mountains with great rapidity.
It is not unlike the roe in general appearance, though the projecting
teeth makes the upper lip to look broad. Its color is
grayish-brown and its limbs slight; the hair is coarse and brittle,
almost like spines. The musk is contained in a pouch beneath
the tail on the male, and is most abundant during the
rutting season. He is taken in nets or shot, and the hunters
are said to allure him to destruction by secreting themselves
and playing the flute, though some would say the animal
showed very little taste in listening to such sounds as Chinese
flutes usually produce. The musk is often adulterated with
clay or mixed with other substances to moderate its powerful
odor. A singular and interesting member of this family is
reared in the great park south of Peking&mdash;a kind of elk with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
short horns. This large animal (<i>Elaphurus Davidianus</i>), of a
gentle disposition, equals in size the largest deer; its native
name, <i>sz’-puh siang</i>, indicates that it is neither a horse, a deer,
a camel, nor an ox, but partakes in some respects of the characteristics
of each of them. Its gentle croaking voice seems to be
unworthy of so huge a body; the color is a uniform fawn or
light gray.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HORSES, ASSES, AND ELEPHANTS.</div>

<p>The horse is not much larger than the Shetland pony; it is
bony and strong, but kept with little care, and presents the
worst possible appearance in its usual condition of untrimmed
coat and mane, bedraggled fetlocks, and twisted tail. The Chinese
language possesses a great variety of terms to designate
the horse; the difference of age, sex, color, and disposition, all
being denoted by particular characters. Piebald and mottled,
white and bay horses are common; but the improvement of
this noble animal is neglected, and he looks sorry enough compared
with the coursers of India. He is principally used for
carrying the post, or for military services; asses and mules
being more employed for draught. He is hardy, feeds on
coarse food, and admirably serves his owners. The mule is
well-shaped, and those raised for the gentry are among the very
best in the world for endurance and strength; dignitaries are
usually drawn by sumpter mules. Donkeys are also carefully
raised. Chinese books speak of a mule of a cow and horse, as
well as from the ass and horse, though, of course, no such hybrid
as the former ever existed.</p>

<p>The wild ass, or onager (under the several names by which
it is known in different lands, <i>kyang</i>, <i>djang</i>, <i>kulan</i>, <i>djiggetai</i>,
<i>ghor-khar</i>, and <i>yé-lu</i>), still roams free and untameable. It is
abundant in Koko-nor, gathering in troops of ten to fifty, each
under the lead of a stallion to defend the mares. The flesh is
highly prized, and the difficulty of procuring it adds to the
delicacy of the dish; the color is light chestnut, with white
belly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WILD BOAR AND DOMESTIC HOG.</div>

<p>Elephants are kept at Peking for show, and are used to
draw the state chariot when the Emperor goes to worship at
the Altars of Heaven and Earth, but the sixty animals seen in
the days of Kienlung, by Bell, have since dwindled to one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
two. Van Braam met six going into Peking, sent thither from
Yunnan. The deep forests of that province also harbor the
rhinoceros and tapir. The horn of the former is sought after
as medicine, and the best pieces are carved most beautifully into
ornaments or into drinking cups, which are supposed to sweat
whenever any poisonous liquid is put into them. The tapir is
the white and brown animal found in the Malacca peninsula,
and strange stories are recorded of its eating stones and copper.
The wild boar grows to weigh over four hundred pounds and
nearly six feet long. In cold weather its frozen carcass is
brought to Peking, and sold at a high price. A new species of
hog has been found in Formosa, about three feet long, twenty-one
inches high, and showing a dorsal row of large bristles; a
third variety occurs among the novelties discovered in Sz’chuen
(<i>Sus moupinensis</i>), having short ears. Wild boars are met with
even in the hills of Chehkiang, and seriously annoy the husbandmen
in the lowlands by their depredations. Deep pits are
dug near the base of the hills, and covered with a bait of fresh
grass, and many are annually captured or drowned in them.
They are fond of the bamboo shoots, and persons are stationed
near the groves to frighten them away by striking pieces of
wood together.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>The Chinese Pig.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Chinese hollow-backed pig is known for its short legs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
round body, crooked back, and abundance of fat; the flesh is
the common meat of the people south of the Yangtsz’ River.
The black Chinese breed, as it is called in England, is considered
the best pork raised in that country. The hog in the
northern provinces is a gaunt animal, uniformly black, and not
so well cared for as its southern rival. Piebald pigs are common
in Formosa, resulting from crossing; sometimes animals
of this kind are quite woolly. The Chinese in the south, well
aware of the perverse disposition of the hog, find it much more
expeditious to carry instead of drive him through their narrow
streets. For this purpose cylindrical baskets, open at both ends,
are made; and in order to capture the obstinate brute, it is
secured just outside the half-opened gate of the pen. The men
seize him by the tail and pull it lustily; his rage is roused by
the pain, and he struggles; they let go their hold, whereupon
he darts out of the gate to escape, and finds himself snugly
caught. He is lifted up and unresistingly carried off.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Mode of Carrying Pigs.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The camel is employed in the trade carried on across the
desert, and throughout Mongolia, Manchuria, and northern
China near the plateau; without his aid those regions would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
be impassible; the passes across the ranges near Koko-nor, sixteen
thousand feet high, are traversed by his help, though amid
suffering and danger. In the summer season it sheds all its
hair, which is gathered for weaving into ropes and rugs; at this
period, large herds pasture on the plateau to recuperate. The
humps at this season hang down the back like empty bags, and
the poor animal presents a distressed appearance during the hot
weather. In its prime condition it carries about six hundred
pounds weight, but is not used to ride upon as is the Arabian
species. The two kinds serve man in one continuous <i>kafilah</i>
from the Sea of Tartary across two continents to Timbuctoo.
The Chinese have employed the camel in war, and trained it to
carry small gingalls so that the riders could fire them while
resting on its head, but this antique kind of cavalry has disappeared
with the introduction of better weapons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SMALLER ANIMALS AND RODENTS.</div>

<p>Among the various tribes of smaller animals, the Chinese
Empire furnishes many interesting peculiarities, and few families
are unrepresented. No marsupials have yet been met, and
the order of edentata is still restricted to one instance. Several
families in other orders are rare or wanting, as baboons,
spider-monkeys, skunks, and ichneumons. In the weasel tribe,
some new species have been added to the already long list of
valuable fur-bearing animals found in the mountains&mdash;the sable
ermine, marten, pole-cat, stoat, etc., whose skins still repay the
hunters. The weasel is common, but not troublesome. The
otter is trained in Sz’chuen to catch fish in the mountain
streams with the docility of a spaniel; another species (<i>Lutia
swinhosi</i>) occurs along the islands on the southern coast, while
in Hainan Island appears a kind of clawless otter of a rich
brown color above and white beneath; each of these is about
twenty inches long. The furs of all these, and also the sea-otter,
are prepared for garments, especially collars and neck-wraps.</p>

<p>A kind of mole exists in Sz’chuen, having a muzzle of extreme
length, while the scent of another variety near Peking is so
musky as to suggest its name (<i>Scaptochirus moschatus</i>). Muskrats
and shrew-mice are found both north and south; and one
western species has only a rudimentary tail; while another, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
<i>Scaptonyx</i>, forms an intermediate species between a mole and a
shrew, having a blunt muzzle, strong fore feet and a long tail;
and lastly, a sort fitted for aquatic habits, with broad hind feet
and flattened tail. Tiny hedgehogs are common even in the
streets and by-lanes of Peking, where they find food and
refuge in the alluvial earth. Two or three kinds of marmots
and mole-rats are found in the north and west (<i>Siphucus Arctomys</i>),
all specifically unlike their congeners elsewhere. The
Chinese have a curious fancy in respect to one beast, one bird,
and one fish, each of which, they say, requires that two come
together to make one complete animal, viz., the jerboa, the
spoonbill and sole-fish; the first (<i>Dipus annulatus</i>) occurs in
the sands of northern China, the second in Formosa, and the
third along the coasts.</p>

<p>Many kinds of rodents have been described. The alpine
hare (<i>Lagomys ogotona</i>) resembles a marmot in its habits and is
met with throughout the grassy parts of the steppes; its burrows
riddle the earth wherever the little thing gathers, and endangers
the hunters riding over it. It is about the size of a rat,
and by its wonderful fecundity furnishes food to a great number
of its enemies&mdash;man, beasts, and birds; it is not dormant, but
gathers dry grass for food and warmth during cold weather;
this winter store is, however, often consumed by cattle before
it is stored away. Hares and rabbits are well known. Two
species of the former are plenty on the Mongolian grass-lands,
one of which has very long feet; in winter their frozen bodies
are brought to market. One species is restricted to Hainan
Island. Ten or twelve kinds of squirrels have been described,
red, gray, striped, and buff; one with fringed ears. Their skins
are prepared for the furriers, and women wear winter robes
lined with them. Two genera of flying-squirrel (<i>Pteromys</i> and
<i>Sciuropterus</i>) have been noticed, the latter in Formosa and the
former mostly in the western provinces. Chinese writers have
been puzzled to class the flying-squirrel; they place it among
birds, and assure their readers that it is the only kind which
suckles its young when it flies, and that “the skin held in the
hand during parturition renders delivery easier, because the
animal has a remarkably lively disposition.” The long, dense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
fur of the <i>P. alborufous</i> makes beautiful dresses, the white
tips of the hair contrasting prettily with the red ground.</p>

<p>Of the proper rats and mice, more than twenty-five species
have been already described. Some of them are partially
arboreal, others have remarkably long tails, and all but three
are peculiar to the country. A Formosan species, called by
Swinhoe the spinous country rat, had been dedicated to Koxinga,
the conqueror of that island; while another common
in Sz’chuen bears the name of <i>Mus Confucianus</i>. The extent
to which the Chinese eat rats has been greatly exaggerated
by travellers, for the flesh is too expensive for general
use.</p>

<p>One species of porcupine (<i>Hystrix subcristata</i>) inhabits the
southern provinces, wearing on its head a purplish-black crest
of stout spines one to five inches long; the bristles are short,
but increase in size and length to eight or nine inches toward
the rump; the entire length is thirty-three inches. The popular
notion that the porcupine darts its quills at its enemies as
an effectual weapon is common among the Chinese.</p>

<p>No animal has puzzled the Chinese more than the scaly ant-eater
or pangolin (<i>Manis dalmanni</i>), which is logically considered
as a certain and useful remedy by them, simply because of
its oddity. It is regarded as a fish out of water, and therefore
named <i>ling-lí</i>, or ‘hill carp,’ also dragon carp, but the most
common designation is <i>chuen shan kiah</i>, or the ‘scaly hill borer.’
One author says: “Its shape resembles a crocodile; it can go in
dry paths as well as in the water; it has four legs. In the
daytime it ascends the banks of streams, and lying down opens
its scales wide, putting on the appearance of death, which induces
the ants to enter between them. As soon as they are in,
the animal closes its scales and returns to the water to open
them; the ants float out dead, and he devours them at leisure.”
A more accurate observer says: “It continually protrudes its
tongue to entice the ants on which it feeds;” and true to
Chinese physiological deductions, <i>similia similibus curantur</i>,
he recommends the scales as a cure for all antish swellings.
He also remarks that the scales are not bony, and consist of
the agglutinated hairs of the body. The adult specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
measure thirty-three inches. It walks on the sides of the
hind feet and tips of the claws of the fore feet, and can stand
upright for a minute or two. The large scales are held to
the skin by a fleshy nipple-like pimple, which adheres to the
base.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PORPOISES AND WHALES.</div>

<p>Among the cetaceous inhabitants of the Chinese waters, one
of the most noticeable is the great white porpoise (<i>Delphinus
chinensis</i>), whose uncouth tumbles attract the traveller’s notice
as he sails into the estuary of the Pearl River on his way to
Hongkong, and again as he steams up the Yangtsz’ to Hankow.
The Chinese fishermen are shy of even holding it in their nets,
setting it free at once, and never pursuing it; they call it <i>peh-kí</i>
and deem its presence favorable to their success. A species of
fin-whale (<i>Balænoptera</i>) has been described by Swinhoe, which
ranges the southern coast from the shores of Formosa to Hainan.
Its presence between Hongkong and Amoy induced some
foreigners to attempt a fishery in those waters, but the yield of
oil and bone was too small for their outlay. The native fishermen
join their efforts in the winter, when it resorts to the seas
near Hainan, going out in fleets of small boats from three to
twenty-five tons burden each, fifty boats going together. The
line is about three hundred and fifty feet long, made of native
hemp, and fastened to the mast, the end leading over the bow.
The harpoon has one barb, and is attached to a wooden handle;
through an eye near the socket, the line is so fastened along the
handle, that when the whale begins to strain upon it, the handle
draws out upon the line, leaving only the barb buried in the
skin. The boat is sailed directly upon the fish, and the harpooner
strikes from the bow just behind the blow-hole. As
soon as the fish is struck the sail is lowered, the rudder unshipped,
and the boat allowed to drag stern foremost until the
prey is exhausted. Other boats come up to assist, and half a
dozen harpoons soon dispatch it. The species most common
there yield about fifty barrels each; the oil, flesh, and bone are
all used for food or in manufactures. The fish resort to the
shallow waters in those seas for food, and to roll and rub on the
banks and reefs, thus ridding themselves of the barnacles and
insects which torment them; they are often seen leaping en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>tirely
out of water, and falling back perpendicularly against the
hard bottom.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>The Yellow Sea affords a species of cow-fish, or round-headed
cachalot (<i>Globicephalus Rissii</i>), which the Japanese capture.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
Seals have been observed on the coast of Liautung, but nothing
is known of their species or habits; the skins are common and
cheap in the Peking market. Native books speak of a marine
animal in Koko-nor, from which a rare medicine is obtained,
that probably belongs to this family.</p>

<p>This imperfect account of the mammalia known to exist
in China has been drawn from the lists and descriptions inserted
in the zoölogical periodicals of Europe, and may serve to
indicate the extent and richness of the field yet to be investigated.
The lists of Swinhoe and David alone contain nearly
two hundred species, and within the past ten years scores more
have been added, but have not exhausted the new and unexplored
zoölogical regions. The emperors of the Mongol dynasty
were very fond of the chase, and famous for their love of the
noble amusement of falconry; Marco Polo says that Kublai employed
no less than seventy thousand attendants in his hawking
excursions. Falcons, kites, and other birds were taught to
pursue their quarry, and the Venetian speaks of eagles trained
to stoop at wolves, and of such size and strength that none
could escape their talons.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Ranking has collected<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> a number
of notices of the mode and sumptuousness of the field sports of
the Mongols in China and India, but they convey little more
information to the naturalist, than that the game was abundant
and comprised a vast variety. Many species of accipitrine
birds are described in Chinese books, but they are spoken of so
vaguely that nothing definite can be learned from the notices.
Few of them are now trained for sport by the Chinese, except
a kind of sparrow-hawk to amuse dilettanti hunters in
showing their skill in catching small birds. The fondness for
sport in the wilds of Manchuria which the old emperors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
encouraged two centuries ago has all died out among their descendants.</p>

<p>Within the last fifteen years a greater advance has been
made in the knowledge of the birds of China than in any other
branch of its natural history, perhaps owing somewhat to their
presenting themselves for capture to the careful observer. The
list of described species already numbers over seven hundred, of
which the careful paper of the lamented Swinhoe, in the <cite>Proceedings
of the Zoölogical Society</cite> for May, 1871, gives the
names of six hundred and seventy-five species, and M. David’s
list, in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouvelles Archives</cite> for 1871, gives four hundred and
seventy as the number observed north of the River Yangtsz’.
The present sketch must confine itself to selecting a few of the
characteristic birds of the country, for this part of its fauna is
as interesting and peculiar as the mammalia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIRDS OF PREY.</div>

<p>Among birds of prey are vultures, eagles, and ernes, all of
them widespread and well known. One of the fishing-eagles
(<i>Haliætus macei</i>) lives along the banks of the bend of the Yellow
River in the Ortous country. The golden eagle is still
trained for the chase by Mongols; Atkinson accompanied a
party on a hunt. “We had not gone far,” he says, “when
several large deer rushed past, bounding over the plain about
three hundred yards from us. In an instant the barkut was
unhooded and his shackles removed, when he sprung from his
perch and soared on high. He rose to a considerable height,
and seemed to poise for a minute, gave two or three flaps with his
wings, and swooped off in a straight line for the prey. I could
not see his wings move, but he went at a fearful rate, and all of
us after the deer; when we were about two hundred yards off,
the bird struck the deer, and it gave one bound and fell. The
barkut had struck one talon in his neck, the other into his back,
and was tearing out his liver. The Kirghis sprung from his
horse, slipped the hood over the eagle’s head and the shackles
on his legs, and easily took him off, remounting and getting
ready for another flight.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Other smaller species are trained
to capture or worry hares, foxes, and lesser game.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>
<p>The falcons which inhabit the gate-towers and trees in Peking
form a peculiar feature of the place, from their impudence
in foraging in the streets and markets, snatching things out of
the hands of people, and startling one by their responsive
screams. Much quarrelling goes on between them and the
crows and magpies for the possession of old nests as the spring
comes on. Their services as scavengers insures them a quiet
residence in their eyries on the gate-towers. Six sorts of harriers
(<i>Circus</i>), with various species of falcons, bustards, gledes,
and sparrow-hawks, are enumerated. The family of owls is
well represented, and live ones are often exposed for sale in
the markets; its native name of ‘cat-headed hawk’ (<i>mao-’rh-tao
ying</i>) suggests the likeness of the two. Out of the fifty-six
species of accipitrine birds, the hawks are much the most
numerous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SWALLOWS, THRUSHES, LARKS, ETC.</div>

<p>The great order of Passerinæ has its full share of beautiful
and peculiar representatives, and over four hundred species
have been catalogued. The night-hawks have only three
members, but the swallows count up to fifteen species. Around
Peking they gather in vast numbers, year after year, in the
gate-towers, and that whole region was early known by the
name of <i>Yen Kwoh</i>, or ‘Land of Swallows.’ The immunity
granted by the natives to this twittering, bustling inmate of
their houses has made it a synonym for domestic life; the
phrase <i>yin yen</i> (<i>lit.</i> to ‘drink swallows’) means to give a feast.
The family of king-fishers contains several most exquisitely
colored birds, and multitudes of the handsome ones, like the
turquoise king-fisher (<i>Halcyon smyrnensis</i>), are killed by the
Chinese for the sake of the plumage. Beautiful feather-work
ornaments are made from this at Canton. The hoopoe, bee-eater,
and cuckoo are not uncommon; the first goes by the
name of the <i>shan ho-shang</i>, or ‘country priest,’ from its color.
Six species of the last have been recognized, and its peculiar
habits of driving other birds from their nests has made it well
known to the people, who call it <i>ku-ku</i> for the same reason as
do the English. On the upper Yangtsz’ the short-tailed species
makes its noisy agitated flight in order to draw off attention from
its nest. The Chinese say it weeps blood as it bewails its mate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
all night long. The <i>Cucutus striatus</i> varies so greatly in different
provinces that it has much perplexed naturalists; all of
them are only summer visitants.</p>

<p>The habit of the shrike of impaling its prey on thorns and
elsewhere before devouring it has been noticed by native
writers; no less than eleven species have been observed to cross
the country in their migrations from Siberia to the Archipelago.
Of the nuthatches, tree and wall creepers, wrens, and chats,
there is a large variety, and one species of willow-wren (<i>Sylvia
borealis</i>) has been detected over the entire eastern hemisphere;
six sorts of redstarts (<i>Ruticilla</i>) are spread over the provinces.</p>

<p>Among the common song birds reared for the household, the
thrush and lark take precedence; their fondness for birds and
flowers is one of the pleasant features of Chinese national character.
A kind of grayish-yellow thrush (<i>Garrulax perspicilatus</i>),
called <i>hwa-mí</i>, or ‘painted eyebrows,’ is common about
Canton, where a well-trained bird is worth several dollars.
This genus furnishes six species, but they are not all equally
musical; another kind (<i>Suthoria webbiana</i>) is kept for its fighting
qualities, as it will die before it yields. These and other
allied birds furnish the people with much amusement, by teaching
them to catch seeds thrown into the air, jump from perches
held in the hand, and perform tricks of various kinds. A party
of gentlemen will often be seen on the outskirts of a town in
mild weather, each one holding his pet bird, and all busily engaged
in catching grasshoppers to feed them. The spectacle
thrush (<i>Leucodioptrum</i>) has its eyes surrounded by a black
circle bearing a fancied resemblance to a pair of spectacles; it
is not a very sweet songster, but a graceful, lively fellow. The
species of wagtail and lark known amount to about a score altogether,
but not all of them are equally good singers. The
southern Chinese prefer the lark which comes from Chihlí, and
large numbers are annually carried south. The shrill notes of
the field lark (<i>Alauda cælivox</i> and <i>arvensis</i>) are heard in the
shops and streets in emulous concert with other kinds&mdash;these
larks becoming at times well-nigh frantic with excitement in
their struggles for victory. The Chinese name of <i>peh-ling</i>, or
‘hundred spirits,’ given to the Mongolian lark, indicates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
reputation it has earned as an active songster; and twenty-five
dollars is not an uncommon price for a good one.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MAGPIES AND PIGEONS.</div>

<p>The tits (<i>Parus</i>) and reedlings (<i>Emberiza</i>), together with kindred
genera, are among the most common small birds, fifteen or
twenty species of each having been noticed. In the proper season
the latter are killed for market in such numbers as to excite
surprise that they do not become extinct. In taking many of
the warblers, orioles, and jays, for rearing or sale as fancy birds,
the Chinese are very expert in the use of birdlime. In all parts
of the land, the pie family are deemed so useful as scavengers
that they are never molested, and in consequence become very
common. The magpie is a favorite bird, as its name, <i>hí tsioh</i>,
or ‘joyous bird,’ indicates, and occurs all over the land. Ravens,
choughs, crows, and blackbirds keep down the insects and vermin
and consume offal. The palace grounds and inclosures of
the nobility in Peking are common resorts for these crows,
where they are safe from harm in the great trees. Every
morning myriads of them leave town with the dawn, returning
at evening with increased cawing and clamor, at times actually
darkening the sky with their flocks. A pretty sight is occasionally
seen when two or three thousand young crows assemble
just at sunset in mid-air to chase and play with each other.
The crow is regarded as somewhat of a sacred bird, either from
a service said to have been rendered by one of his race to an
ancestor of the present dynasty, or because he is an emblem of
filial duty, from a notion that the young assist their parents
when disabled. The owl, on the other hand, has an odious
name because it is stigmatized as the bird which eats its dam.
One member of the pie family deserving mention is the long-tailed
blue jay of Formosa (<i>Urocissa</i>), remarkable for its brilliant
plumage. Another, akin to the sun birds (<i>Æthopyga
dabryi</i>), comes from Sz’chuen, a recent discovery. The body is
red, the head, throat, and each side of the neck a brilliant
violet, belly yellow, wings black with the primaries tinted green
along the edge, and the feathers long, tapering, of a black or
steel blue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>Mainah</i>, or Indian mino (<i>Acridotheus</i>), known by its
yellow carbuncles, which extend like ears from behind the eye,
is reared, as are also three species of <i>Munia</i>, at Canton. Sparrows
abound in every province around houses, driving away
other birds, and entertaining the observer by their quarrels and
activity. Robins, ouzels, and tailor-birds are not abundant.
None of the humming-birds or birds of paradise occur, and
only one species has hitherto been seen of the parrot group.
Woodpeckers (<i>Picus</i>) are of a dozen species, and the wryneck
occasionally attracts the eye of a sportsman. The canary is
reared in great numbers, being known under the names of
‘white swallow’ and ‘time sparrow;’ the chattering Java
sparrow and tiny avedavat are also taught little tricks by their
fanciers, in compensation for their lack of song. The two or
three proper parrots are natives of Formosa.</p>

<p>The family of pigeons (<i>Columbidæ</i>) is abundantly represented
in fourteen species, and doves form a common household
bird; their eggs are regarded as proper food to prevent small-pox,
and sold in the markets, being also cooked in birdnest and
other kinds of soups. The Chinese regard the dove as eminently
stupid and lascivious, but grant it the qualities of faithfulness,
impartiality, and filial duty. The cock is said to send
away its mate on the approach of rain, and let her return to the
nest with fine weather. They have an idea that it undergoes
periodic metamorphoses, but disagree as to the form it takes,
though the sparrow-hawk has the preference.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The bird is
most famed, however, for its filial duty, arising very probably
from imperfect observations of the custom of feeding its young
with the macerated contents of its crop; the wood pigeon is
said to feed her seven young ones in one order in the morning,
and reversing it in the evening. Its note tells the husbandman
when to begin his labors, and the decorum observed in the nests
and cotes of all the species teach men how to govern a family
and a state. The visitor to Peking is soon attracted by the
æolian notes proceeding from doves which circle around their
homes for a short time (forty or fifty or less in a flock), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
then settle. These birds are called <i>pan-tien kiao-jin</i>, or ‘mid-sky
houris,’ and their weird music is caused by ingenious wooden
whistles tied on the rumps of two or three of the flock, which
lead the others and delight themselves. Carrier pigeons are
used to some extent, and training them is a special mystery.
One of the prettiest sort is the rose pigeon, and half a dozen
kinds of turtles enliven the village groves with their gentle
notes and peculiar plumage.</p>

<p>No tribe of birds in China, however, equals the Gallinaceous
for its beauty, size, and novelty, furnishing some of the most
elegant and graceful birds in the world, and yet none of them
have become domesticated for food. As a connecting link between
this tribe and the last is the sand-grouse of the desert
(<i>Syrrhaptis paradoxus</i>), whose singular combination attracted
Marco Polo’s eye. “This bird, the <i>barguerlac</i>, on which the
falcons feed,” says he, “is as big as a partridge, has feet like
a parrot’s, tail like a swallow’s, and is strong in flight.”<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Abbé
Huc speaks of the immense flocks which scour the plateau.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIETIES OF PHEASANTS.</div>

<p>The gold and silver pheasants are reared without trouble in
all the provinces, and have so long been identified with the
ornithology of China as to be regarded as typical of its grotesque
and brilliant fauna. Among other pheasants may be
mentioned the Impeyan, Reeves, Argus, Medallion, Amherst,
l’Huys, and Pallas, each one vieing with the other for some
peculiarly graceful feature of color and shape, so that it is hard
to decide which is the finest. The Amherst pheasant has the
bearing, the elegance, and the details of form like the gold
pheasant, but the neck, shoulders, back and wing covers are of
a sparkling metallic green, and each feather ends in a belt of velvet
black. A little red crest allies it to the gold pheasant, and a
pretty silvery ruff with a black band, a white breast and belly, and
a tail barred with brown, green, white, and red bands, complete
the picturesque dress. Hidden away in these Tibetan wilds are
other pheasants that dispute the palm for beauty, among which
four species of the eared pheasant (<i>Crossoptilon</i>) attract notice.
One is of a pure white, with a black tail curled up and spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
out like a plume, and is well called the snow pheasant. Another
is the better known Pallas pheasant, nearly as large as a
turkey, distinguished by ear-like appendages or wattles behind
the head, and a red neck above a white body, whence its native
name of <i>ho-kí</i>, or ‘fire hen.’ Another genus (<i>Lophophorus</i>) contains
some elegant kinds, of which the l’Huys pheasant is new,
and noted for a coppery-green tail bespangled with white. The
longer known Reeves pheasant is sought for by the natives for
the sake of its white and yellow-barred tail feathers, which are
used by play actors to complete a warrior’s dress; Col. Yule
proves a reference to it in Marco Polo from this part of its
plumage, which the Venetian states to be ten palms in length&mdash;not
far beyond the truth, as they have been seen seven feet
long.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> It is a long time for a bird of so much beauty to have
been unknown, from 1350 to 1808, when Mr. Thomas Beale
procured a specimen in Canton, and sent others to England in
1832; Mr. Reeves took it thither, and science has recorded it
in her annals. As New Guinea is the home of the birds of
paradise, so do the Himalayas contain most of these superb
pheasants and francolins, each tribe serving as a foil and comparison
with the Creator’s handiwork in the other.</p>

<p>The island of Formosa has furnished a second species, Swinhoe’s
pheasant, of the same genus as the silver pheasant (<i>Euplocamus</i>),
and another smaller kind (<i>Phasianus formosanus</i>); the
list is also increased by fresh acquisitions from Yunnan and
Cochinchina through Dr. Anderson. This is not, however, the
place where we may indulge in details respecting all of these
gorgeous birds; we conclude, then, with the Medallion, or
horned pheasant. It has a “beautiful membrane of resplendent
colors on the neck, which is displayed or contracted according
as the cock is more or less roused. The hues are chiefly
purple, with bright red and green spots, which vary in intensity
according to the degree of excitement.”</p>

<p>The peacock, though not a native, is reared in all parts; it
bears the name of <i>kung tsioh</i>, sometimes rendered ‘Confucius’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
bird,’ though it is more probable that the name means the great
or magnificent bird. The use of the tail feathers to designate
official rank, which probably causes a large consumption of
them, does not date previous to the present dynasty. Poultry
is reared in immense quantities, but the assortment in China
does not equal in beauty, excellence, and variety the products
of Japanese culture. The silken cock, the vane of whose plume
is so minutely divided as to resemble curly hair, is probably the
same sort with that described by some writers as having wool
like sheep. The Mongols succeed very well in rearing the tall,
Shanghai breed, and their uniform cold winter enables them to
preserve frozen flesh without much difficulty. The smaller
gallinaceous birds already described, grouse, quails, francolins,
partridges, sand-snipe, etc., amount to a score or more species,
ranging all over the Empire. The red partridge is sometimes
tamed to keep as a house bird with the fowls. The Chinese
quail (<i>Coturnix</i>) has a brown back, sprinkled with black spots
and white lines, blackish throat and chestnut breast. It is reared
for fighting in south China, and, like its bigger Gallic rival, is
soon eaten if it allows itself to be beaten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAMILY OF WADERS IN CHINA.</div>

<p>The widespread family of waders sends a few of its representatives
from Europe to China, but most of the members are
Oriental. The marshes and salt lakes of Mongolia attract
enormous numbers of migratory birds in summer to rear their
young in safety, in the midst of abundant food. Col. Prejevalsky
watched the arrival of vast flocks early in February, and
thus describes their appearance: “For days together they
sped onward, always from the W.S.W., going further east in
search of open water, and at last settling down among the open
pools; their favorite haunts were the flat mud banks overgrown
with low saline bushes. Here every day vast flocks would congregate
toward evening, crowding among the ice; the noise they
made on rising was like a hurricane, and at a distance they resembled
a thick cloud. Flocks of one, two, three, and even
five thousand, followed one another in quick succession, hardly
a minute apart. Tens and hundreds of thousands, even millions
of birds appeared at Lob-nor during the fortnight ending the
21st of February, when the flight was at its height. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
prodigious quantities of food must be necessary for such numbers!”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
Wading and web-footed birds all harmlessly mix in
these countless hosts, but hawks, eagles, and animals gather too,
to prey on them.</p>

<p>Among the noticeable waders of China, the white Manchurian
or Montigny crane is one of the finest and largest; it is
the official insignia of the highest rank of civilians. Five
species of crane (<i>Grus</i>) are recognized, and seven of plovers,
together with as many more allied genera, including an avocet,
bustard, and oyster-catcher. Curlews abound along the flat
shores of the Gulf of Pechele, and are so tame that they race
up and down with the naked children at low tide, hunting for
shell-fish; as the boy runs his arm into the ooze the curlew
pokes his long bill up to the eyes in the same hole, each of
them grasping a crab. Godwits and sandpipers enliven the
coasts with their cries, and seven species of gambets (<i>Totanus</i>)
give them the largest variety of their family group, next
to the snipes (<i>Tringa</i>), of which nine are recorded. Herons,
egrets, ibis, and night-herons occur, and none of them are discarded
for food. At Canton, a pure white egret is often exposed
for sale in the market, standing on a shelf the livelong
day, with its eyelids sewed together&mdash;a pitiable sight. Its
slender, elegant shape is imitated by artists in making bronze
candlesticks. The singular spoonbill (<i>Platalea</i>) is found in
Formosa, and the jacana in southwestern China. The latter
is described by Gould as “distinguished not less by the grace
of its form than its adaptation to the localities which nature
has allotted it. Formed for traversing the morass and lotus-covered
surface of the water, it supports itself upon the floating
weeds and leaves by the extraordinary span of the toes,
aided by the unusual lightness of the body.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Gallinules,
crakes, and rails add to this list, but the flamingo has not been
recorded.</p>

<p>In the last order, sixty-five species of web-footed birds are
enumerated by naturalists as occurring in China. The fenny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
margins of lakes and rivers, and the seacoast marshes, afford
food and shelter to flocks of water-fowl. Ten separate species
of duck are known, of which four or five are peculiar. The
whole coast from Hainan to Manchuria swarms with gulls,
terns, and grebes, while geese, swans, and mallards resort to the
inland waters and pools to rear their young. Ducks are sometimes
caught by persons who first cover their heads with a
gourd pierced with holes, and then wade into the water where
the birds are feeding; these, previously accustomed to empty
calabashes floating about on the water, allow the fowler to approach,
and are pulled under without difficulty. The wild
goose is a favorite bird with native poets. The reputation for
conjugal fidelity has made its name and that of the mandarin
duck emblems of that virtue, and a pair of one or the other
usually forms part of wedding processions. The epithet <i>mandarin</i>
is applied to this beautiful fowl, and also to a species of
orange, simply because of their excellence over other varieties
of the same genus, and not, as some writers have inferred, because
they are appropriated to officers of government.</p>

<p>The <i>yuen-yang</i>, as the Chinese call this duck, is a native of
the central provinces. It is one of the most variegated birds
known, vieing with the humming-birds and parrots in the
diversified tints of its plumage, if it does not equal them for
brilliancy. The drake is the object of admiration, his partner
being remarkably plain, but during the summer season he also
loses much of his gay vesture. Mr. Bennet tells a pleasant
story in proof of the conjugal fidelity of these birds, the incidents
of which occurred in Mr. Beale’s aviary at Macao. A
drake was stolen one night, and the duck displayed the strongest
marks of despair at her loss, retiring into a corner and refusing
all nourishment, as if determined to starve herself to death
from grief. Another drake undertook to comfort the disconsolate
widow, but she declined his attentions, and was fast becoming
a martyr to her attachment, when her mate was recovered
and restored to her. Their reunion was celebrated by
the noisiest demonstrations of joy, and the duck soon informed
her lord of the gallant proposals made to her during his absence;
in high dudgeon, he instantly attacked the luckless bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
which would have supplanted him, and so maltreated him as to
cause his death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEALE’S AVIARY.</div>

<p>The aviary here mentioned was for many years, up to 1838,
one of the principal attractions of Macao. Its owner, Mr.
Thomas Beale, had erected a wire cage on one side of his house,
having two apartments, each of them about fifty feet high, and
containing several large trees; small cages and roosts were
placed on the side of the house under shelter, and in one corner
a pool afforded bathing conveniences to the water-fowl. The
genial climate obviated the necessity of any covering, and only
those species which would agree to live quietly together were
allowed the free range of the two apartments. The great attraction
of the collection was a living bird of paradise, which, at
the period of the owner’s death, in 1840, had been in his possession
eighteen years, and enjoyed good health at that time.
The collection during one season contained nearly thirty specimens
of pheasants, and besides these splendid birds, there were
upward of one hundred and fifty others, of different sorts, some
in cages, some on perches, and others going loose in the aviary.
In one corner a large cat had a hole, where she reared her
young; her business was to guard the whole from the depredations
of rats. A magnificent peacock from Damaun, a large
assortment of macaws and cockatoos, a pair of magpies, another
of the superb crowned pigeons (<i>Goura coronata</i>), one of whom
moaned itself to death on the decease of its mate, and several
Nicobar ground pigeons, were also among the attractions of this
curious and valuable collection.</p>

<p>Four or five kinds of grebe and loon frequent the coast, of
which the <i>Podiceps cristatus</i>, called <i>shui nu</i>, or ‘water
slave,’ is common around Macao. The same region affords
sustenance to the pelican, which is seen standing motionless for
hours on the rocks, or sailing on easy wing over the shallows
in search of food. Its plumage is nearly a pure white, except
the black tips of the wings; its height is about four feet, and
the expanse of the wings more than eight feet. The bill is
flexible like whalebone, and the pouch susceptible of great
dilatation. Gulls abound on the northeast coasts, and no one
who has seen it can forget the beautiful sight on the marshes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
at the entrance of the Pei ho, where myriads of white gulls
assemble to feed, to preen, and to quarrel or scream&mdash;the
bright sun rendering their plumage like snow. The albatross,
black tern, petrel, and noddy increase the list of denizens in
Chinese waters, but offer nothing of particular interest.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<div class="caption"><p>The Kí-lin, or Unicorn.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE KÍ-LIN AND FUNG-HWANG.</div>

<p>There are four fabulous animals which are so often referred
to by the Chinese as
to demand a notice.
The <i>kí-lin</i> is one of
these and is placed
at the head of all
hairy animals; as
the <i>fung-hwang</i> is
pre-eminent among
feathered races; the
dragon and tortoise
among the scaly and
shelly tribes; and
<em>man</em> among naked
animals! The naked,
hairy, feathered,
shelly, and scaly
tribes constitute the
quinary system of
ancient Chinese naturalists.
The <i>kí-lin</i>
is pictured as resembling
a stag in its
body and a horse in its hoofs, but possessing the tail of an ox
and a parti-colored or scaly skin. A single horn having a
fleshy tip proceeds out of the forehead. Besides these external
marks to identify it, the <i>kí-lin</i> exhibits great benevolence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
disposition toward other living animals, and appears only when
wise and just kings, like Yau and Shun, or sages like Confucius,
are born, to govern and teach mankind. The Chinese description
presents many resemblances to the popular notices of the
unicorn, and the independent origin of their account adds something
to the probability that a single-horned equine or cervine
animal has once existed.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>The Fung-hwang, or Phœnix.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Cuvier expresses the opinion that Pliny’s description of the
Arabian phœnix was derived from the golden pheasant, though
others think the Egyptian plover is the original type. From his
likening it to an eagle for size, having a yellow neck with purple,
a blue tail varied with red feathers, and a richly feathered tufted
head, it is more probable that the Impeyan pheasant was Pliny’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
type. The Chinese <i>fung-hwang</i>, or phœnix, is probably based
on the Argus pheasant. It is described as adorned with every
color, and combines in its form and motions whatever is elegant
and graceful, while it possesses such a benevolent disposition
that it will not peck or injure living insects, nor tread on
growing herbs. Like the <i>kí-lin</i>, it has not been seen since the
halcyon days of Confucius, and, from the account given of it,
seems to have been entirely fabulous. The etymology of the
characters implies that it is the emperor of all birds. One
Chinese author describes it “as resembling a wild swan before
and a unicorn behind; it has the throat of a swallow, the bill
of a cock, the neck of a snake, the tail of a fish, the forehead
of a crane, the crown of a mandarin drake, the stripes of a dragon,
and the vaulted back of a tortoise. The feathers have five
colors, which are named after the five cardinal virtues, and it is
five cubits in height; the tail is graduated like Pandean pipes,
and its song resembles the music of that instrument, having
five modulations.” A beautiful ornament for a lady’s head-dress
is sometimes made in the shape of the <i>fung-hwang</i>, and
somewhat resembles a similar ornament, imitating the vulture,
worn by the ladies of ancient Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LUNG, OR DRAGON.</div>

<p>The <i>lung</i>, or dragon, is a familiar object on articles from
China. It furnishes a comparison among them for everything
terrible, imposing, and powerful; and being taken as the imperial
coat of arms, consequently imparts these ideas to his
person and state. The type of the dragon is probably the boa-constrictor
or sea-serpent, or other similar monster, though the
researches of geology have brought to light such a near counterpart
of the <i>lung</i> in the iguanadon as to tempt one to
believe that this has been the prototype. There are three
dragons, the <i>lung</i> in the sky, the <i>lí</i> in the sea, and the <i>kiao</i> in
the marshes. The first is the only <em>authentic</em> species, according
to the Chinese; it has the head of a camel, the horns of a deer,
eyes of a rabbit, ears of a cow, neck of a snake, belly of a frog,
scales of a carp, claws of a hawk, and palm of a tiger. On
each side of the mouth are whiskers, and its beard contains a
bright pearl; the breath is sometimes changed into water and
sometimes into fire, and its voice is like the jingling of copper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
pans. The dragon of the sea occasionally ascends to heaven in
water-spouts, and is the ruler of all oceanic phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> The
dragon is worshipped and feared by Chinese fishermen, and
their <i>lung-wang</i>, or ‘dragon king,’ answers to Neptune in western
mythology; perhaps the ideas of all classes toward it is a
modified relic of the widespread serpent worship of ancient
times. The Chinese suppose that elfs, demons, and other
supernatural beings often transform themselves into snakes;
and M. Julien has translated a fairy story of this sort, called
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Blanche et Bleue</cite>. The <i>kwei</i>, or tortoise, has so few fabulous
qualities attributed to it that it hardly comes into the list; it
was, according to the story, an attendant on Pwanku when he
chiselled out the world. A semi-classical work, the <cite>Shan-hai
King</cite>, or ‘Memoirs upon the Mountains and Seas,’ contains
pictures and descriptions of these and kindred monsters, from
which the people now derive strange notions respecting them,
the book having served to embody and fix for the whole nation
what the writer anciently found floating about in the popular
legends of particular localities.</p>

<p>A species of alligator (<i>A. sinensis</i>) has been described by
Dr. A. Fauvel in the <cite>N. C. Br. R. A. Soc. Journal</cite>, No. XIII.,
1879, in which he gives many historical and other notices of its
existence. Crocodiles are recorded as having been seen in the
rivers of Kwangtung and Kwangsí, but none of this family
attain a large size.</p>

<p>Marco Polo’s account of the huge serpent of Yunnan,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> having
two forelegs near the head, and one claw like that of a lion or
hawk on each, and a mouth big enough to swallow a man whole,
referring no doubt to the crocodile, is a good instance of the
way in which truth and fable were mingled in the accounts of
those times. The flesh is still eaten by the Anamese, as he
says it was in his day. A gigantic salamander, analogous to
the one found in Japan (the <i>Sieboldia</i>), has suggested it as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
type of the dragon which figures on the Chinese national flag.
Small lizards abound in the southern parts, and the variety
and numbers of serpents, both land and water, found in the
maritime provinces, are hardly exceeded in any country in the
world; they are seldom poisonous. A species of naja is the
only venomous snake yet observed at Chusan, and the hooded
cobra is one of the few yet found around Canton. Another
species frequents the banks, and is driven out of the drains and
creeks by high water into the houses. A case is mentioned by
Bennet of a Chinese who was bitten, and to whose wound the
mashed head of the reptile had been applied as a poultice, a
mode of treatment which probably accelerated his death by
mixing more of the poison diluted in the animal’s blood with
the man’s own blood. It is, however, rare to hear of casualties
from this source. This snake is called ‘black and white,’
from being marked in alternate bands of those two colors. A
species of acrochordon, remarkable for its abrupt, short tail,
has been noticed near Macao.</p>

<p>It is considered felicitous by the Buddhist priests to harbor
snakes around their temples; and though the natives do not
play with poisonous serpents like the Hindoos, they often
handle or teach them simple tricks. The common frog is taken
in great numbers for food. Tortoises and turtles from fresh
and salt water are plenty along the coast, while both the emys
and trionyx are kept in tubs in the streets, where they grow
to a large size. An enormous carnivorous tortoise inhabits the
waters of Chehkiang near the ocean. The natives have strange
ideas concerning the hairy turtle of Sz’chuen, and regard it as
excellent medicine; it is now known that the supposed hair
consists of confervæ, whose spores, lodged on the shell, have
grown far beyond the animal’s body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ICHTHYOLOGY OF CHINA.</div>

<p>The ichthyology of China is one of the richest in the world,
though it may be so more from the greater proportion of food
furnished by the waters than from any real superabundance of
the finny tribes. The offal thrown from boats near cities attracts
some kinds to those places, and gives food and employment
to multitudes. Several large collections of fishes have
been made in Canton, and Mr. Reeves deposited one of the rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>est
in the British Museum, together with a series of drawings
made by native artists from living specimens; they have been
described by Sir John Richardson in the <cite>Report of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, for 1845</cite>. In this
paper he enumerates one hundred and ninety genera and six
hundred and seventy-one species, nearly all of which are marine
or come out to sea at certain times. Since it was prepared
great accessions to this branch have been made from the inland
waters, so that probably a thousand sorts in all have been observed.
The salmon and cod families are comparatively scarce,
but the mackerel, goby, and herring families are very abundant.
The variety of fish is so great in Macao, that if one is
willing to eat all that are brought to market, as the Chinese do
(including the sharks, torpedoes, gudgeons, etc.), one can have
a different species every day in the year. It may with truth
be said that the Chinese eat nearly every living thing found in
the water, some of the hideous fishing frogs or gurnards alone
excepted.</p>

<p>The cartilaginous fishes, sharks, rays, and saw-fish, are abundant
on the sea-coast. The sturgeon is not common at the south,
but in the winter it is brought from the Songari and other
rivers to Peking for the imperial table, being highly prized by
Chinese epicures. There is found in the Yangtsz’ a singular
species of sturgeon, the <i>yiu yü</i>, which lies under the banks in still
water and sucks its prey into a sac-like mouth projecting like
a cusp under the long snout; it has no scales, and is four feet
long. Common sturgeon, weighing a thousand pounds, are
caught in this river. The hammer-headed and zebra shark
(<i>Cestracion zebra</i>) are seen in the markets at Macao; also huge
skates, some of them measuring five feet across; the young of
all these species are regarded as particularly good eating. A
kind of torpedo (<i>Narcine lingula</i>) is not uncommon on the
southern coast, but the natives do not seem to be aware of any
electrical properties. It is said that the fishermen sometimes
destroy the shark by boiling a melon and throwing it out as a
bait; when swallowed, the heat kills the fish. The true cod
has not been observed on the Chinese coast, but several species
of serrani (as <i>Plectropoma susuki</i>, <i>Serranus shihpan</i>, <i>Megachir</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
etc.), generally called <i>shih-pan</i> by the natives, and garoupa by
foreigners, are common off Canton, and considered to be most
delicate fare. Another fine fish is the <i>Polynemus tetradactylus</i>,
or bynni-carp, often called salmon by foreigners; isinglass is
prepared from its skin. The pomfret, or <i>tsang yü</i> (<i>Stromateus
argenteus</i>), is a good pan-fish, but hardly so delicate as the sole,
many fine species of which abound along the whole coast. Besides
these, two or three species of mackerel, the <i>Sciœna lucida</i>,
an ophicephalus, the mullet, and the ‘white rice fish’ occur.
The shad is abundant off the Yangtsz’, and is superior to the
American species; Chinese epicures will sometimes pay fifty
dollars for the first one of the season.</p>

<p>The carp family (<i>Cyprinidæ</i>) is very abundant in the rivers
and lakes of China, and some species are reared in fish-pools and
tubs to a monstrous size; fifty-two species are mentioned in
Richardson’s list. The gold-fish is the most celebrated, and
has been introduced into Europe, where it was first seen toward
the end of the seventeenth century. The Chinese say that its
native place is Lake Tsau, in the province of Nganhwui. The
effects of domestication in changing the natural form of this
fish are great; specimens are often seen without any dorsal fin,
and the tail and other fins tufted and lobed to such a degree as
to resemble artificial appendages or wings rather than natural
organs. The eyes are developed till the globe projects beyond
the socket like goggles, presenting an extraordinary appearance.
Some of them are so fantastic, indeed, that they would be regarded
as lusus naturæ were they not so common. The usual
color is a ruddy golden hue, but both sexes exhibit a silvery or
blackish tint at certain stages of their growth; and one variety,
called the silver-fish, retains this shade all its life. The Chinese
keep it in their garden ponds, or in earthern jars, in which
are placed rocks covered with moss, and overgrown with tufts
of ferns, to afford them a retreat from the light. When the
females spawn, the eggs must be removed to a shallow vessel,
lest the males devour them, where the heat of the sun hatches
them; the young are nearly black, but gradually become whitish
or reddish, and at last assume a golden or silvery hue.
Specimens upward of two feet long have been noticed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
those who rear them emulate each other in producing new
varieties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">METHODS OF REARING FISH.</div>

<p>The rearing of fish is an important pursuit, the spawn being
collected with the greatest care and placed in favorable positions
for hatching. The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin Universel</cite> for 1829 asserts
that in some part of China the spawn so taken is carefully
placed in an empty egg-shell and the hole closed; the egg is
then replaced in the nest, and, after the hen has sat a few days
upon it, reopened, and the spawn placed in vessels of water
warmed by the sun, where it soon hatches.</p>

<p>The immense fleets of fishing boats on the Yangtsz’ and its
tributaries indicate the finny supplies its waters afford. A species
of pipe-fish (<i>Fistularia immaculata</i>), of a red color, and
the gar-pike, with green bones, are found about Canton; as are
also numerous beautiful parrot-fish and sun-fish (<i>Chætodon</i>).
An ingenious mode of taking its prey is practised by a sort of
chætodon, or chelmon; it darts a drop of water at the flies or
other insects lighting on the bank near the edge, in such a
manner as to knock them off, when they are devoured. All
the species of ophicephalus, or <i>săng yü</i>, so remarkable for their
tenacity of life, are reared in tanks and pools, and are hawked
alive through the streets.</p>

<p>Eels, mullets, alewives or file-fish, breams, gudgeons, and
many other kinds, are seen in the markets. Few things eaten
by the Chinese look more repulsive than the gobies as they lie
wriggling in the slime which keeps them alive; one species
(<i>Trypauchen vagina</i>), called <i>chu pih yü</i>, or ‘vermilion pencil-fish,’
is a cylindrical fish, six or eight inches long, of a dark red
color; its eyes protrude so that it can see behind, like a giraffe.
Some kinds of gobies construct little hillocks in the ooze, with
a depression on the top, in which their spawn is hatched by the
sun; at low tide they skip about on the banks like young frogs,
and are easily captured with the hand. A delicious species of
Saurus (<i>Leucosoma Chinensis</i>), called <i>pih fan yü</i>, or ‘white rice
fish,’ and <i>yin yü</i>, or silver-fish, ranges from Hakodate to Canton.
It is six or eight inches long, the body scaleless and transparent,
so that the muscles, intestines, and spinal column can
be seen without dissection; the bones of the head are thin, flex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>ible,
and diaphanous. Many species of file-fish, sole-fish, anchovy,
and eels, are captured on the coast. Vast quantities of
dried fish, like the stock fish in Sweden, are sent inland to sell
in regions where fish are rare. The most common sorts are the
perch, sun-fish, gurnard, and hair-tail (<i>Trichinrus</i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHELL-FISH AND INSECTS OF CHINA.</div>

<p>Shell-fish and mollusks, both fresh and salt, are abundant in
the market. Oysters of a good quality are common along the
coast, and a species of mactra, or sand-clam, is fished up near
Macao. The Pearl River affords two or three kinds of fresh-water
shell-fish (<i>Mytilus</i>), and snails (<i>Voluta</i>) are plenty in all
pools. The crangons, prawns, shrimps, crabs, and other kinds
of crustacea met with, are not less abundant than palatable;
one species of craw-fish, as large as (but not taking the place of)
the lobster, called <i>lung hai</i>, or ‘dragon crab,’ together with
cuttle-fish of three or four kinds, and the king-crab (<i>Polyphemus</i>),
are all eaten. The inland waters produce many species
of shells, and the new genus theliderma, allied to the unio,
was formed by Mr. Benson, of Calcutta, from specimens obtained
of a shopkeeper at Canton. The land shells are abundant,
especially various kinds of snails (<i>Helix</i>, <i>Lymnea</i>, etc.);
twenty-two species of helix alone were contained in a small
collection sent from Peking, in which region all this kind of
food is well known. A catalogue of nearly sixty shells obtained
in Canton is given in Murray’s <cite>China</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> but it is doubtful
whether even half of them are found in the country, as the
shops there are supplied in a great degree from the Archipelago.
Dr. Cantor<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> mentions eighty-eight genera of shells occurring
between Canton and Chusan. Pearls are found in China, and
Marco Polo speaks of a salt lake, supposed now to be in Yunnan,
which produced them in such quantity that the fishery in
his day was farmed out and restricted lest they should become
too cheap and common. In Chehkiang the natives take a large
kind of clam (<i>Alasmodonta</i>) and gently attach leaden images<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
of Buddha under the fish, after which it is thrown back into
the water. Nacre is deposited over the lead, and after a few
months the shells are retaken, cleaned, and then sent abroad to
sell as proofs of the power and presence of Buddha. The
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite> speaks of a mode practised by the Chinese
of making pearls by dropping a string of small mother-of-pearl
beads into the shell, which in a year are covered with the
pearly crust. Leeches are much used by native physicians;
the hammer-headed leech has been noticed at Chusan.</p>

<p>The insects of China are almost unknown to the naturalist.
In Dr. Cantor’s collection, from Chusan, there are fifty-nine
genera mentioned, among which tropical forms prevail; there
are also six genera of arachnidæ, and the list of spiders could
easily be multiplied to hundreds; among them are many showing
most splendid coloring. One large and strong species is
affirmed to capture small birds on the trees. Locusts sometimes
commit extensive ravages, and no part of the land is free
from their presence, though their depredations do not usually
reach over a great extent of country, or often for two successive
years. They are, however, sufficiently troublesome to attract
the notice of the government, as the edict against them, inserted
in <a href="#EDICT_FOR_THE_DESTRUCTION_OF_GRASSHOPPERS">another chapter</a>, proves. Centipedes, scorpions, and some
other species in the same order are known, the former being
most abundant in the central and western regions, where scorpions
are rare.</p>

<p>The most valuable insect is the silkworm, which is reared in
nearly every province, and the silk from other wild worms
found on the oak and ailantus in Shantung, Sz’chuen, and elsewhere
also gathered; the proper silkworm itself has been met
with to some extent in northern Shansí and Mongolia. Many
other insects of the same order (<i>Lepidopteræ</i>) exist, but those
sent abroad have been mostly from the province of Kwangtung.
Eastward of the city of Canton, on a range of hills
called Lofau shan, large butterflies and night moths of immense
size and brilliant coloring are captured. One of these
insects (<i>Bombyx atlas</i>) measures about nine inches across; the
ground color is a rich and varied orange brown, and in the centre
of each wing there is a triangular transparent spot, resem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>bling
a piece of mica. Sphinxes of great beauty and size are
common, and in their splendid coloring, rapid noiseless flight
from flower to flower, at the close of the day, remind one of the
humming-bird. Some families are more abundant than others;
the coleopterous exceed the lepidopterous, and the range of particular
tribes in each of these is often very limited. The humid
regions of Sz’chuen furnished a great harvest of beautiful butterflies
to M. David, while the lamellicorn beetles and cerambycidæ
are the most common in the north and central parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLEOPTERÆ AND THE WAX WORM.</div>

<p>Many tribes of coleopterous insects are abundant, but the
number of species yet identified is trifling. Several water
beetles, and others included under the same general designation,
have been found in collections sold at Canton, but owing to the
careless manner in which those boxes are filled, very few specimens
are perfect, the antennæ or tarsi being broken. The mole-cricket
occurs everywhere. The common cricket is caught and
sold in the markets for gambling; persons of all ranks amuse
themselves by irritating two of these insects in a bowl, and betting
upon the prowess of their favorites. The cicada, or broad
locust, is abundant, and its stridulous sound is heard from trees
and groves with deafening loudness. Boys tie a straw around
the abdomen of the male, so as to irritate the sounding apparatus,
and carry it through the streets in this predicament, to
the great annoyance of every one. This insect was well known
to the Greeks; the ancient <span class="lock">distich&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“Happy the cicadas’ lives,</div>
      <div class="verse">For they all have voiceless wives,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>hints at their knowledge of this sexual difference, as well as intimates
their opinion of domestic quiet. Again it forms the
subject of Meleager’s invocation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“O shrill-voiced insect! that with dew-drops meet,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Inebriate, dost in desert woodlands sing;</div>

      <div class="verse indent2">Thy dusky body’s echoings harp-like ring.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The lantern-fly (<i>Fulgora</i>) is less common than the cicada. It is
easily recognized by its long cylindrical snout, arched in an up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>ward
direction, its greenish reticulated elytra, and orange-yellow
wings with black extremities; but its appearance in the evening
is far from being as luminous as are the fire-fly and glow-worm
of South America. The <i>Peh lah shu</i>, or ‘white wax tree’ (<i>Fraxinus
chinensis</i>), affords nourishment to an insect of this order
called <i>Coccus pela</i>. The larvæ alone furnish the wax, the secretion
being the result of disease. Sir Geo. L. Staunton first
described the fly from specimens seen in Annam in 1795, where
the natives collected a white powder from the bark of the
tree on which it occurs. Daniel Hanbury figured the insect
and tree with the deposit of crude wax on the limbs, all obtained
in Chekhiang province.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Baron Richthofen speaks of
this industry in Sz’chuen as one furnishing employment to
great multitudes. The department of Kia-ting furnishes the
best wax, as its climate is warmer than Chingtu. The eggs of
the insect are gathered in Kien-chang and Ning-yuen, where
the tree flourishes on which it deposits them, and its culture is
carefully attended to. The insect lives and breeds on this evergreen,
and in April the eggs are collected and carried up to
Kia-ting by porters. This journey is mostly performed by
night so as to avoid the risk of hatching their loads; 300 eggs
weigh one tael. They are instantly placed on the same kind of
tree, six or seven balls of eggs done up in palm-leaf bags and
hung on the twigs. In a few days the larvæ begin to spread
over the branches, but do not touch the leaves; the bark soon
becomes incrusted with a white powder, and is not disturbed
till August. The loaded branches are then cut off and boiled,
when the wax collects on the surface of the water, is skimmed
off, and melted again to be poured into pans for sale. A tael’s
weight of eggs will produce two or three catties of the translucent,
highly crystalline wax; it sells there for five mace a tael and
upward. The annual income is reckoned at Tls. 2,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
The purposes to which this singular product are applied include
all those of beeswax. Pills are ingeniously enclosed in small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
globes of it, and candles of every size made. Wax is also gathered
from wild and domestic bees, but honey is not much used;
a casing of wax, colored with vermilion, is used to inclose the
tallow of great painted candles set before the idols and tablets.</p>

<p>The <cite>Chinese Herbal</cite> contains a singular notion, prevalent
also in India, concerning the generation of the sphex, or solitary
wasp. When the female lays her eggs in the clayey nidus
she makes in houses, she encloses the dead body of a caterpillar
in it for the subsistence of the worms when they hatch. Those
who observed her entombing the caterpillar did not look for
the eggs, and immediately concluded that the sphex took the
worm for her progeny, and say that as she plastered up the
hole of the nest, she hummed a constant song over it, saying,
“<i>Class with me! Class with me!</i>”&mdash;and the transformation
gradually took place, and was perfected in its silent grave by
the next spring, when a winged wasp emerged to continue its
posterity in the same mysterious way.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>White ants are troublesome in the warmer parts, and annoy
the people there by eating up the coffins in the graves. They
form passages under ground, and penetrate upward into the
woodwork of houses, and the whole building may become infested
with them almost before their existence is suspected.
They will even eat their way into fruit trees, cabbages, and
other plants, destroying them while in full vigor. Many of the
internal arrangements of the nests of bees and ants, and their
peculiar instincts, have been described by Chinese writers with
considerable accuracy. The composition of the characters for
the bee, ant, and mosquito, respectively, denote the <i>awl</i> insect,
the <i>righteous</i> insect, and the <i>lettered</i> insect; referring thereby
to the sting of the first, the orderly working and subordination
of the second, and the letter-like markings on the wings of
the latter. Mosquitoes are plenty, and gauze curtains are considered
to be a more necessary part of bed furniture than a
mattress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESEARCHES IN THE BOTANY OF CHINA.</div>

<p>The botany of China is rather better known than its zoölogy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
though vast and unexplored fields, like that reaching from Canton
to Silhet and Assam, still invite the diligent collector to
gather, examine, and make known their treasures. One of the
earliest authors in this branch was Père Loureiro, a Portuguese
for thirty-six years missionary in Cochinchina, and professor of
mathematics and physic in the royal palace. He gathered a
large herbarium there and in southern Kwangtung, and published
his <i>Flora Cochinchinensis</i> in 1790, in which he described
one hundred and eighty-four genera and more than three hundred
new species. The only other work specially devoted to
Chinese botany is Bentham’s <cite>Flora Hongkongensis</cite>, published
in 1861. The materials for it were collected by Drs. Hinds,
Hance and Harland, Col. Champion, and others, during the
previous twenty years, and amounted in all to upward of five
thousand specimens, gathered exclusively on the island. Since
its publication, Dr. Hance has added to our accurate knowledge
of the Chinese flora many new specimens growing in other
parts of the Empire, whose descriptions are scattered through
various publications. Père David, during his extensive travels
in northern China, gathered thousands of specimens which have
yet to be carefully described. The Russian naturalists Maximowitch,
Bunge, Tatarinov, Bretschneider, Prejevalsky, and
others have largely increased our knowledge of the plants of
Mongolia, the Amur basin, and the region about Peking. The
first named has issued a separate work on the Amur flora, but
most of the papers of these scientists are to be found in periodicals.
In very early days, China was celebrated for the camphor,
varnish, tallow, oil, tea, cassia, dyes, etc., obtained from
its plants; and the later monographs of professed botanists,
issued since Linneus looked over the two hundred and sixty-four
species brought by his pupil Osbeck in 1750, down to the
present day, have altogether given immense assistance to a
thorough understanding of their nature and value.</p>

<p>Mr. Bentham’s observations on the range of the plants collected
in the island of Hongkong represent its flora, in general
character, as most like that of tropical Asia, of which it offers,
in numerous instances, the northern limit. The damp, wooded
ravines on the north and west furnish plants closely allied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
those of Assam and Sikkim; while other species, in considerable
numbers, have a much more tropical character, extending
with little variation over the Archipelago, Malaysia, Ceylon,
and even to tropical Africa, but not into India. Within two
degrees north of the island these tropical features (so far as is
known) almost entirely cease, and out of the one thousand and
fifty-six species described in the <cite>Flora Hongkongensis</cite>, only
about eighty have been found in Japan; thus indicating that
very few of the plants known to range across from the Himalaya
to Japan grow south of Amoy. On the twenty-nine
square miles forming the area of Hongkong there exists, Mr.
Bentham says, a greater number of monotypic genera than in
any other flora from an equal area in the world; he gives a
comparative table of the floras of Hongkong, Aden and Ischia
islands, about equal in extent, showing one thousand and three
species growing on the first, ninety-five on the second, and
seven hundred and ninety-two on the third. The proportion
of woody to herbaceous species in Hongkong is nearly one-half,
while in Ischia it is one to eleven; yet Hongkong has actually
fewer trees than Ischia. Out of the one thousand and three
species of wild plants there, three hundred and ninety-eight
also occur in the tropical Asiatic flora, while one hundred and
eighty-seven others have been found as well on the mainland;
one hundred and fifty-nine are peculiar to the island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONIFERÆ AND GRASSES.</div>

<p>Many species of coniferæ are floated down to Canton, taken
from the Mei ling, or brought from Kwangsí; the timber is
used for fuel, but more for rafters and pillars in buildings.
The wood of the pride of India is employed for cabinet work;
there are also many kinds of fancy wood, some of which are
imported, and more are indigenous. The <i>nan muh</i>, or southern
wood, a magnificent species of laurus common in Sz’chuen,
which resists time and insects, is peculiarly valuable, and reserved
for imperial use. The cœsalpinia, rose wood, aigle
wood, and the camphor, elm, willow, and aspen, are also
serviceable in carpentry.</p>

<p>The people collect seaweed to a great extent, using it in the
arts and also for food; among these the <i>Gigartina tenax</i> affords
an excellent material for glues and varnishes. It is boiled, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
the transparent glue obtained is brushed upon very coarse silk or
mulberry paper, filling up their substance, and making a transparent
covering for lanterns; it is also used as a size for stiffening
silks and gauze. This and other kinds of fuci are boiled to a
jelly and used for food; it is known in commerce under the name
of agar-agar. The thick fronds of the laminaria are gathered on
the northern coasts and imported from Japan. Among other
cryptogams, the Tartarian lamb (<i>Aspidium barometz</i>), so
graphically described by Darwin in his <cite>Botanic Garden</cite>, has
long been celebrated; it is partly an artificial production of the
ingenuity of Chinese gardeners taking advantage of the natural
habits of the plant to form it into a shape resembling a sheep or
other object.</p>

<p>Among remarkable grasses the zak or saxaul (<i>Haloxylon</i>) and
the <i>sulhir</i> (<i>Agriophyllum</i>), which grow in the sandy parts of
the desert of Gobi, should be mentioned. The first is found
across the whole length of this arid region, growing on the bare
sand, furnishing to the traveller a dry and ready fuel in its brittle
twigs, while his camels greedily browse on its leafless but
juicy and prickly branches. The Mongols pitch their tents beneath
its shelter, seeking for some covert from the wintry
winds, and encouraged to dig at its roots for water which has
been detained by their succulent nature, a wonderful provision
furnished by God in the bleakest desert. The <i>sulhir</i> is even
more important, and is the “gift of the desert.” It grows on
bare sand, is about two feet high, a prickly saline plant, producing
many seeds in September, of a nutritious, agreeable
nature, food for man and beast.</p>

<p>The list of gramineous plants cultivated for food is large;
the common sorts include rice, wheat, barley, oats, maize, sugar-cane,
panic, sorghum, spiked and panicled millet, of each kind
several varieties. The grass (<i>Phragmites</i>) raised along the
river banks is carefully cut and dried, to be woven into floor-matting;
a coarser sort, called <i>atap</i>, is made of bamboo splints
for roofs of huts, awnings, and sheds. In the milder climes of
the southern coasts, cheap houses are constructed of these
materials. The coarse grass and shrubbery on the hills is cut
in the autumn for fuel by the poor; and when the hills are well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
sheared of their grassy covering, the stubble is set on fire, in
order to supply ashes for manuring the next crop&mdash;an operation
which tends to keep the hills bare of all shrubbery and
trees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BAMBOO&mdash;ITS BEAUTY AND USEFULNESS.</div>

<p>Few persons who have not seen the bamboo growing in its
native climes get a full idea from pictures of its grace and
beauty. A clump of this magnificent grass will gradually develop
by new shoots into a grove, if care be taken to cut down
the older stems as they reach full maturity, and not let them
flower and go to seed; for as soon as they have perfected the
seed, they die down to the root, like other grasses. The stalks
usually attain the height of fifty feet, and in the Indian islands
often reach seventy feet and upward, with a diameter of ten or
twelve inches at the bottom. A road lined with them, with
their feathery sprays meeting overhead, presents one of the most
beautiful avenues possible to a warm climate.</p>

<p>In China the industry and skill of the people have multiplied
and perpetuated a number of varieties (one author contents
himself with describing sixty of them), among which are the
yellow, the black, the green, the slender sort for pipes, and a
slenderer one for writing-pencils, the big-leaved, etc. Its uses
are so various that it is not easy to enumerate them all. The
shoots come out of the ground nearly full-sized, four to six
inches in diameter, and are cut like asparagus to eat as a pickle
or a comfit, or by boiling or stewing. Sedentary Buddhist
priests raise this lenten fare for themselves or to sell, and extract
the tabasheer from the joints of the old culms, to sell as a
precious medicine for almost anything which ails you. The
roots are carved into fantastic and ingenious images and stands,
or divided into egg-shaped divining-blocks to ascertain the will
of the gods, or trimmed into lantern handles, canes, and umbrella-sticks.</p>

<p>The tapering culms are used for all purposes that poles can
be applied to in carrying, propelling, supporting, and measuring,
for which their light, elastic, tubular structure, guarded by
a coating of silicious skin, and strengthened by a thick septum
at each joint, most admirably fits them. The pillars and props
of houses, the framework of awnings, the ribs of mat-sails, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the shafts of rakes are each furnished by these culms. So,
also, are fences and all kinds of frames, coops, and cages, the
wattles of abatis, and the ribs of umbrellas and fans. The
leaves are sewed into rain-cloaks for farmers and sailors, and
thatches for covering their huts and boats, pinned into linings
for tea-boxes, plaited into immense umbrellas to screen the
huckster and his stall from the sun and rain, or into coverings
for theatres and sheds. Even the whole lot where a two-story
house is building is usually covered in by a framework of bamboo-poles
and <i>attap</i>&mdash;as this leaf covering is called, from its
Malay name&mdash;all tied together by rattan, and protecting the
workmen and their work from sun and rain.</p>

<p>The wood, cut into splints of proper sizes and forms, is woven
into baskets of every shape and fancy, sewed into window-curtains
and door-screens, plaited into awnings and coverings for
tea-chests or sugar-cones, and twisted into cables. The shavings
and curled threads aid softer things in stuffing pillows; while
other parts supply the bed for sleeping, the chopsticks for eating,
the pipe for smoking, and the broom for sweeping. The
mattress to lie upon, the chair to sit upon, the table to eat on,
the food to eat, and the fuel to cook it with, are also derivable
from bamboo. The master makes his ferule from it, the carpenter
his foot-measure, the farmer his water-pipes, irrigating
wheels, and straw-rakes, the grocer his gill and pint cups, and
the mandarin his dreaded instrument of punishment. This last
use is so common that the name of the plant itself has come in
our language to denote this application, and the poor wretch
who is <i>bambooed</i> for his crimes is thus taught that laws cannot
be violated with impunity.</p>

<p>The paper to write on, the book to study from, the pencil to
write with, the cup to hold the pencils, and the covering of the
lattice-window instead of glass are all indebted to this grass in
their manufacture. The shaft of the soldier’s spear, and oftentimes
the spear altogether, the plectrum for playing the lute,
the reed in the native organ, the skewer to fasten the hair, the
undershirt to protect the body, the hat to screen the head, the
bucket to draw the water, and the easy-chair to lounge on,
besides cages for birds, fish, bees, grasshoppers, shrimps, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
cockroaches, crab-nets, fishing-poles, sumpitans or shooting-tubes,
flutes, fifes, fire-holders, etc., etc., are among the things
furnished from this plant, whose beauty when growing is commensurate
to its usefulness when cut down. A score or two of
bamboo-poles for joists and rafters, fifty fathoms of rattan ropes,
with plenty of palm-leaves and bamboo-matting for roof and
sides, supply material for a common dwelling in the south of
China. Its cost is about five dollars. Those houses built over
creeks, or along the low banks of rivers and sea-beaches, are
elevated a few feet, and their floors are neatly made of split
bamboos, which allow the water to be seen through. The
decks, masts, yards, and framework of the mat-sails of the small
boats of the islanders in the Archipelago are all more or less
made of this useful plant. Throughout the south of Asia it
enters into the daily life of the people in their domestic economy
more than anything else, or than any other one thing does in
any part of the world. The Japanese supply us with fans
neatly formed, ribs and handle, from a single branch of bamboo,
and covered with paper made from mulberry bark, while their
skill is shown also in the exquisite covering of fine bamboo
threads woven around cups and saucers.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PALMS, YAMS, PLANTAINS, ETC.</div>

<p>In ancient times the date palm was cultivated in China, but
is now unknown. The cocoanut flourishes in Hainan and the
adjacent coasts, where its fruit, leaves, and timber are much
used. A great variety of utensils are carved from the nut-case,
and ropes spun from the coir, while the cultivators drink the
toddy made from the juice. The fan palm (<i>Chamærops</i>) is the
common palm of the country, two species being cultivated for
the wiry fibres in the leaf-sheaths, and for their broad leaves.
This fibre is far more useful than that from cocoanut husks, as
it is longer and smoother, and is woven into ropes, mats, cloaks,
and brushes. The tree is spread over the greater part of the
provinces, one of their most ornamental and useful trees. Another
sort (<i>Caryota</i>) also furnishes a fibre employed in the same
way, but its timber is more valuable; sedan thills are made of
its wood. Still another is the talipot palm (<i>Borassus</i>), from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
whose leaves a material for writing books upon was once produced,
as is the case now in Siam.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Several species of Aroideæ are cultivated, among which the
<i>Caladium cuculatum</i>, <i>Arum esculentum</i>, and <i>Indicum</i> are
common. The tuberous farinaceous roots of the <i>Sagittaria
sinensis</i> are esteemed; the roots of these plants, and of the
water-chestnut, are manufactured into a powder resembling
arrow-root. The sweet flag (<i>Calamus</i>) is used in medicine for
its spicy warmth. The stems of a species of Juncus are collected
and the pith carefully taken out and dried for the wicks
of water-lamps, and the inner layers of the pith hats so generally
worn in southern China.</p>

<p>The extensive group of lillies contains many splendid ornaments
of the conservatory and garden, natives of China; some
are articles of food. The <i>Agapanthus</i>, or blue African lily, four
species of <i>Hemerocallis</i>, or day lily, and the fragrant tuberose,
are all common about Canton; the latter is widely cultivated
for its blossoms to scent fancy teas. Eight or ten species of
Lilium (among which the speckled tiger lily and the unsullied
white are conspicuous) also add their gay beauties to the gardens;
while the modest Commelina, with its delicate blue blossoms,
ornaments the hedges and walks. Many alliaceous plants,
the onion, cives, garlic, etc., belong to this group; and the Chinese
relish them for the table as much as they admire the
flowers of their beauteous and fragrant congeners for bouquets.
The singular red-leaved iron-wood (<i>Dracæna</i>) forms a common
ornament of gardens.</p>

<p>The yam, or <i>ta-shu</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, ‘great tuber’), is not much raised,
though its wholesome qualities as an article of food are well
understood. The same group (<i>Musales</i>) to which the yam
belongs furnishes the custard-apple, one of the few fruits which
have been introduced from abroad. The Amaryllidæ are represented
by many pretty species of Crinum, Nerine, and Amaryllis.
Their unprofitable beauty is compensated by the plain but
useful plantain, said to stand before the potato and sago palm
as producing the greatest amount of wholesome food, in propor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>tion
to its size, of any cultivated plant.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> There are many varieties
of this fruit, some of them so acid as to require cooking
before eating.</p>

<p>That pleasant stomachic, ginger, is cultivated through all the
country, and exposed for sale as a green vegetable, to spice
dishes, and largely made into a preserve. The Alpinia and
Canna, or Indian shot, are common garden flowers. The large
group of Orchideæ has nineteen genera known to be natives of
China, among which the air plants (<i>Vanda</i> and <i>Ærides</i>) are great
favorites. They are suspended in baskets under the trees, and
continue to unfold their blossoms in gradual succession for many
weeks, all the care necessary being to sprinkle them daily. The
true species of Ærides are among the most beautiful productions
of the vegetable world, their flowers being arrayed in long racemes
of delicate colors and delicious fragrance. The beautiful Bletia,
Arundina, Spathoglottis, and Cymbidium are common in damp
and elevated places about the islands near Macao and Hongkong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOREST TREES, HEMP, ETC.</div>

<p>Many species of the pine, cypress, and yew, forming the
three subdivisions of cone-bearing plants, furnish a large proportion
of the timber and fuel. The larch is not rare, and the
<i>Pinus massoniana</i> and <i>Cunninghamia</i> furnish most of the
common pine timber. The finest member of this order in
China is the white pine (<i>Pinus bungiana</i>), peculiar to Chihlí;
its trunk is a clear white, and as it annually sheds the bark it
always looks as if whitewashed. Some specimens near Peking
are said to be a thousand years old. Two members of the
genus <i>Sequoia</i>, of a moderate size, occur near Tibet. The juniper
and thuja are often selected by gardeners to try their skill
in forcing them to grow into rude representations of birds and
animals, the price of these curiosities being proportioned to
their grotesqueness and difficulty. The nuts of the maiden-hair
tree (<i>Salisburia adiantifolia</i>) are eaten, and the leaves are
sometimes put into books as a preservative against insects.</p>

<p>The willow is a favorite plant and grows to a great size,
Staunton mentioning some which were fifteen feet in girth;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
they shade the roads near the capital, and one of them is the
true Babylonian willow; the trees are grown for timber and for
burning into charcoal. Their leaves, shape, and habits afford
many metaphors to poets and writers, much more use being
made of the tree in this way, it might almost be said, than any
other. The oak is less patronized by fine writers, but the value
of its wood and bark is well understood; the country affords
several species, one of which, the chestnut oak, is cultivated for
the cupules, to be used in dyeing. The galls are used for dyeing
and in medicine, and the acorns of some kinds are ground in
mills, and the flour soaked in water and made into a farinaceous
paste. Some of the missionaries speak of oaks a hundred feet
high, but such giants in this family are rare. “One of the
largest and most interesting of these trees, which,” writes Abel,
“I have called <i>Quercus densifolia</i>, resembled a laurel in its
shining green foliage. It bore branches and leaves in a thick
head, crowning a naked and straight stem; its fruit grew along upright
spikes terminating the branches. Another species, growing
to the height of fifty feet, bore them in long, pendulous spikes.”</p>

<p>The chestnut, walnut, and hazelnut together furnish a large
supply of food. The queer-shaped ovens fashioned in imitation
of a raging lion, in which chestnuts are roasted in the streets of
Peking, attract the eye of the visitor. The Jack-fruit (<i>Artocarpus</i>)
is not unknown in Canton, but it is not much used. There
are many species of the banian, but none of them produce fruit
worth plucking; the Portuguese have introduced the common
fig, but it does not flourish. The bastard banian is a magnificent
shade tree, its branches sometimes overspreading an area a
hundred or more feet across. The walls of cities and dwellings
are soon covered with the <i>Ficus repens</i>, and if left unmolested
its roots gradually demolish them. The paper mulberry
(<i>Broussonetia</i>) is largely cultivated in the northern provinces,
and serves the poor with their chief material for windows.
The leaf of the common mulberry is the principal object of its
culture, but the fruit is eaten and the wood burned for lampblack
to make India-ink.</p>

<p>Hemp (<i>Cannabis</i>) is cultivated for its fibres, and the seeds
furnish an oil used for household purposes and medicinal prep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>arations;
the intoxicating substance called <i>bang</i>, made in India,
is unknown in China. The family Proteaceæ contains the
<i>Eleococca cordata</i>, or <i>wu-tung</i>, a favorite tree of the Chinese for
its beauty, the hard wood it furnishes, and the oil extracted
from its seeds. The <i>Stillingia</i> belongs to the same family; this
symmetrical tree is a native of all the eastern provinces, where
it is raised for its tallow; it resembles the aspen in the form
and color of the leaf and in its general contour. The castor-oil
is cultivated as a hedge plant, and the seeds are used both in
the kitchen and apothecaries’ shop.</p>

<p>The order Hippurinæ furnishes the water caltrops (<i>Trapa</i>),
the seeds of which are vended in the streets as a fruit after
boiling; one native name is ‘buffalo-head fruit,’ which the unopened
nuts strikingly resemble. Black pepper is imported,
not so much as a spice as for its infusion, to be administered in
fevers. The betel pepper is cultivated for its leaves, which are
chewed with the betel-nut. The pitcher plant (<i>Nepenthes</i>),
called pig-basket plant, is not unfrequent near Canton; the
leaves, or ascidia, bear no small resemblance to the open baskets
employed for carrying hogs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RHUBARB, LEGUMINOSÆ, ETC.</div>

<p>Many species of the tribe <i>Rumicinæ</i> are cultivated as esculent
vegetables, among which may be enumerated spinach, green
basil, beet, amaranthus, cockscomb, broom-weed (<i>Kochia</i>), buckwheat,
etc. Two species of Polygonum are raised for the blue
dye furnished by the leaves, which is extracted, like indigo, by
maceration. Buckwheat is prepared for food by boiling it like
millet; one native name means ‘triangular wheat.’ The flour
is also employed in pastry. The cockscomb is much admired
by the Chinese, whose gardens furnish several splendid varieties.
The rhubarb is a member of this useful tribe, and large quantities
are brought from Kansuh and Koko-nor, where its habits
have lately been observed by Prejevalsky. The root is dug by
Chinese and Tanguts during September and October, dried in
the shade, and transported by the Yellow River to the coast
towns, where Europeans pay from six to ten times its rate
among the mountain markets.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The Chinese consider the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
of the world dependent on them for tea and rhubarb, whose
inhabitants are therefore forced to resort thither to procure
means to relieve themselves of an otherwise irremediable costiveness.
This argument was made use of by Commissioner
Lin in 1840, when recommending certain restrictive regulations
to be imposed upon foreign trade, because he supposed merchants
from abroad would be compelled to purchase them at
any price.</p>

<p>The order <i>Ilicinæ</i>, or holly, furnishes several genera of
Rhamneæ, whose fruits are often seen on tables. The Zizyphus
furnishes the so-called Chinese dates<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> in immense quantities
throughout the northern provinces. The fleshy peduncles
of the Hovenia are eaten; they are common in the southeastern
provinces. The leaves of the <i>Rhamnus theezans</i> are among
the many plants collected by the poor as a make-shift for the
true tea. The fruit called the Chinese olive, obtained from the
Pimela, is totally different from and is a poor substitute for the
rich olive of the Mediterranean countries.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The Leguminosæ hold an important place in Chinese botany,
affording many esculent vegetables and valuable products.
Peas and beans are probably eaten more in China than any
other country, and soy is prepared chiefly from the Soja or
Dolichos. One of the modes of making this condiment is to
skin the beans and grind them to flour, which is mixed with
water and powdered gypsum, or turmeric. It is eaten as a
jelly or curd, or in cakes, and a meal is seldom spread without
it in some form. One genus of this tribe affords indigo, and
from the buds and leaves of a species of Colutea a kind of green
dye is said to be obtained. Liquorice is esteemed in medicine;
and the red seeds of the <i>Abrus precatorius</i> are gathered for
ornaments. The Poinciana and Bauhinia are cultivated for
their flowers, and the Erythrina and Cassia are among the
most magnificent flowering trees in the south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">FRUIT TREES AND FLOWERING PLANTS.</div>

<p>The fruits are, on the whole, inferior in flavor and size to
those of the same names at the west. Several varieties of
pears, plums, peaches, and apricots are known; it is probable
that China is the native country of each of these fruits, and
some of the varieties equal those found anywhere. Erman<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
mentions an apple or haw which grows in “long bunches and
is round, about the size of a cherry, of a red color, and very
sweet taste,” found in abundance near Kiakhta. There are
numerous species of Amygdalus cultivated for their flowers;
and at new year the budding stems of the flowering almond,
narcissus, plum, peach, and bell-flower (<i>Enkianthus reticulatus</i>)
are forced into blossom for exhibition, as indicating good luck
the coming year. The apples and quinces are generally destitute
of that flavor looked for in them elsewhere, but the <i>lu-kuh</i>,
or <i>loquat</i>, is a pleasant acid spring fruit. The pomegranate is
chiefly cultivated for its beauty as a flowering plant; but the
guava and Eugenia, or rose-apple, are sold in the market or
made into jellies. The rose is a favorite among the Chinese and
extensively cultivated; twenty species are mentioned, together
with many varieties, as natives of the country; the Banks rose
is developed and trained with great skill. The Spiræa or privet,
myrtle, Quisqualis, Lawsonia or henna, white, purple, and red
varieties of crape-myrtle or Lagerstrœmia, Hydrangea, the passion-flower,
and the house-leek are also among the ornamental
plants found in gardens. Few trees in any country present a
more elegant appearance, when in full flower, than the Lagerstrœmias.
The Pride of India and Chinese tamarix are also
beautiful flowering trees. Specimens of the Cactus and Cereus,
containing fifty or more splendid flowers in full bloom, are not
unusual at Macao in August.</p>

<p>The watermelon, cucumber, squash, tomato, brinjal or egg-plant,
and other garden vegetables are abundant; the tallow-gourd
(<i>Benincasa cerifera</i>) is remarkable for having its surface
covered with a waxy exudation which smells like rosin. The
dried bottle-gourd (<i>Cucurbita lagenaria</i>) is tied to the backs of
children on the boats to assist them in floating if they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
unluckily fall overboard. The fruit and leaves of the papaw,
or <i>muh kwa</i>, ‘tree melon,’ are eaten after being cooked; the
Chinese are aware of the intenerating property of the exhalations
from the leaves of this tree, and make use of them sometimes
to soften the flesh of ancient hens and cocks, by hanging
the newly killed birds in the tree or by feeding them upon the
fruit beforehand. The carambola (<i>Averrhoa</i>) or tree gooseberry
is much eaten by the Chinese, but is not relished by
foreigners; the tree itself is also an ornament to any pleasure
grounds.</p>

<p>Ginseng is found wild in the forests of Manchuria, where it
is collected by detachments of soldiers detailed for this purpose;
these regions are regarded as imperial preserves, and the medicine
is held as a governmental monopoly. The importation of
the American root does not interfere to a very serious degree
with the imperial sales, as the Chinese are fully convinced that
their own plant is far superior. Among numerous plants of
the malvaceous and pink tribes (<i>Dianthaceæ</i>) remarkable for
their beauty or use, the <i>Lychnis coronata</i>, five sorts of pink,
the <i>Althæa Chinensis</i>, eight species of Hibiscus, and other
malvaceous flowers may be mentioned; the cotton tree (<i>Salmalia</i>)
is common at Canton; the fleshy petals are sometimes
prepared as food, and the silky stamens dried to stuff cushions.
The <i>Gossypium herbaceum</i> and <i>Pachyrrhizus</i> afford the materials
for cotton and grasscloth; both of them are cultivated in
most parts of China. The latter is a twining, leguminous
plant, cultivated from remote antiquity, and still grown for its
fibres, which are woven into linen. The petals of the <i>Hibiscus
rosa-sinensis</i> furnish a black liquid to dye the eyebrows, and at
Batavia they are employed to polish shoes. The fruits of the
<i>Hibiscus ochra</i>, or okers, are prepared for the table in a variety
of ways.</p>

<p>The <i>Camellia Japonica</i> is allied to the same great tribe as
the Hibiscus, and its elegant flowers are as much admired by
the people of its native country as by florists abroad; thirty or
forty varieties are enumerated, many of them unknown out of
China, while Chinese gardeners are likewise ignorant of a large
proportion of those found in our conservatories. This flower is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
cultivated solely for its beauty, but other species of Camellia
are raised for their seeds, the oil expressed from them being
serviceable for many household and mechanical purposes. From
the fibres of a species of Waltheria, a plant of the same tribe, a
fine cloth is made; and the <i>Pentapetes Phœnicia</i>, or ‘noon
flower,’ is a common ornament of gardens.</p>

<p>The widely diffused tribe Ranunculiaceæ has many representatives,
some of them profitable for their timber, others sought
after for their fruit or admired for their beauty, and a few
prized for their healing properties. There are eight species of
Magnolia, all of them splendid flowering plants; the bark of
the <i>Magnolia yulan</i> is employed as a febrifuge. The seed vessels
of the <i>Ilicium anisatum</i>, or star-aniseed, are gathered on
account of their spicy warmth and fragrance. The <i>Artabotrys
odoratissimus</i> and <i>Unona odorata</i> are cultivated for their perfume.
Another favorite is the <i>mowtan</i>, or tree pæony, reared
for its large and variegated flowers; its name of <i>hwa wang</i>, or
‘king of flowers,’ indicates the estimation in which it is held.
The skill of native gardeners has made many varieties, and
their patience is rewarded by the high prices which fine specimens
command. Good imitations of full-grown plants in flower
are sometimes made of pith paper. The Clematis, the foxglove,
the <i>Berberis Chinensis</i>, and the magnificent lotus, all
belong to this tribe; the latter, one of the most celebrated
plants in Asia, is more esteemed by the Chinese for its edible
roots than reverenced for its religious associations. The <i>Actæa
aspera</i> is sometimes collected, as is the scouring rush, for cleaning
pewter vessels, for which its hispid leaves are well fitted.</p>

<p>The groups which include the poppy, mustard, cabbage, cress,
and many ornamental species, form an important portion of
native agriculture. The poppy has become a common crop in
all the provinces, driving out the useful cereals by its greater
value and profit. The leaves of many cruciferous plants are
eaten, whether cultivated or wild; and one kind (<i>Isates</i>) yields
a fine blue dye in the eastern provinces; the variety and amount
of such food consumed by the Chinese probably exceeds that
of any other people. Another tribe, Rutaceæ, contains the
oranges and shaddocks, and some very fragrant shrubs, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
<i>Murraya exotica</i> and <i>paniculata</i>, and the <i>Aglaia odorata</i>;
while the bladder-tree (<i>Koelreuteria</i>) is a great attraction when
its whole surface is brilliant with golden flowers. The <i>whampe</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, yellow skin (<i>Cookia punctata</i>), is a common and superior
fruit. The seeds of the Gleditschia, besides their value in cleansing,
are worn as beads, “because,” say the Buddhists, “all
demons are afraid of the wood;” one name means ‘preventive
of evil.’ Two native fruits, the <i>líchí</i> and <i>lungan</i>, are allied to
the Sapindus in their affinities; while the <i>fung shu</i>, or Liquidambar,
and many sorts of maple, with the <i>Pittosporum tobira</i>,
an ornamental shrub, may be mentioned among plants used for
food or sought after for timber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORNAMENTAL PLANTS, ETC.</div>

<p>These brief notices of Chinese plants may be concluded by
mentioning some of the most ornamental not before spoken of;
but all the beautiful sorts are soon introduced into western
conservatories by enterprising florists. In the extensive tribe
of Rubiacinæ are several species of honeysuckle, and a fragrant
Viburnum resembling the snowball. The Serissa is cultivated
around beds like the box; the <i>Ixora coccinea</i>, and other species
of that genus, are among common garden shrubs. The seeds of
two or three species of Artemisia are collected, dried, and reduced
to a down, to be burned as an actual cautery. The dried
twigs are frequently woven into a rope to slowly consume as
a means of driving away mosquitoes. From the <i>Carthamus
tinctoirus</i> a fine red dye is prepared. The succory, lettuce, dandelion,
and other cichoraceous plants, either wild or cultivated,
furnish food; while innumerable varieties of Chrysanthemums
and Asters are reared for their beauty.</p>

<p>The Labiatæ afford many genera, some of them cultivated;
and the Solanaceæ, or nightshades, contain the tomato, potato,
tobacco, stramony, and several species of Capsicum, or red pepper.
It has been disputed whether tobacco is native or foreign,
but the philological argument and historical notices prove that
both this plant and maize were introduced within half a century
after the discovery of America, or about the year 1530. The
Chinese dry the leaves and cut them into shreds for smoking;
the snuff is coarser and less pungent than the Scotch; it is said
that powdered cinnabar is sometimes mixed with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Convolvulaceæ are many beautiful species of Ipomea,
especially the cypress vine, or <i>quamoclit</i>, trained about the
houses even of the poorest. The <i>Ipomea maritima</i> occurs, trailing
over the sandy beaches along the coast from Hainan to
Chusan and Lewchew. The <i>Convolvulus reptans</i> is planted
around the edges of pools on the confines of villages and fields,
for the sake of its succulent leaves. The narcotic family of
Apocyneæ contains the oleander and Plumeria, prized for their
fragrance; while the yellow milkweed (<i>Asclepias curassavica</i>)
and the <i>Vinca rosea</i>, or red periwinkle, are less conspicuous,
but not unattractive, members of the same group. The jasmine
is a deserved favorite, its clusters of flowers being often wound
by women in their hair, and planted in pots in their houses.
The <i>Olea fragrans</i>, or <i>kwei hwa</i>, is cultivated for scenting tea.</p>

<p>In the eastern provinces the hills are adorned with yellow and
red azaleas of gorgeous hue, especially around Ningpo and in
Chusan. “Few,” says Mr. Fortune, “can form any idea of the
gorgeous beauty of these azalea-clad hills, where, on every side,
the eye rests on masses of flowers of dazzling brightness and
surpassing beauty. Nor is it the azalea alone which claims our
admiration; clematises, wild roses, honeysuckles, and a hundred
others, mingle their flowers with them, and make us confess
that China is indeed the ‘central flowery land.’”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PUN TSAO, OR CHINESE HERBAL.</div>

<p>A few notices of the advance made by the Chinese themselves
in the study of natural history, taken from their great work on
materia medica, the <cite>Pun tsao</cite>, or ‘Herbal,’ will form an appropriate
conclusion to this chapter. This work is usually bound
in forty octavo volumes, divided into fifty-two chapters, and
contains many observations of value mixed up with a deal of
incorrect and useless matter; and as those who read the book
have not sufficient knowledge to discriminate between what is
true and what is partly or wholly wrong, its reputation tends
greatly to perpetuate the errors. The compiler of the <cite>Pun tsao</cite>,
Lí Shí-chin, spent thirty years in collecting all the information
on these subjects extant in his time, arranged it in a methodical
manner for popular use, adding his own observations, and pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>lished
it about 1590. He consulted some eight hundred preceding
authors, from whom he selected one thousand five hundred
and eighteen prescriptions, and added three hundred and
seventy-four new ones, arranging his materials in fifty-two books
in a methodical and (for his day) scientific manner. But how
far behind the writings of Pliny and Dioscorides! The nucleus
of Lí’s production is a small work which tradition ascribes to
Shinnung, the God of Agriculture, and is doubtless anterior to
the Han dynasty. His composition was well received, and attracted
the notice of the Emperor, who ordered several succeeding
editions to be published at the expense of the state. It
was, in fact, so great an advance on all previous books, that it
checked future writers in that branch, and Lí is likely now to
be the first and last purely native critical writer on natural science
in his mother tongue.</p>

<p>The first two volumes contain a collection of prefaces and
indices, together with many notices of the theory of anatomy
and medicine, and three books of pictorial illustrations of the
rudest sort. Chapters I. and II. consist of introductory observations
upon the practice of medicine, and an index of the
recipes contained in the work, called the <cite>Sure Guide to a
Myriad of Recipes</cite>; the whole filling the first seven volumes.
Chapters III. and IV. contain lists of medicines for the cure of
all diseases, occupying three volumes and a half, and comprising
the therapeutical portion of the work, except a treatise on the
pulse in the last volume.</p>

<p>In the subsequent chapters the author carefully goes over
the entire range of nature, first giving the correct name and
its explanation; then comes descriptive remarks, solutions of
doubts and corrections of errors being interspersed, closing with
notes on the savor, taste, and application of the recipes in
which it is used. Chapters V. and VI. treat of inorganic
substances under water and fire, and minerals under Chapters
VII. to XI., as earth, metals, gems, and stones. Water is
divided into aerial and terrestrial, <i>i.e.</i>, from the clouds, and
from springs, the ocean, etc. Fire is considered under eleven
species, among which are the flames of coal, bamboo, moxa,
etc. The chapter on earth comprises the secretions from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
various animals, as well as soot, ink, etc.; that on metals includes
metallic substances and their common oxides; and gems
are spoken of in the next division. The eleventh chapter, in
true Chinese style, groups together what could not be placed
in the preceding sections, including salts, minerals, etc. In
looking at this arrangement one detects the similarity between
it and the classification of characters in the language itself,
showing the influence this has had upon it; thus <i>ho</i>, <i>shui</i>, <i>tu</i>,
<i>kin</i>, <i>yuh</i>, <i>shih</i>, and <i>lu</i>, or fire, water, earth, metals, gems,
stones, and salts, are the seven radicals under which the names
of inorganic substances are classified in the imperial dictionary.
A like similarity runs through other parts of the <cite>Herbal</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOTANY OF THE HERBAL.</div>

<p>Chapters XII. to XXXVII., inclusive, treat of the vegetable
kingdom, under five <i>pu</i>, or ‘divisions,’ viz.: herbs, grains, vegetables,
fruits, and trees; which are again subdivided into <i>lui</i>, or
‘families,’ though the members of these families have no more
relationship to each other than the heterogeneous family of an
Egyptian slave dealer. The lowest term in the Chinese scientific
scale is <i>chung</i>, which sometimes includes a genus, but
quite as often corresponds to a species or even a variety, as
Linneus understood those terms.</p>

<p>The first division of herbs contains nine families, viz.: hill
plants, odoriferous, marshy, noxious, scandent or climbing,
aquatic, stony, and mossy plants, and a ninth of one hundred
and sixty-two miscellaneous plants not used in medicine, making
six hundred and seventy-eight species in all. In this classification
the habitat is the most influential principle of arrangement
for the families, while the term <i>tsao</i>, or ‘herb,’ denotes
whatever is not eaten or used in the arts, or which does not attain
to the magnitude of a tree.</p>

<p>The second division of grains contains four families, viz.: 1,
that of hemp, sesamum, buckwheat, wheat, rice, etc.; 2, the
family of millet, maize, opium, etc.; 3, leguminous plants,
pulse, peas, vetches, etc.; and 4, fermentable things, as bean
curd, boiled rice, wine, yeast, congee, bread, etc., which, as they
are used in medicine, and produced from vegetables, seem most
naturally to come in this place. The first three families embrace
thirty-nine species, and the last twenty-nine articles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>The third division of kitchen herbs contains five families: 1,
offensive pungent plants, as leeks, mustard, ginger; 2, soft and
mucilaginous plants, as dandelions, lilies, bamboo sprouts; 3,
vegetables producing fruit on the ground, as tomatoes, egg-plants,
melons; 4, aquatic vegetables; and 5, mushrooms and
fungi. The number of species is one hundred and thirty-three,
and some part of each of them is eaten.</p>

<p>The fourth division of fruits contains seven families: 1, the
five fruits, the plum, peach, apricot, chestnut, and date (Rhamnus);
2, hill fruits, as the orange, pear, citron, persimmon; 3,
foreign fruits, as the cocoanut, líchí, carambola; 4, aromatic
fruits, as pepper, cubebs, tea; 5, trailing fruits, as melons,
grape, sugar-cane; 6, aquatic fruits, as water caltrops, water
lily, water chestnuts, etc.; and 7, fruits not used in medicine,
as whampe. In all, one hundred and forty-seven species.</p>

<p>The fifth division of trees has six families: 1, odoriferous
trees, as pine, cassia, aloes, camphor; 2, stately trees, as the
willow, tamarix, elm, soapberry, palm, poplar, julibrissin or silk
tree; 3, luxuriant growing trees, as mulberry, cotton, Cercis,
Gardenia, Bombax, Hibiscus; 4, parasites or things attached to
trees, as the mistletoe, pachyma, and amber; 5, flexible plants,
as bamboo; this family has only four species; 6, includes what
the other five exclude, though it might have been thought that
the second and third families were sufficiently comprehensive
to contain almost all miscellaneous plants. The number of
species is one hundred and ninety-eight. All botanical subjects
are classified in this manner under five divisions, thirty-one
families, and one thousand one hundred and ninety-five
species, excluding all fermentable things.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the botanical characters in the language
does not correspond so well to this as does that of inorganic
substances. The largest group in the language system is <i>tsao</i>,
which comprises in general such herbaceous plants as are not
used for food. The second, <i>muh</i>, includes all trees or shrubs;
and the bamboo, on account of its great usefulness, stands by itself,
though the characters mostly denote names of articles made
of bamboo. No less than four radicals, viz., rice, wheat, millet,
and grain, serve as the heads under which the esculent grasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
are arranged; there are consequently many synonymes and
superfluous distinctions. One family includes beans, and another
legumes; one comprises cucurbitaceous plants, another
the alliaceous, and a fourth the hempen; the importance of
these plants as articles of food or manufacture no doubt suggested
their adoption. Thus all vegetable substances are distributed
in the language under eleven different heads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS ZOÖLOGY AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE HORSE.</div>

<p>The zoölogical grouping in the <cite>Pun tsao</cite> is as rude and unscientific
as that of plants. There are five <i>pu</i>, or divisions,
namely: insect, scaly, shelly, feathered, and hairy animals. The
first division contains four families: 1 and 2, insects born
from eggs, as bees and silkworms, butterflies and spiders; 3,
insects produced by metamorphosis, as glow-worms, mole-crickets,
bugs; and 4, water insects, as toads, centipedes, etc.
The second division has four families: 1, the dragons, including
the manis, “the only fish that has legs;” 2, snakes; 3,
fishes having scales; and 4, scaleless fishes, as the eel, cuttle-fish,
prawn. The third division is classified under the two
heads of tortoises or turtles and mollusks, including the starfish,
echinus, hermit-crab, etc. The fourth division contains
birds arranged under four families: 1, water-fowl, as herons,
king-fishers, etc.; 2, heath-fowl, sparrows, and pheasants; 3,
forest birds, as magpies, crows; and 4, wild birds, as eagles
and hawks. Beasts form the fifth division, which likewise
contains four families: 1, the nine domesticated animals and
their products; 2, wild animals, as lions, deers, otters; 3,
rodentia, as the squirrel, hedgehog, rat; and 4, monkeys and
fairies. The number of species in these five divisions is three
hundred and ninety-one, but there are only three hundred and
twenty different objects described, as the roe, fat, hair, exuviæ,
etc., of animals are separately noticed.</p>

<p>The sixteen zoölogical characters in the language are not
quite so far astray from being types of classes as the eleven
botanical ones. Nine of them are mammiferous, viz.: the tiger,
dog, and leopard, which stand for the carnivora; the rat for
rodentia; the ox, sheep, and deer for ruminants; and the
horse and hog for pachydermatous. Birds are chiefly comprised
under one radical <i>niao</i>, but there is a sub-family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
short-tailed gallinaceous fowls, though much confusion exists in
the division. Fishes form one group, and improperly include
crabs, lizards, whales, and snakes, though most of the latter are
placed along with insects, or else under the dragons. The tortoise,
toad, and dragon are the types of three small collections,
and insects are comprised in the sixteenth and last. These
groups, although they contain many anomalies, as might be
expected, are still sufficiently natural to teach those who write
the language something of the world around them. Thus,
when one sees that a new character contains the radical <i>dog</i> in
composition, he will be sure that it is neither fowl, fish, nor bug,
nor any animal of the pachydermatous, cervine, or ruminant
tribes, although he may have never seen the animal nor heard
its name. This peculiarity runs through the whole language, indeed,
but in other groups, as for instance those under the radicals
man, woman, and child, or heart, hand, leg, etc., the characters
include mental and passionate emotions, as well as actions and
names, so that the type is not sufficiently indicative to convey a
definite idea of the words included under it; the names of
natural objects being most easily arranged in this manner.</p>

<p>Between the account of plants and animals the <cite>Herbal</cite> has
one chapter on garments and domestic utensils, for such things
“are used in medicine and are made out of plants.” The remaining
chapters, XXXIX.-LII., treat of animals, as noticed
above. The properties of the objects spoken of are discussed
in a very methodical manner, so that a student can immediately
turn to a plant or mineral and ascertain its virtue. For instance,
the information relative to the history and uses of the
horse is contained in twenty-four sections. The first explains
the character, <i>ma</i>, which was originally intended to represent
the outline of the animal. The second describes the varieties
of horses, the best kinds for medical use, and gives brief descriptions
of them, for the guidance of the practitioner. “The
pure white are the best for medicine. Those found in the south
and east are small and weak. The age is known by the teeth.
The eye reflects the full image of a man. If he eats rice his
feet will become heavy; if rat’s dung, his belly will grow long;
if his teeth be rubbed with dead silkworms, or black plums, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
will not eat, nor if the skin of a rat or wolf be hung in his
manger. He should not be allowed to eat from a hog’s trough,
lest he contract disease; and if a monkey is kept in the stable
he will not fall sick.”</p>

<p>The third section goes on to speak of the flesh, which is an
article of food; that of a pure white stallion is the most wholesome.
One author recommends “eating almonds, and taking a
rush broth, if the person feel uncomfortable after a meal of
horse-flesh. It should be roasted and eaten with ginger
and pork; and to eat the flesh of a black horse, and not
drink wine with it, will surely produce death.” The fourth
describes the crown of the horse, the “fat of which is sweet,
and good to make the hair grow and the face to shine.” The
fifth and succeeding sections to the twenty-fourth treat of the
sanative properties and mode of exhibiting the milk, heart,
lungs, liver, kidneys, placenta, teeth, bones, skin, mane, tail,
brains, blood, perspiration, and excrements.</p>

<p>Some of the directions are dietetic, and others are prescriptive.
“When eating horse-flesh do not eat the liver,” is one of
the former, given because of the absence of a gall-bladder in
the liver, which imports its poisonous qualities. “The heart of
a white horse, or that of a hog, cow, or hen, when dried and
rasped into spirit and so taken, cures forgetfulness; if the patient
hears one thing he knows ten.” “Above the knees the
horse has <i>night-eyes</i> (warts), which enable him to go in the
night; they are useful in the toothache;” these sections partake
both of the descriptive and prescriptive. Another medical one
is: “If a man be restless and hysterical when he wishes to
sleep, and it is requisite to put him to rest, let the ashes of a
skull be mingled with water and given him, and let him have a
skull for a pillow, and it will cure him.” The same preservative
virtues appear to be ascribed to a horse’s hoof hung in a
house as are supposed, by some who should know better, to
belong to a horseshoe when nailed upon the door.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The whole
of this extensive work is liberally sprinkled with such whimsies,
but the practice of medicine among the Chinese is vastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
better than their theories; for as Rémusat justly observes, “To
see well and reason falsely are not wholly incompatible, and the
naturalists of China, as well as the chemists and physicians of
our ancient schools, have sometimes tried to reconcile them.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATURAL SCIENCES IN CHINA.</div>

<p>Another work on botany besides the <cite>Herbal</cite>, issued in 1848,
deserves notice for its research and the excellence of its drawings.
It is the <cite>Chih Wuh Ming-shih Tu-kao</cite>, or <cite>Researches
into the Names and Virtues of Plants</cite>, with plates, in sixty volumes.
There are one thousand seven hundred and fifteen
drawings of plants, with descriptions of each, arranged in
eleven books, followed by medical and agricultural observations
on the most important in four books. One of its valuable
points to the foreigner is the terminology furnished by
the two authors for describing the parts and uses of plants.
Rémusat read a paper in 1828, ‘On the State of the Natural
Sciences among the Orientals,’ in which he indicates the position
attained by Chinese in their researches into the nature
and uses of objects around them. After speaking of the adaptation
the language possesses, from its construction, to impart
some general notions of animated and vegetable nature,
he goes on to remark upon the theorizing propensities of their
writers, instead of contenting themselves with examining and
recording facts. “In place of studying the organization of
bodies, they undertake to determine by reasoning how it should
be, an aim which has not seldom led them far from the end
they proposed. One of the strangest errors among them relates
to the transformation of beings into each other, which has
arisen from popular stories or badly conducted observations on
the metamorphoses of insects. Learned absurdities have been
added to puerile prejudices; that which the vulgar have believed
the philosophers have attempted to explain, and nothing
can be easier, according to the oriental systems of cosmogony, in
which a simple matter, infinitely diversified, shows itself in all
beings. Changes affect only the apparent properties of bodies, or
rather the bodies themselves have only appearances; according
to these principles, they are not astonished at seeing the electric
fluid or even the stars converted into stones, as happens when
aerolites fall. That animated beings become inanimate is proven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
by fossils and petrifactions. Ice enclosed in the earth for a millennium
becomes rock crystal; and it is only necessary that lead,
the <i>father</i> of all metals (as Saturn, its alchemistic type, was of
gods), pass through four periods of two centuries each to become
successively cinnabar, tin, and silver. In spring the rat changes
into a quail, and quails into rats again during the eighth month.</p>

<p>“The style in which these marvels is related is now and then
a little equivocal; but if they believe part of them proved, they
can see nothing really impossible in the others. One naturalist,
less credulous than his fellows, rather smiles at another author
who reported the metamorphosis of an oriole into a mole, and
of rice into a carp; ‘it is a ridiculous story,’ says he; ‘there is
proof only of the change of rats into quails, which is reported
in the almanac, and which I have often seen myself, for there
is an unvaried progression, as well of transformations as of generations.’
Animals, according to the Chinese, are viviparous as
quadrupeds, or oviparous as birds; they grow by transformations,
as insects, or by the effect of humidity, as snails, slugs,
and centipedes.... The success of such systems is almost
always sure, not in China alone either, because it is easier to
put words in place of things, to stop at nothing, and to have
formulas ready for solving all questions. It is thus that they
have formed a scientific jargon, which one might almost think
had been borrowed from our dark ages, and which has powerfully
contributed to retain knowledge in China in the swaddling-clothes
we now find it. Experience teaches that when the
human mind is once drawn into a false way, the lapse of ages
and the help of a man of genius are necessary to draw it out.
Ages have not been wanting in China, but the man whose superior
enlightenment might dissipate these deceitful glimmerings,
would find it very difficult to exercise this happy influence
as long as their political institutions attract all their inquiring
minds or vigorous intellects far away from scientific researches
into the literary examinations, or put before them the honors
and employments which the functions and details of magisterial
appointments bring with them.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">CONSERVATISM OF NATIVE RESEARCH.</div>

<p>This last observation indicates the reason, to a great degree,
for the fixedness of the Chinese in all departments of learned
inquiry; hard labor employs the energy and time of the ignorant
mass, and emulation in the strife to reach official dignities
consumes and perverts the talents of the learned. Then their
language itself disheartens the most enthusiastic students in
this branch of study, on account of its vagueness and want of established
terms. When the vivifying and strengthening truths
of revelation shall be taught to the Chinese, and its principles
acted upon among them, we may expect more vigor in their
minds and more profit in their investigations into the wonders
of nature.</p>

<span class="smaller">LAWS OF CHINA, AND PLAN OF ITS GOVERNMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The consideration of the theory and practice of the Chinese
government recommends itself to the attention of the intelligent
student of man by several peculiar reasons, among which are its
acknowledged antiquity, the multitudes of people it rules, and
the comparative quiet enjoyed by its subjects. The government
of a heathen nation is so greatly modified by the personal
character of the executive, and the people are so liable to confound
institutions with men, either from imperfect acquaintance
with the nature of those institutions, or from being, through
necessity or habit, easily guided and swayed by designing and
powerful men, that the long continuance of the Chinese polity
is a proof both of its adaptation to the habits and condition of
the people, and of its general good management. The antiquity
and excellence of such a government, and its orderly administration,
might, however, be far greater than it is in China, without
being invested with the interest which at present attaches to it
in that Empire in consequence of the immense population, whose
lives and property, food and well-being, depend to so great a
degree upon it. What was at first rather a feeling of curiosity,
gradually becomes one of awe, when the evil results of misgovernment,
or the beneficent effects of equitable rule, are seen to
be so momentous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEORY OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>The theory of the Chinese government is undoubtedly the
patriarchal; the Emperor is the sire, his officers are the responsible
elders of its provinces, departments, and districts, as every
father of a household is of its inmates. This may, perhaps, be
the theory of other governments, but nowhere has it been sys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>tematized
so thoroughly, and acted upon so consistently and for so
long a period, as in China. Two causes, mutually acting upon
each other, have, more than anything else, combined to give
efficiency to this theory. The ancient rule of Yau and Shun<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
was strictly, so far as the details are known, a patriarchal chieftainship,
conferred upon them on account of their excellent
character; and their successors under Yu of the Hia dynasty
were considered as deriving their power from heaven, to whom
they were amenable for its good use. When Chingtang, founder
of the Shang dynasty, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1766, and Wu Wang, of the Chau,
B.C. 1122, took up arms against the Emperors, the excuse given
was that they had not fulfilled the decrees of heaven, and had
thereby forfeited their claim to the throne.</p>

<p>Confucius, in teaching his principles of political ethics, referred
to the conduct of those ancient kings both for proof of the correctness
of his instructions and for arguments to enforce them.
The large number of those who followed him during his lifetime
furnishes some evidence that his countrymen assented to
the propriety of his teachings. This may account for their reception,
illustrated as they were by the high character the sage
bore; but it was not till the lapse of two or three centuries
that the rulers of China perceived the great security the adoption
and diffusion of these doctrines would give their sway.
They therefore turned their attention toward the embodiment of
these precepts into laws, and toward basing the institutions of
government upon them; through all the convulsions and wars
which have disturbed the country and changed the reigning
families, these writings have done more than any one thing
else to uphold the institutions of the Chinese and give them
their character and permanence. Education being founded on
them, those who as students had been taught to receive and
reverence them as the oracles of political wisdom, would, when
they entered upon the duties of office, endeavor to carry out, in
some degree at least, their principles. Thus the precept and
the practice have mutually modified, supported, and enforced
each other.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>
<p>But this civilization is Asiatic and not European, pagan and
not Christian. The institutions of China are despotic and defective,
and founded on wrong principles. They may have the
element of stability, but not of improvement. The patriarchal
theory does not make men honorable, truthful, or kind; it does
not place woman in her right position, nor teach all classes
their obligations to their Maker; the wonder is, to those who
know the strength of evil passions in the human breast, that
this huge mass of mankind is no worse. We must, indeed,
look into its structure in order to discover the causes of this
stability, inasmuch as here we have neither a standing army to
enforce nor the machinery of a state religion to compel obedience
toward a sovereign. A short inspection will show that the
great leading principles by which the present administration
preserves its power over the people, consist in a system of
<em>strict surveillance</em> and <em>mutual responsibility</em> among all classes.
These are aided in their efficiency by the geographical isolation
of the country, a remarkable spirit of loyal pride in their own
history, and a general system of political education and official
examinations.</p>

<p>These two principles are enforced by such a minute gradation
of rank and subordination of offices as to give the government
more of a military character than at first appears, and the whole
system is such as to make it one of the most unmixed oligarchies
now existing. It is like a network extending over the
whole face of society, each individual being isolated in his own
mesh but responsibly connected with all around him. The
man who knows that it is almost impossible, except by entire
seclusion, to escape from the company of secret or acknowledged
emissaries of government, will be cautious of offending the
laws of the country, knowing, as he must, that though he
should himself escape, yet his family, his kindred, or his neighbors
will suffer for his offence; that if unable to recompense
the sufferers, it will probably be dangerous for him to return
home; or if he does, it will be most likely to find his property
in the possession of neighbors or officials, who feel conscious of
security in plundering one whose offences have forever placed
him under a ban.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">RESPONSIBILITY, FEAR, AND ISOLATION.</div>

<p>The effect of these two causes upon the mass of the people is
to imbue them with a great fear of the government, both of its
officers and its operations; each man considers that safety is
best to be found in keeping aloof from both. This mutual surveillance
and responsibility, though only partially extended throughout
the multitude, necessarily undermines confidence and infuses
universal distrust; while this object of complete isolation,
though at the expense of justice, truth, honesty, and natural
affection, is what the government strives to accomplish and
actually does to a wonderful degree. The idea of government
in the minds of the uneducated people is that of some ever-present
terror, like a sword of Damocles; and so far has this
undefined fear of some untoward result when connected with
it counteracted the real vigor of the Chinese, that to it may
be referred much of their indifference to improvement, contentment
with what is already known and possessed, and submission
to petty injustice and spoliation.</p>

<p>Men are deterred, too, as much by distrust of each other as
by fear of the police, from combining in an intelligent manner
to resist governmental exactions because opposed to principles
of equity, or joining with their rulers to uphold good order; no
such men, and no such instances, as John Hampden going to
prison for refusing to subscribe to a forced loan, or Thomas
Williams and his companions throwing the tea overboard in
Boston harbor, ever occurred in China or any other Asiatic
country. They dread illegal societies quite as much from the
cruelties this same distrust induces the leaders to exercise over
recreant or suspected members, as from apprehension of arrest
and punishment by the regular authorities. Thus, with a state
of society at times on the verge of insurrection, this mass of
people is kept in check by the threefold cord of responsibility,
fear, and isolation, each of them strengthening the other, and
all depending upon the character of the people for much of
their efficiency. Since all the officers of government received
their intellectual training when commoners under these influences,
it is easy to understand why the supreme powers are so
averse to improvement and to foreign intercourse&mdash;from both of
which causes, in truth, the monarch has the greatest reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
dread lest the charm of his power be weakened and his sceptre
pass away.</p>

<p>There is, however, a further explanation for the general
peace which prevails to be found back of this. It is owing
partly to the diffusion of a political education among the people&mdash;teaching
them the principles on which all government is
founded, and the reasons for those principles flowing from the
patriarchal theory&mdash;and partly to their plodding, industrious
character. A brief exposition of the construction and divisions
of the central and provincial governments and their mutual
relations, and the various duties devolving upon the departments
and officers, will exhibit more of the operation of
these principles.</p>

<p>Although the Emperor is regarded as the head of this great
organization, as the fly-wheel which sets other wheels of the
machine in motion, he is still considered as bound to rule according
to the code of the land; and when there is a well-known
law, though the source of law, he is expected to follow
it in his decrees. The statutes of China form an edifice, the
foundations of which were laid by Lí Kwei twenty centuries
ago. Successive dynasties have been building thereon ever
since, adding, altering, pulling down, and putting together as
circumstances seemed to require. The people have a high regard
for the code, “and all they seem to desire is its just and
impartial execution, independent of caprice and uninfluenced
by corruption. That the laws of China are, on the contrary,
very frequently violated by those who are their administrators
and constitutional guardians, there can, unfortunately, be no
question; but to what extent, comparatively with the laws of
other countries, must at present be very much a matter of conjecture:
at the same time it may be observed, as something in
favor of the Chinese system, that there are substantial grounds
for believing that neither flagrant nor repeated acts of injustice
do, in point of fact, often, in any rank or station, ultimately
escape with impunity.”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Sir George Staunton is well qualified
to speak on this point, and his opinion has been corroborated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
by most of those who have had similar opportunities of judging;
while his translation of the <cite>Code</cite> has given all persons
interested in the question the means of ascertaining the principles
on which the government ostensibly acts.</p>

<p>This body of laws is called <cite>Ta Tsing Liuh Lí</cite>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Statutes
and Rescripts of the Great Pure Dynasty,’ and contains all the
laws of the Empire. They are arranged under seven leading
heads, viz.: General, Civil, Fiscal, Ritual, Military, and Criminal
laws, and those relating to Public Works; and subdivided into
four hundred and thirty-six sections, called <i>liuh</i>, or ‘statutes,’ to
which the <i>lí</i>, or modern clauses, to limit, explain or alter them, are
added; these are now much more numerous than the original
statutes. A new edition is published by authority every five years;
in the reprint of 1830 the Emperor ordered that the Supreme
Court should make but few alterations, lest wily litigants might
take advantage of the discrepancies between the new and old law
to suit their own purposes. This edition is in twenty-eight volumes,
and is one of the most frequently seen books in the shops
of any city. The clauses are attached to each statute, and have
the same force. No authorized reports of cases and decisions,
either of the provincial or supreme courts, are published for
general use, though their record is kept in the court where they
are decided; the publication of such adjudged cases, as a guide
to officers, is not unknown. An extensive collection of notes,
comments, and cases, illustrating the practice and theory of the
laws, was appended to the edition of 1799.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PENAL CODE OF CHINA.</div>

<p>A short extract from the original preface of the <cite>Code</cite>, published
in 1647, only three years after the Manchu Emperors
took the throne, will explain the principles on which it was
drawn up. After remarking upon the inconveniences arising
from the necessity of aggravating or mitigating the sentences
of the magistrates, who, previous to the re-establishment of an
authentic code of penal laws, were not in possession of any fixed
rules upon which they could build a just decision, the Emperor
Shunchí goes on to describe the manner of revising the code:</p>

<p>“A numerous body of magistrates was assembled at the
capital, at our command, for the purpose of revising the penal
code formerly in force under the late dynasty of Ming, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
digesting the same into a new code, by the exclusion of such
parts as were exceptionable and the introduction of others
which were likely to contribute to the attainment of justice and
the general perfection of the work. The result of their labors
having been submitted to our examination, we maturely weighed
and considered the various matters it contained, and then instructed
a select number of our great officers of state carefully
to revise the whole, for the purpose of making such alterations
and emendations as might still be found requisite. Wherefore,
it being now published, let it be your great care, officers and
magistrates of the interior and exterior departments of our Empire,
diligently to observe the same, and to forbear in future to
give any decision, or to pass any sentence, according to your
private sentiments, or upon your unsupported authority. Thus
shall the magistrates and people look up with awe and submission
to the justice of these institutions, as they find themselves
respectively concerned in them; the transgressor will not fail
to suffer a strict expiation of his crimes, and will be the instrument
of deterring others from similar misconduct; and finally
both officers and people will be equally secured for endless generations
in the enjoyment of the happy effects of the great
and noble virtues of our illustrious progenitors.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENERAL, CIVIL, AND FISCAL LAWS.</div>

<p>Under the head of General Laws are forty-seven sections,
comprising principles and definitions applicable to the whole,
and containing some singular notions on equity and criminality.
The description of the five ordinary punishments, definition of
the ten treasonable offences, regulations for the eight privileged
classes, and general directions regarding the conduct of officers
of government, are the matters treated of under this head.
The title of Section XLIV. is “On the decision of cases not provided
for by law;” and the rule is that “such cases may then
be determined by an accurate comparison with others which are
already provided for, and which approach most nearly to those
under investigation, in order to ascertain afterward to what extent
an aggravation or mitigation of the punishment would be
equitable. A provisional sentence conformable thereto shall be
laid before the superior magistrates, and, after receiving their
approbation, be submitted to the Emperor’s final decision. Any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
erroneous judgment which may be pronounced, in consequence
of adopting a more summary mode of proceeding in cases of a
doubtful nature, shall be punished as wilful deviation from justice.”
This, of course, gives great latitude to the magistrate, and
as he is thus allowed to decide and act before the new law can
be confirmed or annulled, the chief restraints to his injustice in
such cases (which, however, are not numerous) lie in the fear
of an appeal and its consequences, or of summary reprisals
from the suffering parties.</p>

<p>The six remaining divisions pertain to the six administrative
boards of the government. The second contains Civil Laws,
under twenty-eight sections, divided into two books, one of
them referring to the system of government, and the other to
the conduct of magistrates, etc. The hereditary succession of
rank and titles is regulated, and punishments laid down for
those who illegally assume these honors. Most of the nobility
of China are Manchus, and none of the hereditary dignities existing
previous to the conquest were recognized, except those
attached to the family of Confucius. Improperly recommending
unfit persons as deserving high honors, appointing and
removing officers without the Emperor’s sanction, and leaving
stations without due permission, are the principal subjects
regulated in the first book. The second book contains rules
regarding the interference of superior magistrates with the proceedings
of the lower courts, and prohibitions against cabals and
treasonable combinations among officers, which are of course
capital crimes; all persons in the employ of the state are required
to make themselves acquainted with the laws, and even
private individuals “who are found capable of explaining the
nature and comprehending the objects of the laws, shall receive
pardon in all offences resulting purely from accident, or imputable
to them only from the guilt of others, provided it be the
first offence.”</p>

<p>The third division, of Fiscal Laws, under eighty-two sections,
contains rules for enrolling the people, and of succession and
inheritance; also laws for regulating marriages between various
classes of society, for guarding granaries and treasuries, for
preventing and punishing smuggling, for restraining usury, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
for overseeing shops. Section LXXVI. orders that persons and
families truly represent their profession in life, and restrains
them from indulging in a change of occupation; “generation
after generation they must not vary or alter it.” This rule is,
however, constantly violated. Section XC. exempts the buildings
of literary and religious institutions from taxation. The
general aim of the laws relating to holding real estate is to
secure the cultivation of all the land taken up, and the regular
payment of the tax. The proprietor, in some cases, can be deprived
of his lands because he does not till them, and though in
fact owner in fee simple, he is restricted in the disposition of
them by will in many ways, and forfeits them if the taxes are
not paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RITUAL, MILITARY, AND CRIMINAL LAWS.</div>

<p>The fourth division, of Ritual Laws, under twenty-six sections,
contains the regulations for state sacrifices and ceremonies,
those appertaining to the worship of ancestors, and whatever
belongs to heterodox and magical sects or teachers. The heavy
penalties threatened in some of these sections against all illegal
combinations under the guise of a new form of worship presents
an interesting likeness to the restrictions issued by the
English, French, and German princes during and after the
Reformation. The Chinese authorities had the same dread
lest the people should meet and consult how to resist them.
Even processions in honor of the gods may be forbidden for
good reason, and are not allowed at all at Peking; while, still
more, the rites observed by the Emperor cannot be imitated by
any unauthorized person; women are not allowed to congregate
in the temples, nor magicians to perform any strange incantations.
Few of these laws are really necessary, and those
against illegal sects are in fact levelled against political associations,
which usually take on a religious guise.</p>

<p>The fifth division, of Military Laws, in seventy-one sections,
provides for the protection of the palace and government of
the army, for guarding frontier passes, management of the
imperial cattle, and forwarding despatches by couriers. Some
of these ordinances lay down rules for the protection of the
Emperor’s person, and the disposition of his body-guard and
troops in the palace, the capital, and over the Empire. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
sections relating to the government of the army include the
rules for the police of cities; and those designed to secure the
protection of the frontier comprise all the enactments against
foreign intercourse, some of which have already been referred to
in passing. The supply of horses and cattle for the army is a
matter of some importance, and is minutely regulated; one law
orders all persons who possess vicious and dangerous animals to
restrain them, and if through neglect any person is killed or
wounded, the owner of the animal shall be obliged to redeem
himself from the punishment of manslaughter by paying a fine.
This provision to compel the owners of unruly beasts to exercise
proper restraint over them is like that laid down by Moses
in Exodus XXI., 29, 30. There is as yet no general post-office
establishment, but governmental couriers often take
private letters; local mails are safely carried by express companies.
The required rate of travel for the official post is one
hundred miles a day, but it does not ordinarily go more than
half that distance. Officers of government are allowed ninety
days to make the journey from Peking to Canton, a distance of
twelve hundred miles, but couriers frequently travel it in twelve
days.</p>

<p>The sixth division, on Criminal Laws, is arranged in eleven
books, containing in all one hundred and seventy sections, and
is the most important of the whole. The clauses under some of
the sections are numerous, and show that it is not for want of
proper laws or insufficient threatenings that crimes go unpunished.
The books of this division relate to robbery, in which is
included high treason and renunciation of allegiance; to homicide
and murder; quarrelling and fighting; abusive language; indictments,
disobedience to parents, and false accusations; bribery
and corruption; forging and frauds; incest and adultery; arrests
and escapes of criminals, their imprisonment and execution;
and, lastly, miscellaneous offences.</p>

<p>Under Section CCCXXIX. it is ordered that any one who
is guilty of addressing abusive language to his or her father or
mother, or father’s parents, or a wife who rails at her husband’s
parents or grandparents, shall be strangled; provided always
that the persons so abused themselves complain to the magis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>trate,
and had personally heard the language addressed to them.
This law is the same in regard to children as that contained
in Leviticus XX., 9, and the power here given the parent does
not seem to be productive of evil. Section CCCLXXXI. has
reference to “privately hushing up public crimes,” but its
penalties are for the most part a dead letter, and a full account
of the various modes adopted in the courts of withdrawing cases
from the cognizance of superiors, would form a singular chapter
in Chinese jurisprudence. Consequently those who refuse every
offer to suppress cases are highly lauded by the people. Another
section (CCCLXXXVI.) ordains that whoever is guilty of improper
conduct, contrary to the spirit of the laws, but not a
breach of any specific article, shall be punished at least with
forty blows, and with eighty when of a serious nature. Some
of the provisions of this part of the code are praiseworthy, but
no part of Chinese legislation is so cruel and irregular as criminal
jurisprudence. The permission accorded to the judge to
torture the criminal opens the door for much inhumanity.</p>

<p>The seventh division contains thirteen sections relating to
Public Works and Ways, such as the weaving of interdicted
patterns of silk, repairing dikes, and constructing edifices for
government. All public residences, granaries, treasuries and
manufactories, embankments and dikes of rivers and canals,
forts, walls, and mausolea, must be frequently examined, and
kept in repair. Poverty or peculation render many of these
laws void, and many subterfuges are often practised by the
superintending officer to pocket as much of the funds as he can.
One officer, when ordered to repair a wall, made the workmen
go over it and chip off the faces of the stones still remaining,
then plastering up the holes.</p>

<p>Besides these laws and their numerous clauses, every high
provincial officer has the right to issue edicts upon such public
matters as require regulation, some of them even affecting
life and death, either reviving some old law or giving it an application
to the case before him, with such modifications as
seem to be necessary. He must report these acts to the proper
board at Peking. No such order, which for the time has the
force of law, is formally repealed, but gradually falls into obliv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>ion,
until circumstances again require its reiteration. This
mode of publishing statutes gives rise to a sort of common and
unwritten law in villages, to which a council of elders sometimes
compels individuals to submit; long usage is also another
ground for enforcing them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRITICISM OF THE CODE.</div>

<p>Still, with all the tortures and punishments allowed by the
law, and all the cruelties superadded upon the criminals by
irritated officers or rapacious underlings and jailors, a broad
survey of Chinese legislation, judged by its results and the general
appearance of society, gives the impression of an administration
far superior to other Asiatic countries. A favorable comparison
has been made in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> “By far
the most remarkable thing in this code is its great reasonableness,
clearness, and consistency, the business-like brevity and
directness of the various provisions, and the plainness and moderation
in which they are expressed. There is nothing here of
the monstrous <em>verbiage</em> of most other Asiatic productions, none
of the superstitious deliration, the miserable incoherence, the
tremendous <i>non-sequiturs</i> and eternal repetitions of those oracular
performances&mdash;nothing even of the turgid adulation, accumulated
epithets, and fatiguing self-praise of other Eastern
despotisms&mdash;but a calm, concise, and distinct series of enactments,
savoring throughout of practical judgment and European
good sense, and if not always conformable to our improved
notions of expediency, in general approaching to them more
nearly than the codes of most other nations. When we pass,
indeed, from the ravings of the Zendavesta or the Puranas to
the tone of sense and business in this Chinese collection, we
seem to be passing from darkness to light, from the drivellings
of dotage to the exercise of an improved understanding; and
redundant and absurdly minute as these laws are in many particulars,
we scarcely know any European code that is at once so
copious and so consistent, or that is so nearly free from intricacy,
bigotry, and fiction. In everything relating to political
freedom or individual independence it is indeed wofully defective;
but for the repression of disorder and the gentle coer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>cion
of a vast population, it appears to be equally mild and
efficacious. The state of society for which it was formed appears
incidentally to be a low and wretched one; but how could
its framers have devised a wiser means of maintaining it in
peace and tranquillity?”</p>

<p>This encomium is to a certain extent just, but the practice of
legislation in China has probably not been materially improved
by the mere possession of a reasonable code of laws, though
some melioration in jurisprudence has been effected.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The infliction
of barbarous punishments, such as blinding, cutting off
noses, ears, or other parts of the body, still not uncommon in
Persia and Turkey, is not allowed or practised in China; and
the government, in minor crimes, contents itself with but little
more than opprobrious exposure in the pillory, or castigation,
which carry with them no degradation.</p>

<p>The defects in this remarkable body of laws arise from several
sources. The degree of liberty that can safely be awarded
to the subject is not defined in it, and his rights are unknown
in law. The government is despotic, but having no efficient
military power in their hands, the lawgivers resort to a minuteness
of legislation upon the practice of social and relative virtues
and duties which interferes with their observance; though it
must be remembered that no pulpit or Sabbath-school exists
there to expound and enforce them from a higher code, and
the laws must be the chief guide in most cases. The code also
exhibits a minute attention to trifles, and an effort to legislate
for every possible contingency, which must perplex the judge
when dealing with the infinite shades of difference occurring in
human actions. There are now many vague and obsolete statutes,
ready to serve as a handle to prosecute offenders for the
gratification of private pique; and although usage and precedent
both combine to prove their disuse, malice and bribery
can easily effect their reviviscence and application to the case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INFLUENCE OF THE LAWS UPON SOCIETY.</div>

<p>Sheer cruelty, except in cases of treason against the Emperor,
cannot be charged against this code as a whole, though
many of the laws seem designed to operate chiefly <i>in terrorem</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
and the penalty is placed higher than the punishment really
intended to be inflicted, to the end that the Emperor may have
scope for mercy, or, as he says, “for leniency beyond the bounds
of the law.” The principle on which this is done is evident, and
the commonness of the practice proves that such an exercise of
mercy has its effect. The laws of China are not altogether unmeaning
words, though the degree of efficiency in their execution
is subject to endless variations; some officers are clement,
others severe; the people in certain provinces are industrious
and peaceable, in others turbulent and averse to quiet occupations,
so that one is likely to form a juster idea of their administration
by looking at the results as seen in the general aspect
of society, and judging of the tree by its fruits, than by drawing
inferences applicable to the whole machine of state from particular
instances of oppression and insubordination, as has been so
often the case with travellers and writers.</p>

<p>The general examination of the Chinese government here
proposed may be conveniently considered under the heads of
the Emperor and his court, classes of society, the different
branches of the supreme administration, the provincial authorities,
and the execution of the laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ATTRIBUTES OF THE CHINESE EMPEROR.</div>

<p>The Emperor is at the head of the whole; and if the possession
of great power, and being the object of almost unbounded
reverence, can impart happiness, he may safely be considered
as the happiest mortal living; though to his power there are
many checks, and the reverence paid him is proportioned somewhat
to the fidelity with which he administers the decrees of
heaven. “The Emperor is the sole head of the Chinese constitution
and government; he is regarded as the vice-gerent of
heaven, especially chosen to govern all nations; and is supreme
in everything, holding at once the highest legislative and executive
powers, without limit or control.” Both he and the Pope
claim to be the vice-gerent of heaven and interpreter of its decrees
to the whole world, and these two rulers have emulated
each other in their assumption of arrogant titles. The most
common appellation employed to denote the Emperor in state
papers and among the people is <i>hwangtí</i>, or ‘august sovereign;’
it is defined as “the appellation of one possessing complete vir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>tues,
and able to act on heavenly principles.”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> This title is
further defined as meaning heaven: “Heaven speaks not, yet
the four seasons follow in regular succession, and all things
spring forth. So the three august ones (Fuhhí, Shinnung, and
Hwangtí) descended in state, and without even uttering a word
the people bowed to their sway; their virtue was inscrutable
and boundless like august heaven, and therefore were they called
<i>august</i> ones.”</p>

<p>Among the numerous titles given the monarch may be mentioned
<i>hwang shang</i>, the ‘august lofty one;’ <i>tien hwang</i>, ‘celestial
august one;’ <i>shing hwang</i>, the ‘wise and august,’ <i>i.e.</i>,
infinite in knowledge and complete in virtue; <i>tien tí</i>, ‘celestial
sovereign;’ and <i>shing tí</i>, ‘sacred sovereign,’ because he is able
to act on heavenly principles. He is also called <i>tien tsz’</i>, ‘son
of heaven,’ because heaven is his father and earth is his mother,
and <i>shing tien tsz’</i>, ‘wise son of heaven,’ as being born of heaven
and having infinite knowledge; terms which are given him as
the ruler of the world by the gift of heaven. He is even addressed,
and sometimes refers to himself, under designations
which pertain exclusively to heaven. <i>Wan sui yé</i>, ‘sire of ten
thousand years,’ is a term used when speaking of him or
approaching him, like the words, <i>O king, live forever!</i> addressed
to the ancient kings of Persia. <i>Pí hia</i>, ‘beneath the
footstool,’ is a sycophantic compellation used by his courtiers,
as if they were only worthy of being at the edge of his
footstool.</p>

<p>The Emperor usually designates himself by the terms <i>chin</i>,
‘ourself;’ <i>kwa jin</i>, the ‘solitary man,’ or the one man; and
<i>kwa kiun</i>, the ‘solitary prince.’ He has been loaded with many
ridiculous titles by foreign writers, as Brother of the Sun and
Moon, Grandson of the Stars, King of Kings, etc., but no such
epithets are known among his subjects. His palace has various
appellations, such as hall of audience, golden palace, the ninth
entrance, vermilion avenue, vermilion hall, rosy hall, forbidden
pavilion, the crimson and forbidden palace, gemmeous steps,
golden steps, meridian portal, gemmeous avenue, celestial steps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
celestial court, great interior, the maple pavilion, royal house,
etc. To see him is to see the dragon’s face; the throne is called
the “dragon’s throne,” and also the “divine utensil,” <i>i.e.</i>, the
thing given him by heaven to sit in when executing his divine
mission; his person is styled the dragon’s body, and a five-clawed
dragon is emblazoned, like a coat of arms, on his robes,
which no one can use or imitate. Thus the Old Dragon, it
might be almost said, has coiled himself around the Emperor
of China, one of the greatest upholders of his power in this
world, and contrived to get himself worshipped, through him,
by one-third of mankind.</p>

<p>The Emperor is the fountain of power, rank, honor, and
privilege to all within his dominions, which are termed <i>tien hia</i>,
meaning all under heaven, and were till recently, even by his
highest officers, ignorantly supposed to comprise all mankind.
As there can be but one sun in the heavens, so there can be
but one <i>hwangtí</i> on earth, the source and dispenser of benefits
to the whole world.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The same absolute executive power held
by him is placed in the hands of his deputies and governor-generals,
to be by them exercised within the limits of their
jurisdiction. He is the head of religion and the only one
qualified to adore heaven; he is the source of law and dispenser
of mercy; no right can be held in opposition to his pleasure,
no claim maintained against him, no privilege protect from his
wrath. All the forces and revenues of the Empire are his, and
he has a right to claim the services of all males between sixteen
and sixty. In short, the whole Empire is his property, and the
only checks upon his despotism are public opinion, the want of
an efficient standing army, poverty and the venality of the
agents of his power.</p>

<p>When the Manchus found themselves in possession of Peking,
they regarded this position as fully entitling them to assume all
imperial rights. Their sovereign thus announced his elevation
in November, 1644: “I, the Son of Heaven, of the Ta-tsing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
dynasty, humbly as a subject dare to announce to Imperial
Heaven and Sovereign Earth. Though the world is vast,
Shangtí looks on all without partiality. My Imperial Grandfather
received the gracious decree of Heaven and founded a
kingdom in the East, which became firmly established. My
Imperial Father succeeding to the kingdom, extended it; and I,
Heaven’s servant, in my poor person became the inheritor of
the dominion they transmitted. When the Ming dynasty was
coming to its end, traitors and men of violence appeared in
crowds, involving the people in misery. China was without a
ruler. It fell to me reverentially to accept the responsibility
of continuing the meritorious work of my ancestors. I saved
the people, destroyed their oppressors; and now, in accordance
with the desires of all, I fix the urns of Empire at Yen-king....
I, receiving Heaven’s favor, and in accordance with their
wishes, announce to Heaven that I have ascended the throne of
the Empire, that the name I have chosen for it is the Great
Pure, and that the style of my reign is <i>Shun-chí</i> (‘Obedient
Rule’). I beg reverentially Heaven and Earth to protect and
assist the Empire, so that calamity and disturbance may soon
come to an end, and the land enjoy universal peace. For this
I humbly pray, and for the acceptance of this sacrifice.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSONAL NAME AND TITLES OF THE EMPEROR.</div>

<p>The present Emperor is the ninth of the Tsing dynasty who
has reigned in China. <i>Tsing</i> means Pure, and was taken by
the Manchus as a distinctive term for their new dynasty,
alluding to the purity of justice they intended to maintain in
their sway. Some of the founders of the ancient dynasties derived
their dynastic name from their patrimonial estates, as
<i>Sung</i>, <i>Han</i>, <i>Chau</i>, etc., but the later ones have adopted names
like <i>Yuen</i>, or ‘Original,’ <i>Ming</i>, or ‘Illustrious,’ etc., which indicate
their vanity.</p>

<p>The present monarch is still a minor, and the affairs of government
are nominally under the direction of the Empress-dowager,
who held the same office during the minority of his
predecessor, Tungchí. The surname of the reigning family is
<i>Gioro</i>, or ‘Golden,’ derived from their ancestral chief, Aisin
Gioro, whom they feign to have been the son of a divine virgin.
They are the lineal descendants of the Kin, a rude race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
which drove out the Chinese rulers and occupied the northern
provinces about 1130, making Peking their capital for many
years. On the approach of the Mongols they were chased away
to the east, and retained only a nominal independence; changing
their name from Nüchih to Manjurs, they gradually increased
in numbers, but did not assume any real importance until they
became masters of China. The acknowledged founder of the
reigning house was the chief Hien-tsu (1583-1615), whose actual
descendants are collectively designated <i>Tsung-shih</i>, or ‘Imperial
Clan.’ The second Emperor further limited the Clan by
giving to each of his twenty-four sons a personal name of two
characters, the first of which, Yun, was the same for all of
them. For the succeeding generations he ordered a series of
characters to be used by all the members of each, so that
through all their ramifications the first name would show their
position. Kanghí’s own name was <i>Hiuen</i>, then followed <i>Yun</i>,
<i>Hung</i>, <i>Yung</i>, <i>Mien</i>, <i>Yih</i>, and <i>Tsai</i>, the last and present sovereigns
being both named <i>Tsai</i>. All who bear this name are
direct descendants of Kanghí. Since the application of these
seven generation names, eight more have been selected for
future use by imperial scions.</p>

<p>In order still further to distinguish those most nearly allied
in blood, as sons, nephews, etc., it is required that the second
names of each family always consist of characters under the
same radical. Thus Kiaking and his brothers wrote their first
names <i>Yung</i>, and under the radical <i>gun</i> for the second; Taukwang
and his brothers and cousins <i>Mien</i>, and under the radical
<i>heart</i>. For some unexplained reason the radicals <i>silk</i> and <i>gold</i>,
chosen for the second names of the next two generations, were
altered to <i>words</i> and <i>water</i>. This peculiarity is easily represented
in the Chinese characters; a comparison can be made
in English with the supposed names of a family of sons, as
Louis Edward, Louis Edwin, Louis Edwy, Louis Edgar, etc.,
the word <i>Louis</i> answering to <i>Mien</i>, and the syllable <i>Ed</i> to the
radical <i>heart</i>.</p>

<p>The present Emperor’s personal name is Tsai-tien, and, like
those of his predecessors, is deemed to be too sacred to be
spoken, or the characters to be written in the common form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
The same reverence is observed for the names after death, so
that twelve characters have been altered since the Manchu monarchs
began to reign; Hiuen-wa, which was the personal name
of Kanghí, has become permanently altered in its formation.
The present sovereign was born August 15, 1871, and on January
12, 1875, succeeded his cousin Tsaishun, who died without
issue&mdash;the first instance in the Gioro family for nearly three
centuries. At this time there was some delay as to which of
his cousins should succeed to the dragon throne, when the united
council of the princes was led by the mother of the deceased
Emperor to adopt her nephew, the son of Prince Chun. The
little fellow was sent for at night to be immediately saluted
as <i>hwangtí</i>, and ere long brought in before them, cross and
sleepy as he was, to begin his reign under the style of Kwangsü,
or ‘Illustrious Succession.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KWOH HAO AND MIAO HAO.</div>

<p>This title is called a <i>kwoh hao</i>, or national designation, and
answers more nearly to the name that a new Pope takes with
the tiara than to anything else in western lands. It is the expression
of the idea which the monarch wishes to associate with
his reign, and is the name by which he is known to his subjects
during his life. It has been called a <i>period</i> by some
writers, but while it is not strictly his name, yet period is not
so correct as <i>reign</i>. Usage has made it equivalent in foreign
books to the personal name, and it is plainer to say the Emperor
Taukwang than the period Taukwang or the reign Taukwang,
or still more than to write, as Wade has done, “the Emperor
Mien-Ning, the style of whose reign was Tau Kwang;”
or than Legge has done, to say, “the Emperor Pattern, of the
period Yungching.” In such cases it is not worth the trouble to
attempt strict accuracy in a matter so entirely unlike western
usages.</p>

<p>The use of the <i>kwoh hao</i> began with Wăn-tí, of the Han
dynasty,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 179, and has continued ever since. Some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
the early monarchs changed their <i>kwoh hao</i> many times during
their reigns; Kao-tsung (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 650-684), for example, had thirteen
in a régime of thirty-four years, which induced historians
to employ the <i>miao hao</i>, or ancestral name, as more suitable
and less liable to confusion. The reason for thus investing the
sovereign with a title different from his real name is not fully
apparent, but arose probably out of the vanity of the monarch,
who wished thus to glorify himself by a high-sounding title,
and make his own name somewhat ineffable at the same time.
The custom was adopted in Japan about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 645, and is practised
in Corea and Annam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CORONATION PROCLAMATION OF TAUKWANG.</div>

<p>When a monarch ascends the throne, or as it is expressed
in Chinese, “when he receives from Heaven and revolving
nature the government of the world,” he issues an inaugural
proclamation. There is not much change in the wording of
these papers, and an extract from the one issued in 1821 will
exhibit the practice on such occasions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our Ta Tsing dynasty has received the most substantial
indication of Heaven’s kind care. Our ancestors, Taitsu and
Taitsung, began to lay the vast foundation [of our Empire];
and Shítsu became the sole monarch of China. Our sacred
ancestor Kanghí, the Emperor Yungching, the glory of his age,
and Kienlung, the eminent in honor, all abounded in virtue,
were divine in martial prowess, consolidated the glory of the
Empire, and moulded the whole to peaceful harmony.</p>

<p>“His late Majesty, who has now gone the great journey,
governed all under Heaven’s canopy twenty-five years, exercising
the utmost caution and industry. Nor evening nor morning
was he ever idle. He assiduously aimed at the best possible
rule, and hence his government was excellent and illustrious;
the court and the country felt the deepest reverence and the
stillness of profound awe. A benevolent heart and a benevolent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
administration were universally diffused: in China Proper, as
well as beyond it, order and tranquillity prevailed, and the tens
of thousands of common people were all happy. But in the
midst of a hope that this glorious reign would be long protracted,
and the help of Heaven would be received many days,
unexpectedly, on descending to bless, by his Majesty’s presence,
Lwanyang, the dragon charioteer (the holy Emperor) became a
guest on high.</p>

<p>“My sacred and indulgent Father had, in the year that he
began to rule alone, silently settled that the divine utensil
should devolve on my contemptible person. I, knowing the
feebleness of my virtue, at first felt much afraid I should not be
competent to the office; but on reflecting that the sages, my
ancestors, have left to posterity their plans; that his late
Majesty has laid the duty on me&mdash;and Heaven’s throne should
not be long vacant&mdash;I have done violence to my feelings and
forced myself to intermit awhile my heartfelt grief, that I may
with reverence obey the unalterable decree; and on the 27th of
the 8th moon (October 3d) I purpose devoutly to announce the
event to Heaven, to earth, to my ancestors, and to the gods of
the land and of the grain, and shall then sit down on the imperial
throne. Let the next year be the first of Taukwang.</p>

<p>“I look upward and hope to be able to continue former excellences.
I lay my hand on my heart with feelings of respect
and cautious awe.&mdash;When a new monarch addresses himself to
the Empire, he ought to confer benefits on his kindred, and extensively
bestow gracious favors: what is proper to be done
on this occasion is stated below.”</p>

<p>(Here follow twenty-two paragraphs, detailing the gifts to be
conferred and promotions made of noblemen and officers; ordering
the restoration of suspended dignitaries to their full pay
and honors, and sacrifices to Confucius and the Emperors of
former dynasties; pardons to be extended to criminals, and
banished convicts recalled; governmental debts and arrearages
to be forgiven, and donations to be bestowed upon the aged.)</p>

<p>“Lo! now, on succeeding to the throne, I shall exercise myself
to give repose to the millions of my people. Assist me to
sustain the burden laid on my shoulders! With veneration I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
receive charge of Heaven’s great concerns.&mdash;Ye kings and statesmen,
great and small, civil and military, let every one be faithful
and devoted, and aid in supporting the vast affairs, that our
family dominion may be preserved hundreds and tens of thousands
of years in never-ending tranquillity and glory! Promulgate
this to all under Heaven&mdash;cause every one to hear it!”</p></div>

<p>The programme of ceremonies to be observed when the Emperor
“ascends the summit,” and seats himself on the dragon’s
throne, was published for the Emperor Taukwang by the Board
of Rites a few days after. It details a long series of prostrations
and bowings, leading out and marshalling the various officers
of the court and members of the imperial family. After
they are all arranged in proper precedence before the throne,
“at the appointed hour the president of the Board of Rites
shall go and entreat his Majesty to put on his mourning, and
come forth by the gate of the eastern palace, and enter at the
left door of the middle palace, where his Majesty, before the
altar of his deceased imperial father, will respectfully announce
that he receives the decree&mdash;kneel thrice and bow nine times.”</p>

<p>He then retires, and soon after a large deputation of palace
officers “go and solicit his Majesty to put on his imperial robes
and proceed to the palace of his mother, the Empress-dowager,
to pay his respects. The Empress-dowager will put on her court
robes and ascend her throne, before which his Majesty shall
kneel thrice and bow nine times.” After this filial ceremony
is over the golden chariot is made ready, the officer of the
Astronomical Board&mdash;whose business is to <i>observe times</i>&mdash;is
stationed at the palace gate, and when he announces the arrival
of the chosen and felicitous moment, his Majesty comes forth
and mounts the golden chariot, and the procession advances to
the Palace of Protection and Peace. Here the great officers of
the Empire are marshalled according to their rank, and when
the Emperor sits down in the palace they all kneel and bow
nine times.</p>

<p>“This ceremony over, the President of the Board of Rites,
stepping forward, shall kneel down and beseech his Majesty,
saying, ‘Ascend the imperial throne.’ The Emperor shall then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
rise from his seat, and the procession moving on in the same
order to the Palace of Peace, his Majesty shall ascend the seat
of gems and sit down on the imperial throne, with his face to
the south.” All present come forward and again make the
nine prostrations, after which the proclamation of coronation,
as it would be called in Europe, is formally sealed, and then
announced to the Empire with similar ceremonies. There are
many other lesser rites observed on these occasions, some of
them appropriate to such an occasion, and others, according to
our notions, bordering on the ludicrous; the whole presenting
a strange mixture of religion, splendor, and farce, though as a
whole calculated to impress all with a sentiment of awe toward
one who gives to heaven, and receives from man, such homage
and worship.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>



<div class="sidenote">HOMAGE RENDERED TO THE EMPEROR.</div>

<p>Nothing is omitted which can add to the dignity and sacredness
of the Emperor’s person or character. Almost everything
used by him, or in his personal service, is tabued to the common
people, and distinguished by some peculiar mark or color, so as
to keep up the impression of awe with which he is regarded,
and which is so powerful an auxiliary to his throne. The outer
gate of the palace must always be passed on foot, and the paved
entrance walk leading up to it can only be used by him. The
vacant throne, or even a screen of yellow silk thrown over a
chair, is worshipped equally with his actual presence, and an
imperial dispatch is received in the provinces with incense and
prostrations; the vessels on the canal bearing articles for his
special use always have the right of way. His birthday is celebrated
by his officers, and the account of the opening ceremony,
as witnessed by Lord Macartney, shows how skilfully
every act tends to maintain his assumed character as the son of
heaven.</p>

<p>“The first day was consecrated to the purpose of rendering a
solemn, sacred, and devout homage to the supreme majesty of
the Emperor. The ceremony was no longer performed in a
tent, nor did it partake of the nature of a banquet. The princes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
tributaries, ambassadors, and great officers of state were assembled
in a vast hall; and upon particular notice were introduced
into an inner building, bearing at least the semblance of a temple.
It was chiefly furnished with great instruments of music,
among which were sets of cylindrical bells suspended in a line
from ornamental frames of wood, and gradually diminishing in
size from one extremity to the other, and also triangular pieces
of metal, arranged in the same order as the bells. To the
sound of these instruments a slow and solemn hymn was sung
by eunuchs, who had such a command over their voices as to
resemble the effect of musical glasses at a distance. The performers
were directed, in the gliding from one tone to the other,
by the striking of a shrill and sonorous cymbal; and the judges
of music among the gentlemen of the embassy were much
pleased with their execution. The whole had, indeed, a grand
effect. During the performance, and at particular signals, nine
times repeated, all present prostrated themselves nine times,
except the ambassador and his suite, who made a profound
obeisance. But he whom it was meant to honor continued, as
if in imitation of the Deity, invisible the whole time. The
awful impression intended to be made upon the minds of men
by this apparent worship of a fellow-mortal was not to be
effaced by any immediate scenes of sport or gaiety, which were
postponed to the following day.”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The mass of the people are
not admitted to participate in these ceremonies; they are kept
at a distance, and care, in fact, very little about them. In every
provincial capital there is a hall, called <i>Wan-shao kung</i>, dedicated
solely to the honor of the Emperor, and where, three days
before and after his birthday, all the civil and military officers
and the most distinguished citizens assemble to do him the
same homage as if he were present. The walls and furniture
are yellow.</p>

<p>The right of succession is hereditary in the male line, but it
is always in the power of the sovereign to nominate his successor
from among his own children. The heir-apparent is not
commonly known during the lifetime of the incumbent, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
there is a titular office of guardian of the heir-apparent. During
the Tsing dynasty the succession has varied, but the bloody
scenes enacted in Turkey, Egypt, and India to remove competitors
are not known at Peking, and the people have no fear
that they will be enacted. Of the eight preceding sovereigns,
Shunchí was the ninth son, Kanghí the third, Yungching the
fourth, Kienlung the fourth, Kiaking the fifteenth, Taukwang
the second, Hienfung the fourth, and Tungchí the only son.
When Kwangsü was chosen this regular line failed, and thus
was terminated an unbroken succession during two hundred
and fifty-nine years (1616 to 1875), when ten rulers (including
two in Manchuria) occupied the throne. It can be paralleled
only in Judah, where the line of David down to Jehoiachin
(<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1055 to 599) continued regularly in the same manner&mdash;twenty
kings in four hundred and fifty-six years.</p>

<p>In the reign of Kienlung, one of the censors memorialized
him upon the desirableness of announcing his successor, in order
to quiet men’s minds and repress intrigue, but the suggestion
cost the man his place. The Emperor said that the name of
his successor, in case of his own sudden death, would be found
in a designated place, and that it was highly inexpedient to
mention him, lest intriguing men buzzed about him, forming
factions and trying to elevate themselves. The soundness of
this policy cannot be doubted, and it is not unlikely that Kienlung
knew the evils of an opposite course from an acquaintance
with the history of some of the princes of Central Asia or
India. One good result of not indicating the heir-apparent is
that not only are no intrigues formed by the crown-prince, but
when he begins to reign he is seldom compelled, from fear of
his own safety, to kill or imprison his brothers or uncles; for,
as they possess no power or party to render them formidable,
their ambition finds full scope for its exercise in peaceful ways.
In 1861, when the heir was a child of five years, a palace intrigue
was started to remove his custody out of the hands of his mother
into those of a cabal who had held sway for some years, but the
promoters were all executed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IMPERIAL HOUSE AND NOBILITY.</div>

<p>The management of the imperial clan appertains entirely to
the Emperor, and has been conducted with considerable sagac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>ity.
All its members are under the control of the <i>Tsung-jin
fu</i>, a sort of clansmen’s court, consisting of a presiding controller,
two assistant directors, and two deputies of the family.
Their duties are to regulate whatever belongs to the government
of the Emperor’s kindred, which is divided into two
branches, the direct and collateral, or the <i>Tsung-shih</i> and <i>Gioro</i>.
The <i>Tsung-shih</i>, or ‘Imperial House,’ comprise only the lineal
descendants of Tienming’s father, named Hien-tsu, or ‘Illustrious
Sire,’ who first assumed the title of Emperor <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1616.
The collateral branches, including the children of his uncles and
brothers, are collectively called <i>Gioro</i>. Their united number is
unknown, but a genealogical record is kept in the national archives
at Peking and Mukden. The <i>Tsung-shih</i> are distinguished
by a yellow girdle, and the <i>Gioro</i> by a red one; when
degraded, the former take a red, the latter a carnation girdle.
There are altogether twelve degrees of rank in the <i>Tsung-shih</i>,
and consequently some of the distant kindred are reduced to
straitened circumstances. They are shut out from useful careers,
and generally exhibit the evils ensuent upon the system of education
and surveillance adopted toward them, in their low,
vicious pursuits, and cringing imbecility of character. The sum
of $133 is allowed when they marry, and $150 to defray funeral
expenses, which induces some of them to maltreat their wives
to death, in order to receive the allowance and dowry as often
as possible.</p>

<p>The titular nobility of the Empire, as a whole, is a body
whose members are without power, land, wealth, office, or influence,
in virtue of their honors; some of them are more or less
hereditary, but the whole system has been so devised, and the
designations so conferred, as to tickle the vanity of those who
receive them, without granting them any real power. The titles
are not derived from landed estates, but the rank is simply
designated in addition to the name, and it has been a question
of some difficulty how to translate them. For instance, the
title <i>Kung tsin-wang</i> literally means the ‘Reverent Kindred
Prince,’ and should be translated Prince Kung, not Prince of
Kung, which conveys the impression to a foreign reader that
<i>Kung</i> is an appanage instead of an epithet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>The twelve orders of nobility are conferred solely on the
members of the imperial house and clan: 1. <i>Tsin wang</i>, ‘kindred
prince,’ <i>i.e.</i>, prince of the blood, conferred usually on his
Majesty’s brothers or sons. 2. <i>Kiun wang</i>, or ‘prince of a
princedom;’ the eldest sons of the princes of these two degrees
take a definite rank during their father’s lifetime, but the collateral
branches descend in precedence as the generations are
more and more remote from the direct imperial line, until at
last the person is simply a member of the imperial clan. These
two ranks were termed <i>regulus</i> by the Jesuit writers, and each
son of an Emperor enters one or other as he becomes of
age. The highest princes receive a stipend of about $13,300,
some rations, and a retinue of three hundred and sixty servants,
altogether making an annual tax on the state of $75,000 to
$90,000. The second receive half that sum, and inferior grades
in a decreasing ratio, down to the simple members, who each
get four dollars a month and rations. 3 and 4. <i>Beile</i> and
<i>Beitse</i>, or princes of and in collateral branches. The 5th to
8th are dukes, called Guardian and Sustaining, with two subordinate
grades not entitled to enter the court on state occasions.
The 9th to 12th ranks are nobles, or rather generals, in line of
descent. The number of persons in the lower ranks is very
great. Few of these men hold offices at the capital, and still
more rarely are they placed in responsible situations in the
provinces, but the government of Manchuria is chiefly in their
hands.</p>

<p>Besides these are the five ancient orders of nobility, <i>kung</i>,
<i>hao</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>tsz’</i>, and <i>nan</i>, usually rendered duke, count, viscount,
baron, and baronet, which are conferred without distinction on
Manchus, Mongols, and Chinese, both civil and military, and as
such are highly prized by their recipients as marks of honor.
The three first take precedence of the highest untitled civilians,
but an appointment to most of the high offices in the country
carries with it an honorary title. The direct descendant of
Confucius is called <i>Yen-shing kung</i>, ‘the Ever-sacred duke,’
and of Koxinga <i>Hai-ching kung</i>, or ‘Sea-quelling duke;’ these
two are the only perpetual titles among the Chinese, but among
the Manchus, the chiefs of eight families which aided in set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>tling
the crown in the Gioro line were made hereditary princes,
who are collectively called princes of the iron crown. Besides
the above-mentioned, there are others, which are deemed even
more honorable, either from their rarity or peculiar privileges,
and answer to membership of the various orders of the Garter,
Golden Fleece, Bath, etc., in Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIFE IN THE PALACE.</div>

<p>The internal arrangements of the court are modelled somewhat
after those of the Boards, the general supervision being
under the direction of the <i>Nui-wu fu</i>, composed of a president
and six assessors, under whom are seven subordinate departments.
It is the duty of these officers to attend upon the Emperor
and Empress at sacrifices, and conduct the ladies of the
harem to and from the palace; they oversee the households of
the sons of the Emperor, and direct, under his Majesty, everything
belonging to the palace and whatever appertains to its
supplies and the care of the imperial guard. The seven departments
are arranged so as to bear no little resemblance to a
miniature state: one supplies food and raiment; a second is
for defence, to regulate the body-guard when the Emperor
travels; the third attends to the etiquette the members of this
great family must observe toward each other, and brings forward
the inmates of the harem when the Emperor, seated in
the inner hall of audience, receives their homage, led by the
Empress herself; a fourth department selects ladies to fill the
harem, and collects the revenue from crown lands; a fifth
superintends all repairs necessary in the palace, and sees that
the streets of the city be cleared whenever the Emperor, Empress,
or any of the women or children in the palace wish to go
out; a sixth department has in charge the herds and flocks of
the Emperor; and the last is a court for punishing the crimes
of soldiers, eunuchs, and others attached to the palace.</p>

<p>The Emperor ought to have three thousand eunuchs, but the
actual number is rather less than two thousand, who perform
the work of the household. His sons and grandsons are allowed
from thirty down to four, while the iron-crown princes and imperial
sons-in-law have twenty or thirty; all these nobles are
constrained to employ some eunuchs in their establishments, if
not able to maintain the full quota, for show. Most of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
class are compelled to submit to mutilation by their parents
before the age of eight (and not always from poverty), as it
usually insures a livelihood. Some take to this condition from
motives of laziness and the high duties falling to their share if
they behave themselves. From very ancient times certain
criminals have been punished by castration. There is a separate
control for the due efficiency of these servants of the court,
who are divided into forty-eight classes; during the present
dynasty they have never caused trouble. The highest pay any
of them receive is twelve taels a month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POSITION OF THE EMPRESS AND LADIES.</div>

<p>The number of females attached to the harem is not accurately
known; all of them are under the nominal direction
of the Empress. Every third year his Majesty reviews the
daughters of the Manchu officers over twelve years of age, and
chooses such as he pleases for concubines; there are only seven
legal concubines, but an unlimited number of illegal. The latter
are restored to liberty when they reach the age of twenty-five,
unless they have borne children to his Majesty. It is generally
considered an advantage to a family to have a daughter
in the harem, especially by the Manchus, who endeavor to rise
by this backstairs influence.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> To the poor women themselves
it is a monotonous, weary life of intriguing unrest. As soon as
one enters the palace she bids final adieu to all her male relatives,
and rarely sees her female friends; the eunuchs who
take care of her are her chief channels of communication with
the outer world. It may be added, however, that the comforts
and influence of her condition are vastly superior to those of
Hindu females.</p>

<p>In the forty-eighth volume of the <cite>Hwui Tien</cite>, from which
work most of the details in this chapter are obtained, is an account
of the supplies furnished his Majesty and the court.
There should daily be placed before the Emperor thirty pounds
of meat in a basin and seven pounds boiled into soup; hog’s
fat and butter, of each one and one-third pound; two sheep,
two fowls, and two ducks, the milk of eighty cows, and seventy-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>five
parcels of tea. Her Majesty receives twenty-one pounds
of meat in platters and thirteen pounds boiled with vegetables;
one fowl, one duck, twelve pitchers of water, the milk of
twenty-five cows, and ten parcels of tea. Her maids and the
concubines receive their rations according to a regular fare.</p>

<p>The Empress-dowager is the most important subject within
the palace, and his Majesty does homage at frequent intervals,
by making the highest ceremony of nine prostrations before
her. When the widow of Kiaking reached the age of sixty in
1836, many honors were conferred by the Emperor. An extract
from the ordinance issued on this festival will exhibit the
regard paid her by the sovereign:</p>

<p>“Our extensive dominions have enjoyed the utmost prosperity
under the shelter of a glorious and enduring state of felicity.
Our exalted race has become most illustrious under the protection
of that honored relative to whom the whole court looks up.
To her happiness, already unalloyed, the highest degree of
felicity has been superadded, causing joy and gladness to every
inmate of the Six Palaces. The grand ceremonies of the occasion
shall exceed in splendor the utmost requirements of the
ancients in regard to the human relations, calling forth the gratulation
of the whole Empire. It is indispensable that the observances
of the occasion should be of an exceedingly unusual
nature, in order that our reverence for our august parent and
care of her may both be equally and gloriously displayed....
In the first month of the present winter occurs the sixtieth
anniversary of her Majesty’s sacred natal day. At the opening
of the happy period, the sun and moon shed their united genial
influences on it. When commencing anew the revolution of
the sexagenary cycle, the honor thereof adds increase to her
felicity. Looking upward and beholding her glory, we repeat
our gratulations, and announce the event to Heaven, to Earth, to
our ancestors, and to the patron gods of the Empire. On the
nineteenth day of the tenth moon in the fifteenth year of Taukwang,
we will conduct the princes, the nobles, and all the high
officers, both civil and military, into the presence of the great
Empress, benign and dignified, universally placid, thoroughly
virtuous, tranquil and self-collected, in favors unbounded; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
we will then present our congratulations on the glad occasion,
the anniversary of her natal day. The occasion yields a happiness
equal to what is enjoyed by goddesses in heaven; and
while announcing it to the gods and to our people, we will
tender to her blessings unbounded.”</p>

<p>Besides the usual tokens of favor, such as rations to soldiers,
pardons, promotions, advances in official rank, etc., it was ordered
in the eleventh article, “That every perfectly filial son or obedient
grandson, every upright husband or chaste wife, upon proofs
being brought forward, shall have a monument erected, with an
inscription in his or her honor.” Soldiers who had reached the
age of ninety or one hundred received money to erect an honorary
portal, and tombs, temples, bridges, and roads were ordered
to be repaired; but how many of these “exceedingly great and
special favors” were actually carried into effect cannot be
stated.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EMPEROR’S GUARD AND DIVISIONS OF THE PEOPLE.</div>

<p>For the defence and escort of the Emperor and his palaces
there are select bodies of troops, which are stationed within the
<i>Hwang-ching</i> and the capital and at the various cantonments
near the city. The Bannermen form three separate corps, each
containing the hereditary troops of Manchu, Mongol, and enrolled
Chinese, organized at the beginning of the dynasty under
eight standards. Their flags are triangular, a plain yellow,
white, red, and blue for troops in the left wing, and the same
bordered with a narrow stripe of another color for troops in the
right wing. All the families of these soldiers remain in the
corps into which they were born.</p>

<p>Two special forces are selected, one named the Vanguard
Division, the other the Flank Division, from the Manchu and
Mongol Bannermen; these guard the Forbidden City, form his
Majesty’s escort when he goes out, and number respectively
about one thousand five hundred and fifteen thousand men.
For the preservation of the peace of the capital a force of upward
of twenty thousand, called the Infantry Division, or Gendarmerie,
is stationed in and around the walls, in addition to
the palace forces. Besides these a cadet corps of five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
young men armed with bows and spears, two battalions with
firearms, and four larger battalions of eight hundred and seventy-five
men each, drilled in rifle-practice, are relied on to aid
the Gendarmerie and Vanguard in case of danger. Whenever
the One Man goes out of the palace gate to cross the city, the
streets through which he passes are screened with matting, to
keep off the crowds as well as diminish the risks of his person.
The result has been that few of the citizens have ever seen their
sovereign’s face during the last two hundred years. The young
Emperor Tungchí obtained great favor among them on one occasion
of his return from the Temple of Heaven by ordering
the screen of mats to be removed so that he and his people
could see each other.</p>

<p>Under the Emperor is the whole body of the people, a great
family bound implicitly to obey his will as being that of heaven,
and possessing no right or property <i>per se</i>; in fact, having
nothing but what has been derived from or may at any time be
reclaimed by him. The greatness of this family, and the absence
of an entailed aristocracy to hold its members or their
lands in serfdom, have been partial safeguards against excess
of oppression. Liberty is unknown among the people; there is
not even a word for it in the language. No acknowledgment
on the part of the sovereign of certain well-understood rights
belonging to the people has ever been required, and is not
likely to be demanded or given by either party until the Gospel
shall teach them their respective rights and duties. Emigration
abroad, and even removal from one part of the Empire
to another, are prohibited or restrained by old laws, but at present
no real obstacle exists to changing one’s place of residence or
occupation. Notwithstanding the fact that Chinese society is so
homogeneous when considered as distinct from the sovereign,
inequalities of many kinds are constantly met with, some growing
out of birth or property, others out of occupation or merit,
but most of them derived from official rank. There is no caste
as in India, though the attempt to introduce the miserable system
was vainly made by Wăn-tí about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 590. The ancient
distinctions of the Chinese into scholars, agriculturists, artisans,
and traders is far superior to that of Zoroaster into priests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
warriors, agriculturists, and artisans; a significant index of the
different polities of eastern and western Asiatic nations is contained
in this early quaternary division, and the superiority of
the Chinese in its democratic element is also noticeable. There
are local prejudices against associating with some portions of
the community, though the people thus shut out are not remnants
of old castes. The <i>tankia</i>, or boat-people, at Canton
form a class in some respects beneath the other portions of the
community, and have many customs peculiar to themselves.
At Ningpo there is a degraded set called <i>to min</i>, amounting to
nearly three thousand persons, with whom the people will not
associate. The men are not allowed to enter the examinations
or follow an honorable calling, but are play-actors, musicians,
or sedan-bearers; the women are match-makers or female barbers
and are obliged to wear a peculiar dress, and usually go
abroad carrying a bundle wrapped in a checkered handkerchief.
The <i>tankia</i> at Canton also wear a similar handkerchief on their
head, and do not cramp their feet. The <i>to min</i> are supposed to
be descendants of the Kin, who held northern China in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
1100, or of native traitors who aided the Japanese, in 1555-1563,
in their descent upon Chehkiang. The <i>tankia</i> came
from some of the Miaotsz’ tribes so early that their origin is
unknown.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>The modern classifications of the people, recognized, however,
more by law than custom, are various and comprehensive.
First, natives and aliens; the latter include the unsubdued
mountaineers and aboriginal tribes living in various parts, races
of boat-people on the coasts, and all foreigners residing within
the Empire, each of whom are subject to particular laws. Second,
conquerors and conquered; having reference almost entirely
to a prohibition of intermarriages between Manchus and
Chinese. Third, freemen and slaves; every native is allowed to
purchase slaves and retain their children in servitude, and free
persons sometimes forfeit their freedom on account of their
crimes, or mortgage themselves into bondage. Fourth, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
honorable and the mean, who cannot intermarry without the
former forfeiting their privileges; the latter comprise, besides
aliens and slaves, criminals, executioners, police-runners, actors,
jugglers, beggars, and all other vagrant or vile persons, who are
in general required to pursue for three generations some honorable
and useful employment before they are eligible to enter
the literary examinations. These four divisions extend over
the whole body of the people, but really affect only a small
minority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SLAVES AND PRIVILEGED CLASSES.</div>

<p>It is worthy of note how few have been the slaves in China,
and how easy has been their condition in comparison with what
it was in Greece and Rome. Owing chiefly to the prevalence of
education in the liberal principles of the Four Books, China has
been saved from this disintegrating element. The proportion of
slaves to freemen cannot be stated, but the former have never
attracted notice by their numbers nor excited dread by their
restiveness. Girls are more readily sold than boys; at Peking a
healthy girl under twelve years brings from thirty to fifty taels,
rising to two hundred and fifty or three hundred for one of seventeen
to eighteen years old. In times of famine orphans or
needy children are exposed for sale at the price of a few cash.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EIGHT HONORARY RANKS.</div>

<p>There are also eight privileged classes, of which the privileges
of imperial blood and connections and that of nobility are the
only ones really available; this privilege affects merely the
punishment of offenders belonging to either of the eight classes.
The privilege of imperial blood is extended to all the blood relations
of the Emperor, all those of the Empress-mother and
grandmother within four degrees, of the Empress within three,
and of the consort of the crown prince within two. Privileged
noblemen comprise all officers of the first rank, all of the second
holding office, and all of the third whose office confers a command.
These ranks are distinct from titles of nobility, and are
much thought of by officers as honorary distinctions. There are
nine, each distinguished by a different colored ball placed on
the apex of the cap, by a peculiar emblazonry of a bird for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
civilians and a beast for military officers on the breast, and a
different clasp to the girdle.</p>

<p>Civilians of the first rank wear a precious ruby or transparent
red stone; a Manchurian crane is embroidered on the back and
breast of the robe, while the girdle clasp is jade set in rubies;
military men have a unicorn, their buttons and clasps being the
same as civilians.</p>

<p>Civilians of the second rank wear a red coral button, a robe
embroidered with a golden pheasant, and a girdle clasp of gold
set in rubies; the lion of India is emblazoned on the military.</p>

<p>Civilians of the third rank carry a sapphire and one-eyed
peacock’s feather, a robe with a peacock worked on the breast,
and a clasp of worked gold; military officers have a leopard.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Different Styles of Official Caps.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Civilians of the fourth rank are distinguished by a blue
opaque stone, a wild goose on the breast, and a clasp of worked
gold with a silver button; military officers carry a tiger in place
of the embroidered wild goose.</p>

<p>Civilians of the fifth rank are denoted by a crystal button, a
silver pheasant on the breast, and a clasp of plain gold with a
silver button; the bear is the escutcheon of military men.</p>

<p>Civilians of the sixth rank wear an opaque white shell button,
a blue plume, an egret worked on the breast, and a mother-of-pearl
clasp; military men wear a tiger-cat.</p>

<p>Civilians of the seventh rank have a plain gold button, a
mandarin duck on the breast, and a clasp of silver; a mottled
bear designates the military, as it also does in the last rank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>The eighth rank wear a worked gold button, a quail on the
breast, and a clasp of clear horn; military men have a seal.</p>

<p>The ninth rank are distinguished by a worked silver button,
a long-tailed jay on the breast, and a clasp of buffalo’s horn;
military men are marked by a rhinoceros embroidered on the
robe. All under the ninth can embroider the oriole on their
breasts, and unofficial Hanlin take the egret.</p>

<p>The mass of people show their democratic tendencies in many
ways, some of them conservative and others disorganizing.
They form themselves into clans, guilds, societies, professions,
and communities, all of which assist them in maintaining their
rights, and give a power to public opinion it would not otherwise
possess. Legally, every subject is allowed access to the
magistrates, secured protection from oppression, and can appeal
to the higher courts, but these privileges are of little avail if he
is poor or unknown. He is too deeply imbued with fear and
too ignorant of his rights to think of organized resistance; his
mental independence has been destroyed, his search after truth
paralyzed, his enterprise checked, and his whole efforts directed
into two channels, viz., labor for bread and study for office.
The people of a village, for instance, will not be quietly robbed
of the fruits of their industry; but every individual in it may
suffer multiplied insults, oppressions, and cruelties, without
thinking of combining with his fellows to resist. Property is
held by a tolerably secure tenure, but almost every other right
and privilege is shamefully trampled on.</p>

<p>Although there is nominally no deliberative or advisatory
body in the Chinese government, and nothing really analogous
to a congress, parliament, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tiers état</i>, still necessity and law
compel the Emperor to consult and advise with the heads of
tribunals. There are two imperial councils, which are the organs
of communication between the head and the body politic;
these are the Cabinet, or Imperial Chancery, and the Council of
State; both of them partake of a deliberative character, but the
first has the least power. Subordinate to these two councils
are the administrative parts of the supreme government, consisting
of the six Boards, the Colonial Office, Censorate, Courts
of Representation and Appeal, and the Imperial Academy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
making in all thirteen principal departments, each of which will
require a short description. It need hardly be added that there
is nothing like an elective body in any part of the system; such
a feature would be almost as incongruous to a Chinese as the
election of a father by his family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NUI KOH, OR CABINET.</div>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Nui Koh</span>, or Cabinet, sometimes called the Grand Secretariat,
consists of four <i>ta hioh-sz’</i>, or principal, and two <i>hiehpan
ta hioh-sz’</i>, or ‘joint assistant chancellors,’ half of them Manchus
and half Chinese. Their duties, according to the Imperial
Statutes, are to “deliberate on the government of the Empire,
proclaim abroad the imperial pleasure, regulate the canons
of state, together with the whole administration of the great
balance of power, thus aiding the Emperor in directing the
affairs of state.” Subordinate to these six chancellors are six
grades of officers, amounting in all to upward of two hundred
persons, of whom more than half are Manchus. Under the six
Chancellors are ten assistants, called <i>hioh-sz’</i>, ‘learned scholars;’
some of the sixteen are constantly absent in the provinces or
colonies, when their places are supplied by substitutes. What
in other countries is performed by one person as prime minister,
is in China performed by the four chancellors, of whom
the first in the list is usually considered to be the premier,
though perhaps the most influential man and the real leader of
government holds another station.</p>

<p>The most prominent daily business of the Cabinet is to
receive imperial edicts and rescripts, present memorials, lay before
his Majesty the affairs of the Empire, procure his instructions
thereon, and forward them to the appropriate office to
be copied and promulgated. In order to expedite business in
court, it is the custom, after the ministers have read and formed
an opinion upon each document, to fasten a slip of paper at the
foot&mdash;or more than one if elective answers are to be given&mdash;and
thus present the document to his Majesty, in the presence-chamber,
who, with a stroke of his pencil on the answer he
chooses, decides its fate. The papers, having been examined
and arranged, are submitted to the sovereign at daylight on the
following morning; one of the six Manchu <i>hioh-sz’</i> first reads
each document and hands it over to one of the four Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
<i>hioh-sz’</i>, who inscribes the answer dictated by the sovereign, or
hands it to him to perform that duty with the vermilion pencil.
By this arrangement a large amount of business can be summarily
despatched; but it is also evident that much depends
upon the manner in which the answer written upon the slip is
drawn up, as to the reception or rejection of the paper, though
care has been taken in this particular by requiring that codicils
be prepared showing the reasons for each answer. The appointment,
removal, and degradation of all officers throughout his vast
dominions, orders respecting the apportionment or remittal of
the revenue and taxes, disposition of the army, regulation of the
nomadic tribes&mdash;in short, all concerns, from the highest appointments
and changes down to petty police cases of crime, are in
this way brought to the notice and action of the Emperor.</p>

<p>Besides these daily duties there are additional functions devolving
upon the members of the Cabinet, who are likewise all
attached to other bureaus, such as presiding on all state occasions
and sacrifices, coronations, reception of embassies, etc.;
these duties are fulfilled by the ten assistant <i>hioh-sz’</i>, who are
all vice-presidents of the Board of Rites. They are the keepers
of the twenty-five seals of government, each of which is of a
different form and used for different and special purposes,
according to the custom of orientals, who place so much dependence
upon the seal for vouching for the authenticity of a
document.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Attached to the Cabinet are ten subordinate offices,
one of which is for translating documents into the various
languages found in the Empire. The higher members of the
Cabinet are familiarly called <i>koh lao</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, elders of the council-room,
from which the word <i>colao</i>, often met with in old books
upon China, is derived.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">THE KIUN-KÍ, OR GENERAL COUNCIL.</div>

<p>2. The <span class="smcap">Kiun-kí Chu</span>, Council of State or General Council,
was organized about 1730, but has now become the most influential
body in the government; and, though quite unlike in its
construction, corresponds to the <i>ministry</i> of western nations,
more than does any other branch of the Chinese system. It
can be composed of any grandees, as princes of the blood, chancellors,
presidents and vice-presidents of the Six Boards, and
chief officers of all the other metropolitan courts. They are
selected at the Emperor’s pleasure, and unitedly called “great
ministers directing the machinery of the army”&mdash;the army
being here taken to signify the nation. Its duties are “to write
imperial edicts and decisions, and determine such things as are
of importance to the army and nation, in order to aid the sovereign
in regulating the machinery of affairs.” The number of
members of the General Council probably varies according to
his Majesty’s pleasure, for no list of them is given in the <cite>Red
Book</cite>; but latterly their number has been four, two of each
nationality, and Prince Kung as the president. This body is
one of the mainsprings of the government, and its composition
shows the tendency of the national councils and polity.</p>

<p>The members of the General Council assemble daily in the
Forbidden Palace, between five and six in the morning; when
summoned by his Majesty into the council-chamber they sit
upon mats or low cushions, no person being permitted to sit on
chairs in the real or supposed presence of the Emperor. His
Majesty’s commands being written down by them, are, if public,
transmitted to the Inner Council to be promulgated; but
on any matter requiring secrecy or expedition, a despatch is
forthwith made up and sent under cover to the Board of War,
to be forwarded. In all important consultations or trials this
Council, either alone or in connection with the appropriate
court, is called in; and in time of war it is formed into a committee
of ways and means. Lists of officers entitled to promotion
are kept by it, and the names of proper persons to supply
vacancies furnished the Emperor. Many of the residents in
the colonies are members of the Council, and communicate
directly with his Majesty through it, and receive allowances
and gifts with great formality from the throne&mdash;a device of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
statecraft designed to maintain an awe of the imperial character
and name as much as possible among the mixed races under them.</p>

<p>The General Council fills an important station in the system,
and tends greatly to consolidate the various branches of government,
facilitating their harmonious action as well as supplying
the deficiencies of an imbecile, or restraining the acts of a
tyrannical monarch. The statutes speak of various record-books,
both public and secret, kept by the members for noting
down the opinions of his Majesty, and add that there are no
fixed times for audiences, one or more sessions being held daily,
according to the exigencies of the state. Besides these functions,
its members are further charged with certain literary
matters, and three subordinate offices are attached to the Council
for their preparation. One is for drawing up narratives of
important transactions&mdash;a few of those relating to the wars and
negotiations with foreigners since 1839 would be of much interest
now; a second is for translating documents; and the third,
entitled “an office for observing that imperial edicts are carried
into effect,” must be at times rather an arduous task, though
probably its responsibility ends when the despatch goes forward.
An office with this title shows that the Chinese government,
with all its business-like arrangements, is still an Asiatic one.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>The duties of these supreme councils are general, comprising
matters relating to all departments of the government, and serving
to connect the head of the state with the subordinate bodies,
not only at the capital, but throughout the provinces, so that
he can, and probably does to a very great degree, thereby maintain
a general acquaintance with what is done in all parts, and
sooner rectify disorders and malpractices. The rivalry between
their members, and the dislike entertained by the Chinese and
Manchus composing them, cause, no doubt, some trouble to the
Emperor; but this has some effect in thwarting conspiracies
and intrigues. It must not be supposed, however, that every
high officer in the Chinese government is wholly unprincipled,
venal, and intriguing; most of them desire to serve and maintain
their country. The personal character and knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
the monarch has much to do with the efficiency of his government,
and the guidance of its affairs demands constant oversight.
If he allows his ministers to conduct their trusts without
restraint, they soon engross and misuse this power for selfish
ends. In natural sequence every branch feels the fatal laxity,
while its functionaries lose no time in imitating their superiors.
This was the case during the reign of Hienfung, but matters
have much improved under the regency since 1861. In ordinary
times, the daily intercourse between the Emperor of China and
his ministers presents very similar features of confidence, courtesy,
and esteem between them as those seen in western lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PEKING GAZETTE AND SIX BOARDS.</div>

<p>The <cite>King Pao</cite>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘<cite>Metropolitan Reporter</cite>,’ usually called
the <cite>Peking Gazette</cite>, is compiled from the papers presented before
the General Council, and constitutes the principal source
of information available to the people for ascertaining what is
going on in the Empire. Every morning ample extracts from
the papers decided upon or examined by the Emperor, including
his own orders and rescripts, are placarded upon boards in
a court of the palace, and form the materials for the annals of
government and the history of the Empire. Couriers are despatched
to all parts of the land, carrying copies of these papers to
the high provincial officers; certain persons are also permitted
to print these documents, but always without note or change,
and circulate them at their own charges to their customers.
This is the <cite>Peking Gazette</cite>, and such the mode of its compilation.
It is simply a record of official acts, promotions, decrees,
and sentences, without any editorial comments or explanations;
and as such of great value in understanding the policy of government.
It is very generally read and discussed by educated
people in cities, and tends to keep them more acquainted with the
character and proceedings of their rulers than ever the Romans
were of their sovereigns and Senate. In the provinces thousands
of persons find employment by copying and abridging the <cite>Gazette</cite>
for readers who cannot afford to purchase the complete edition.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>
<p>The principal executive bodies under these two Councils are
the <i>Luh Pu</i>, or ‘Six Boards,’ which were modelled on much
the same plan during the ancient dynasties. At the head of
each Board are two presidents, called <i>shang-shu</i>, and four vice-presidents,
called <i>shílang</i>, alternately a Manchu and a Chinese;
and over three of them&mdash;those of Revenue, War, and Punishment&mdash;are
placed superintendents, who are frequently members
of the Cabinet; sometimes the president of one Board is
superintendent of another. There are three subordinate grades
of officers in each Board, who may be called directors, under-secretaries,
and controllers, with a great number of minor
clerks, and their appropriate departments for conducting the
details of the general and peculiar business coming under the
cognizance of the Board, the whole being arranged and subordinated
in the most business-like style. The detail of all the
departments in the general and provincial governments is regulated
in the same manner. For instance, each Board has a
different style of envelope for its despatches, and the papers in
the offices are filed away in them.</p>

<p>3. The <span class="smcap">Lí Pu</span>, or Board of Civil Office, “has the government
and direction of all the various officers in the civil service
of the Empire, and thereby it assists the Emperor to rule all
people;” these duties are further defined as including “whatever
appertains to the plans of selecting rank and gradation, to
the rules of determining degradation and promotion, to the
ordinances of granting investitures and rewards, and the laws
for fixing schedules and furloughs, that the civil service may be
supplied.” Civilians are presented to the Emperor, and all
civil and literary officers throughout the Empire distributed by
this Board. The great power apparently thus entrusted is
shared by the two preceding, whose members are made advisory
overseers of the highest appointments, while the provincial
authorities put men in vacant posts as fast as they are needed.
The danger arising from the arrangement is noticed by Biot<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
as having early attracted criticism.</p>

<p>This Board is subdivided into four bureaus. The first at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>tends
to the distinctions, precedence, promotion, exchanging,
etc., of officers. The second investigates their merits and
worthiness to be recorded and advanced, or contrariwise; ascertains
the character each officer bears and the manner in
which he fulfils his duties, and prescribes his furloughs. The
third regulates retirement from office on account of mourning
or filial duties, and supervises the registration of official names;
it is through this bureau that Hwang Ngăn-tung, the Governor
of Kwangtung, was degraded in 1846 for not resigning his office
on the death of his mother. The fourth regulates the distribution
of titles, patents, and posthumous honors. The Chinese
is the only government that ennobles ancestors for the merits
of their descendants; the custom arose out of the worship paid
them, in which the rites are proportionate to the rank of the
deceased, not of the survivor; and if the deceased parent or
grandparent were commoners, they receive proper titles in consequence
of the elevation of their son or grandson. This custom
is not a trick of state to get money, for commoners cannot
buy these posthumous titles; they can only buy nominal titles
for themselves. The usage, however, offers an unexpected
illustration of the remark of Job, “His sons come to honor, and
he knoweth it not.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOARDS OF REVENUE AND RITES.</div>

<p>4. The <span class="smcap">Hu Pu</span>, or Board of Revenue, “directs the territorial
government of the Empire, and keeps the lists of population in
order to aid the Emperor in nourishing all people; whatever
appertains to the regulations for levying and collecting duties
and taxes, to the plans for distributing salaries and allowances,
to the rates for receipts and disbursements at the granaries and
treasuries, and to the rights for transporting by land and water
are reported to this Board, that sufficient supplies for the country
may be provided.” Besides these duties, it obtains the
admeasurement of all lands in the Empire, and proportions
taxes and conscriptions, according to the divisions, population,
etc., regulates the expenditure, and ascertains the latitude and
longitude of places. One minor office prepares lists of all the
Manchu girls fit to be introduced into the palace for selection
as inmates of the harem, a duty which is enjoined on it because
the allowances, outfits, and positions of these women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
come within its control. The injudicious mode of collecting
revenue common under the Persian and Syrian kings, by which
the sums obtained from single cities and provinces were apportioned
among the royal family and favorites, and carried directly
to them, has never been practised by the Chinese.</p>

<p>There are fourteen subordinate departments to attend to the
receipt of the revenue from each of the provinces, each of
which corresponds with the treasury department in its respective
province. The revenue being paid in sundry ways and
articles, as money, grain, manufactures, etc., the receipt and
distribution of the various articles require a large force of assistants.
This Board is moreover a court of appeal on disputes
respecting property, and superintends the mint in each province;
one bureau is called the “great ministers of the Three
Treasuries,” viz., of metals, silks and dye-stuffs, and stationery.</p>

<p>5. The <span class="smcap">Lí Pu</span>, or Board of Rites, “examines and directs concerning
the performance of the five kinds of ritual observances,
and makes proclamation thereof to the whole Empire, thus
aiding the Emperor in guiding all people. Whatever appertains
to the ordinances for regulating precedence and literary
distinctions, to the canons for maintaining religious honor and
fidelity, to the orders respecting intercourse and tribute, and to
the forms of giving banquets and granting bounties, are reported
to this Board in order to promote national education.”
The five classes of rites are defined to be those of a propitious
and those of a felicitous nature, military and hospitable rites,
and those of an infelicitous nature. Among the subordinate
departments is that of ceremonial forms, which “has the regulation
of the etiquette to be observed at court on all occasions,
on congratulatory attendances, in the performance of official
duties, etc.; also the regulation of dresses, caps, etc.; as to the
figure, size, color, and nature of their fabrics and ornaments, of
carriages and riding accoutrements, their form, etc., with the
number of followers and insignia of rank. It has also the
direction of the entire ceremonial of personal intercourse between
the various ranks or peers, minutely defining the number
of bows and degree of attention which each is to pay to the
other when meeting in official capacities, according as they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
on terms of equality or otherwise. It has also to direct the
forms of their written official intercourse, including those to be
observed in addresses to and from foreign states. The regulation
of the literary examinations, the number of the graduates,
the distinction of their classes, the forms of their selection, and
the privileges of successful candidates, with the establishment
of governmental schools and academies, are all under this department.”</p>

<p>Another office superintends the rites to be observed in worshipping
deities and spirits of departed monarchs, sages, and
worthies, and in “saving the sun and moon” when eclipsed.
The third, called “host and guest office,” looks after tribute
and tribute-bearers, and takes the whole management of foreign
embassies, supplying not only provisions, but translators, and
ordering the mode of intercourse between China and other
states. The fourth oversees the supplial of food for banquets
and sacrifices. The details of all the multifarious ritual duties
of this Board occupy fourteen volumes of the Statutes. “Truly
nothing is without its ceremonies,” as Confucius taught, and no
nation has paid so much attention to them in the ordering of its
government as the Chinese. The <cite>Book of Rites</cite> is the foundation
of ceremonies and the infallible standard as to their
meaning; the importance attached to them has elevated etiquette
and ritualism into a kind of crystallizing force which has
molded Chinese character in many ways.</p>

<p>Connected with the Board of Rites is a Board of Music, containing
an indefinite number of officers whose duties “are to
study the principles of harmony and melody, to compose musical
pieces and form instruments proper to play them, and then
suit both to the various occasions on which they are required.”
Nor are the graces of posture-making neglected by these ceremony-mongers;
but it may with truth be said, that if no
other nation ever had a Board of Music, and required so much
official music as the Chinese, certainly none ever had less real
melody.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PING PU, OR BOARD OF WAR.</div>

<p>6. The <span class="smcap">Ping Pu</span>, or Board of War, “has the duty of aiding
the sovereign to protect the people by the direction of all
military affairs in the metropolis and the provinces, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
regulate the hinge of the state upon the reports received from
the various departments regarding deprivation of, or appointment
to, office; succession to, or creation of, hereditary military
rank; postal or courier arrangements; examination and selection
of the deserving, and accuracy of returns.” The navy
is also under the control of this Board. The management of
the post is confided to a special department, and the transmission
of official despatches is performed with great efficiency and
regularity. A minor bureau of the courier office is called “the
office for the announcement of victories,” which, from a recital
of its duties, appears to be rather a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande vitesse</i>, whose
couriers should hasten as if they announced a victory.</p>

<p>To enable this Board of War to discharge its duties, they are
apportioned under four <i>sz’</i>, or bureaus, severally attending to
promotion for various reasons; to the regulation of the distribution
of rewards and punishments, inspection of troops and
issue of general orders, answering to an adjutant-general’s department;
to the supply and distribution of horses for the cavalry;
and, lastly, to the examination of candidates, preparation
of estimates and rosters, with all the details connected with
equipments and ammunition. The conception of all government
with the Manchus being military and not civil, they have
developed this Board more than was the case during the last
dynasty, the possessions in Central Asia having drawn greatly
on their resources and prowess.</p>

<p>The Household troops and city Gendarmerie have already
been noticed; their control is vested in the <i>Nui-wu Fu</i>, and
the oversight of all the Bannermen in the Empire vests in the
metropolitan office of the <i>Tu-tung</i>, or Captains-general, of whom
there are twenty-four, one to every banner of each race. The
Board of War has no control directly over this large portion of
the Chinese army, and as the direction of the land and sea
forces in each province is entrusted in a great degree to the local
authorities, its duties are really more circumscribed than one
would at first imagine. The singular subordination of military
to civil power, which has ever distinguished the Chinese polity,
makes the study of the army, as at present constituted, a very
interesting feature of the national history; for while it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
often proved inefficient to repress insurrection and defend the
people against brigandage, it has never been used to destroy
their institutions. In times of internal commotion the national
soldiers have usually been loyal to their flag, though it must be
confessed that discipline within the ranks is not so perfect as to
prevent the soldiers from occasionally harassing and robbing
those whom they are set to protect.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BOARDS OF PUNISHMENTS AND WORKS.</div>

<p>7. The <span class="smcap">Hing Pu</span>, or Board of Punishments, “has the government
and direction of punishments throughout the Empire, for
the purpose of aiding the sovereign in correcting all people.
Whatever appertains to measures of applying the laws with
leniency or severity, to the task of hearing evidence and giving
decisions, to the rights of granting pardons, reprieves, or otherwise,
and to the rate of fines and interest, are all reported to
this Board, to aid in giving dignity to national manners.” The
<i>Hing Pu</i> partakes of the nature of both a criminal and civil
court; its officers usually meet with those of the Censorate and
Talí Sz’, the three forming the <i>San Fah Sz’</i>, or ‘Three Law
Chambers,’ which decide on capital cases brought before them.
In the autumn these three unite with members from six other
courts, forming collectively a Court of Errors, to revise the decisions
of the provincial judges before reporting them to his
Majesty. These precautions are taken to prevent injustice
when life is involved, and the system shows an endeavor to secure
a full and impartial consideration for all capital cases,
which, although it may signally fail of its full effect, does the
rulers high credit, when the small value set upon life generally
by Asiatic governments is considered. These bodies are expected
to conform their decisions to the law, nor are they permitted
to cite the Emperor’s own decisions as precedents, without
the law on these decisions has been expressly entered as a
supplementary clause in the code.</p>

<p>It also belongs to sub-officers in the Board of Punishments to
record all his Majesty’s decisions upon appeals from the provinces
at the autumnal assizes, when the entire list is presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
for his examination and ultimate decision, and see that these
sentences are transmitted to the provincial judges. Another
office superintends the publication of the code, with all the
changes and additions; a third oversees jails and jailers; a
fourth receives the fines levied by commutation of punishments,
and a fifth registers the receipts and expenditures. If the administration
of the law in China at all corresponded with the
equity of most of its enactments, or the caution taken to prevent
collusion, malversation, and haste on the part of the judges, it
would be incomparably the best governed country out of Christendom;
but the painful contrast between good laws and wicked
rulers is such as to show the utter impossibility of securing the
due administration of justice without higher moral principles
than heathenism can teach.</p>

<p>The <i>yamun</i> of the <i>Hing Pu</i> in the capital is the most active
of all the Boards, but little is known of what goes on within its
walls. Its prisoners are mostly brought from the provinces,
officers of high rank arrested for malfeasance or failure, and
criminals convicted or condemned there who have appealed to
the highest tribunals. Few of those who enter its gates ever
return through them, and their sufferings seldom end as long as
they have any property left. The narrative of the horrible
treatment endured by Loch and his comrades in 1860, while
confined within this <i>yamun</i>, gives a vivid picture of their sufferings,
but native prisoners are not usually kept bound and pinioned.
In the rear wall of the establishment is an iron door,
through which dead bodies are thrust to be carried away to
burial.</p>

<p>8. The <span class="smcap">Kung Pu</span>, or Board of Works, “has the government
and direction of the public works throughout the Empire, together
with the current expenses of the same, for the purpose of aiding
the Emperor to keep all people in a state of repose. Whatever
appertains to plans for buildings of wood or earth, to the forms
of useful instruments, to the laws for stopping up or opening
channels, and to the ordinances for constructing the mausolea
and temples, are reported to this Board in order to perfect
national works.” Its duties are of a miscellaneous nature, and
are performed in other countries by no one department, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
the plan adopted by the Chinese is not without its advantages.
One bureau takes cognizance of the condition of all city walls,
palaces, temples, altars, and other public structures; sits as a
prize-office, and furnishes tents for his Majesty’s journeys; supplies
timber for ships, and pottery and glassware for the court.
A second attends to the manufacture of military stores and
utensils employed in the army; sorts the pearls from the fisheries
according to their value; regulates weights and measures,
furnishes “death-warrants” to governors and generals; and,
lastly, takes charge of arsenals, stores, camp-equipage, and other
things appertaining to the army. A third department has
charge of all water-ways and dikes; it also repairs and digs
canals, erects bridges, oversees the banks of rivers by means of
deputies stationed at posts along their course, builds vessels of
war, collects tolls, mends roads, digs the sewers in Peking and
cleans out its gutters, preserves ice, makes book-cases for public
records, and, lastly, looks after the silks sent as taxes. The
fourth of these offices confines its attention chiefly to the condition
of the imperial mausolea, the erection of the sepulchres
and tablets of meritorious officers buried at public expense, and
the adornment of temples and palaces, as well as superintending
all workmen employed by the Board.</p>

<p>The mint is under the direction of two vice-presidents, and
the manufacture of gunpowder is specially intrusted to two
great ministers. One would think, from this recital, that the
functions of the Board of Works were so diverse that it would
be one of the most efficient parts of government; but if the
condition of forts, ports, dikes, etc., in other parts of the country
corresponds to those along the coast, there is, as the Emperor
once said of the army, “the appearance of going to war,
but not the reality”&mdash;most of the works being on record, and
suffered to remain there, except when danger threatens, or his
Majesty specially orders a public work, and, what is more important,
furnishes the money.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LÍ FAN YUEN, OR COLONIAL OFFICE.</div>

<p>9. The <span class="smcap">Lí Fan Yuen</span>, or Court for the Government of Foreigners,
commonly called the Colonial Office, “has the government
and direction of the external foreigners, orders their
emoluments and honors, appoints their visits to court, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
regulates their punishments, in order to display the majesty
and goodness of the state.” This is an important branch of the
government, and has the superintendence of all the wandering
and settled tribes in Mongolia, Cobdo, Ílí, and Koko-nor. All
these are called <i>wai fan</i>, or ‘external foreigners,’ in distinction
from the tributary tribes in Sz’chuen and Formosa, who are
termed <i>nui fan</i>, or ‘internal foreigners.’ There are also <i>nui í</i>
and <i>wai í</i>, or ‘internal and external barbarians,’ the former
comprising the unsubdued mountaineers of Kweichau, and the
latter the inhabitants of all foreign countries who do not choose
to range themselves under the renovating influences of the Celestial
Empire. The Colonial Office regulates the government of
the nomads and restricts their wanderings, lest they trespass on
each other’s pasture-grounds. Its officers are all Manchus and
Mongols, having over them one president and two vice-presidents,
Manchus, and one Mongolian vice-president appointed
for life.</p>

<p>Besides the usual secretaries for conducting its general business,
there are six departments, whose combined powers include
every branch necessary for the management of these
clans. The first two have jurisdiction over the numerous tribes
and corps of the Inner Mongols, who are under more complete
subjection than the others, and part have been placed under
the control of officers in Chihlí and Shansí. The appointment
of local officers, collecting taxes, allotting land to Chinese settlers,
opening roads, paying salaries, arranging the marriages,
retinues, visits to courts, and presents made by the princes and
the review of the troops, all appertain to these two departments.
The third and fourth have a similar, but less effectual control
over the princes, lamas, and tribes of Outer Mongolia. At
Urga reside two high ministers, organs of communication with
Russia, and general overseers of the frontier. The oversight of
the lama hierarchy in Mongolia is now completely under the
control of this office; and in Tibet their power has been considerably
abridged. The fifth department directs the actions,
restrains the powers, levies the taxes, and orders the tributary
visits of the Mohammedan begs in the Tien shan Nan Lu, who
are quiet pretty much as they are paid by presents and flattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
by honors. The sixth department regulates the penal discipline
of the tributary tribes. The salaries paid the Mongolian princes
are distributed according to an economical scale. A <i>tsin wang</i>
annually receives $2,600 and twenty-five pieces of silk; a <i>kiun
wang</i> receives about $1,666 and fifteen pieces of silk; and so on
through the ranks of Beile, Beitse, Duke, etc., the last of whom
gets a stipend of only $133 and four pieces of silk. The internal
organization of these tribes is probably the same now as it
was at first among the Scythians and Huns, and partakes of the
features of the feudal and tribal system, modified by the nomadic
lives they are obliged to lead. The Chinese government
is endeavoring to reduce the influence and retinues of the khans
and begs and elevate the people to positions of independent
owners and cultivators of the soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TU-CHAH YUEN, OR CENSORATE.</div>

<p>10. The <span class="smcap">Tu-chah Yuen</span>, or Censorate, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘All-examining
Court,’ is entrusted with the “care of manners and customs, the
investigation of all public offices within and without the capital,
the discrimination between the good and bad performance
of their business, and between the depravity and uprightness
of the officers employed in them; taking the lead of other
censors, and uttering each his sentiments and reproofs, in order
to cause officers to be diligent in attention to their daily duties,
and to render the government of the Empire stable.” The
Censorate, when joined with the Board of Punishments and
Court of Appeal, forms a high court for the revision of criminal
cases and hearing appeals from the provinces; and, in connection
with the Six Boards and the Court of Representation
and Appeal, makes one of the <i>Kiu King</i>, or ‘Nine Courts,’
which deliberate on important affairs of government.</p>

<p>The officers are two censors and four deputy censors, besides
whom the governors, lieutenant-governors, and the governors
of rivers and inland navigation are <i>ex-officio</i> deputy censors.
A class of censors is placed over each of the Six Boards, whose
duties are to supervise all their acts, to receive all public documents
from the Cabinet, and after classifying them transmit
them to the several courts to which they belong, and to make a
semi-monthly examination of the papers entered on the archives
of each court. All criminal cases in the provinces come under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
the oversight of the censors at the capital, and the department
which superintends the affairs of the metropolis revises its
municipal acts, settles the quarrels, and represses the crimes of
its inhabitants. These are the duties of the Censorate, than
which no part of the Chinese government has attracted more
attention. The privilege of reproof given by the law to the
office of censor has sometimes been exercised with remarkable
candor and plainness, and many cases are recorded in history
of these officers suffering for their fidelity, but such instances
must be few indeed in proportion to the failures.</p>

<p>The celebrated Sung, who was appointed commissioner to accompany
Lord Macartney, once remonstrated with the Emperor
Kiaking upon his attachment to play-actors and strong drink,
which degraded him in the eyes of his people and incapacitated
him from performing his duties. The Emperor, highly irritated,
called him to his presence, and on his confessing to the authorship
of the memorial, asked him what punishment he deserved.
He answered, “Quartering.” He was told to select some
other; “Let me be beheaded;” and on a third command, he
chose to be strangled. He was then ordered to retire, and the
next day the Emperor appointed him governor in Ílí, thus
acknowledging his rectitude, though unable to bear his censure.</p>

<p>History records the reply of another censor in the reign of an
Emperor of the Tang dynasty, who, when his Majesty once desired
to inspect the archives of the historiographer’s office, in
order to learn what had been recorded concerning himself,
under the excuse that he must know his faults before he could
well correct them, was answered: “It is true your Majesty has
committed a number of errors, and it has been the painful duty
of our employment to take notice of them; a duty which further
obliges us to inform posterity of the conversation which
your Majesty has this day, very improperly, held with us.”</p>

<p>The censors usually attend on all state occasions by the side
of his Majesty, and are frequently allowed to express their
opinions openly, but in a despotic government this is little else
than a fiction of state, for the fear of offending the imperial ear,
and consequent disgrace, will usually prove stronger than the
consciousness of right or the desires of a public fame and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
martyrdom for the sake of principle. The usual mode of advising
is to send in a remonstrance against a proposed act, as
when one of the body in 1832 remonstrated against the Emperor
paying attention to anonymous accusations; or to suggest
a different procedure, as the memorials of Chu Tsun against
legalizing opium. The number of these papers inserted in the
<cite>Peking Gazette</cite> for the information of the Empire, in many of
which the acts of officers are severely reprehended, shows that
the censors are not altogether idle. In 1833 a censor named Sü
requested the Emperor to interdict official persons at court from
writing private letters concerning public persons and affairs
in the provinces. He stated that when candidates left the
capital for their provincial stations, private letters were sent by
them from their friends to the provincial authorities, “sounding
the voice of influence and interest,” by which means justice
was perverted. The Emperor ordered the Cabinet to examine
the censor and get his facts in proof of these statements, but on
inquiry he either would not or could not bring forward any
cases, and he himself consequently received a reprimand.
“These censors are allowed,” says the Emperor, “to tell me
the reports they hear, to inform me concerning courtiers and
governors who pervert the laws, and to speak plainly about any
defect or impropriety which they may observe in the monarch
himself; but they are not permitted to employ their pencils in
writing memorials which are filled with vague surmises and
mere probabilities or suppositions. This would only fill my
mind with doubts and uncertainty, and I would not know what
men to employ; were this spirit indulged, the detriment of
government would be most serious. Let Sü be subjected to a
court of inquiry.”</p>

<p>The suspension or disgrace of censors for their freedom of
speech is a common occurrence, and among the forty or fifty
persons who have this privilege a few are to be found who do
not hesitate to lift up their voice against what they deem to be
wrong; and there is reason for supposing that only a small portion
of their remonstrances appears in the <cite>Gazette</cite>. With regard
to this department of government, it is to be observed
that although it may tend only in a partial degree to check<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
oppression and reform abuses, and while a close examination of
its real operations and influence and the character of its members
may excite more contempt than respect, still the existence of
such a body, and the publication of its memorials, can hardly
fail to rectify misconduct to some degree, and check maladministration
before it results in widespread evil. The Censorate is,
however, only one of a number of checks upon the conduct of
officers, and perhaps by no means the strongest.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">COURTS OF TRANSMISSION AND JUDICATURE.</div>

<p>11. The <span class="smcap">Tung-ching Sz’</span>, which may be called a Court of
Transmission, consists of a small body of six officers, whose
duty is to receive memorials from the provincial authorities and
appeals from their judgment by the people and present them to
the Cabinet. Attached to this Court is an office for attending
at the palace-gate to await the beating of a drum, which, in conformity
with an ancient custom, is placed there that applicants
may by striking it obtain a hearing. It is also the channel
through which the people can directly appeal to his Majesty,
and cases occur of individuals, even women and girls, travelling
to the capital from remote places to present their petitions for
redress before the throne. The feeling of blood revenge prevails
among the Chinese, and impels many of these weak and
unprotected persons to undergo great hardships to obtain legal
redress, when the lives of their parents have been unjustly
taken by powerful and rich enemies.</p>

<p>12. The <span class="smcap">Ta-lí Sz’</span>, or Court of Judicature and Revision, has
the duty of adjusting all the criminal courts in the Empire, and
forms the nearest approach to a Supreme Court in the government,
though the cases brought before it are mostly criminal.
When the crimes involve life, this and the preceding unite
with the Censorate to form one court, and if the judges are
not unanimous in their decisions they must report their reasons
to the Emperor, who will pass judgment upon them. In a despotic
government no one can expect that the executive officers
of courts will exercise their functions with that caution and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
equity required in Christian countries, but considerable care has
been taken to obtain as great a degree of justice as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HANLIN AND MINOR COURTS.</div>

<p>13. The <span class="smcap">Hanlin Yuen</span>, or Imperial Academy, is entrusted
“with the duty of drawing up governmental documents, histories,
and other works; its chief officers take the lead of the
various classes, and excite their exertions to advance in learning
in order to prepare them for employments and fit them for attending
upon the sovereign.” This body has, it is highly probable,
some similarity to the collection of learned men to whom
the King of Babylon entrusted the education of promising
young men, for although the members of the Hanlin Yuen do
not, to any great degree, educate persons, they are constantly
referred to as the Chaldeans were by Belshazzar. Sir John
Davis likens it to the Sorbonne, inasmuch as it expounds the
sacred books of the Chinese. Its chief officers are two presidents
or senior members, called <i>chwang yuen hioh-sz’</i>, who are
usually appointed for life; they attend upon the Emperor,
superintend the studies of graduates, and furnish semi-annual
lists of persons to be “speakers” at the “classical feasts,” where
the literary essays of his Majesty are translated from and into
Manchu and read before him.</p>

<p>Subordinate to the two senior members are four grades of
officers, five in each grade, together with an unlimited number
of senior graduates, each forming a sort of college, whose duties
are to prepare all works published under governmental sanction;
these persons are subject from time to time to fresh examination,
and are liable to lose their degrees or be altogether
dismissed from office if found faulty or deficient. Subordinate
to the Hanlin Yuen is an office consisting of twenty-two selected
members, who in rotation attend on the Emperor and make a
record of his words and actions. There is also an additional
office for the preparation of national histories.</p>

<p>The situation of a member of the Hanlin is one of considerable
honor and literary ease, and scholars look forward to a station
in it as one which confers dignity in a government where
all officers are appointed according to their literary merit, but
much more from its being the body from which the Emperor
selects his most responsible officers. A graduate of this rank is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
most likely to be nominated to a vacant office, though the possession
of the title does not of itself warrant a place.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>Before proceeding to consider the provincial governments,
notices of some of the other departments not connected with
the general machinery of the state are here in place. The
municipality of Peking has already been mentioned when describing
the capital; it is intimately connected with the general
government and forms an integral part of the machine.
Among the courts not connected with the municipal rule of the
metropolis, nor forming one of the great departments of state,
is <i>Tai-chang Sz’</i>, or ‘Sacrificial Court,’ whose officers “direct
the sacrificial observances and distinguish the various instruments
and the quality of the sacrifices.” Their duties are of
importance in connection with the state religion, and they rank
high among the court dignitaries of the Empire, but as members
of this, possess no power. The <i>Tai-puh Sz’</i>, or Superintendent
of H. I. M.’s Stud, is an office for “rearing horses,
taking account of their increase, and regulating their training;”
large tracts of land beyond the Great Wall are appropriated to
this purpose, and the clerks of this office, under the direction
of the Board of War, oversee the herdsmen and grooms.</p>

<p>The <i>Kwangluh Sz’</i>, or ‘Banqueting House,’ has the charge
of “feasting the meritorious and banqueting the deserving;”
it is somewhat subordinate to the Board of Rites, and provides
whatever is necessary for banquets given to literary graduates,
foreign ambassadors, etc. The <i>Hunglu Sz’</i>, or ‘Ceremonial
Court,’ regulates the forms to be observed at these banquets,
which consist in little else than marshalling the guests according
to their proper ranks and directing them when to make the
<i>kotow</i>, called also <i>san kwei kiu kao</i>, “three kneelings and nine
knockings.” The <i>Kwoh-tsz’ Kien</i>, or ‘National College,’ is a
different institution from the Hanlin Yuen, and intended for
teaching graduates of the lower degrees; the departments of
study are the Chinese language, the classics and mathematics,
each branch having its appropriate teachers, with some higher
officers, both Chinese and Manchu.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>Kin Tien Kien</i>, or ‘Imperial Astronomical College,’ as
might be expected, is much more astrological than astronomical;
its duties are defined to be “to direct the ascertainment of
times and the movements of the heavenly bodies, in order to
attain conformity with the celestial periods and to regulate the
notation of time among men; all things relating to divination
and the selection of days are under its charge.” The preparation
of the almanac, in which, among other things, lucky and
unlucky days are marked for the performance of all the important
acts of life, and astrological and chiromantic absurdities
inserted for the amusement of fortune-tellers and others, the
instruction of a few pupils, and care of the observatory, occupy
most of the time of its officers. It is now of no practical use,
and as the <i>Tung-wăn Kwan</i> develops into a learned and efficient
college, including astronomy and medicine and their
kindred branches, these native Boards will gradually pass
away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RELATION OF THE EMPEROR WITH HIS OFFICIALS.</div>

<p>The other local courts of the capital seem to have been subdivided
and multiplied to a great degree for the purpose of
affording employment to a larger number of persons, especially
Manchus and graduates, so that the Emperor can attach them
to himself and be surer of their support in case of any insurrection
on the part of the people, and also that he may have them
more under his control. The number of clerks and minor
offices in all the general departments of state is doubtless more
numerous than it would be in a European government. In the
mutual relations of the great departments of the Chinese
government the principles of responsibility and surveillance
among the officers are plainly exhibited, while regard has been
paid to such a division and apportionment of labor as would
secure great efficiency and care, if every member of the machine
faithfully did his duty. Two presidents are stationed over each
Board to assist and watch each other, while the two presidents
oversee the four vice-presidents; the president of one Board is
sometimes the vice-president of another; and by means of
the Censorate and the General Council every portion is brought
under the cognizance of several independent officers, whose
mutual jealousy and regard for individual advancement, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
partial desire for the well-being of the state, affords the Emperor
some guarantee of fidelity. The seclusion in which he
lives makes it difficult for any conspirator to approach his person,
but his own fears regarding the management of such an
immense Empire compel him to inform himself respecting the
actions of ministers, generals, and proconsular governors. The
conduct and devotion of hundreds of officers, both civil and
military, during the wars with Great Britain and the suppression
of rebellions within the last thirty years, afford proof
enough that he has attached his subordinates to his service by
some other principle than fear. The total number of civilians
holding office is estimated at about fourteen thousand persons,
but those dependent on the government are many times this
amount.</p>

<p>The rulers of China have contrived the system of provincial
governments in an admirable manner, considering the character
of the people and the materials they had to work with; no better
proof of their sagacity in this respect can be required than
the general degree of good order which has been maintained for
nearly two centuries, and the great progress the people have
made in wealth, numbers, and power. By a well-arranged
plan of checks and changes in the provincial authorities, the
chances of their abusing position and power and combining to
overthrow the supreme government have been reduced almost
to an impossibility; the influence of mutual responsibility
among them does something to prevent outrageous oppression
of the people, by leading one to accuse another of high crimes
in order to exonerate himself or obtain his place. The sons
and relatives of the Emperor being excluded from civil office in
the provinces, the high-spirited and talented native Chinese do
not feel inclined to cabal against the government because every
avenue to emolument and power is filled and closed against them
by creatures and connections of the sovereign; nor when in office
are they disposed to attempt the overthrow of the reigning
family, lest they lose what has cost them many years of toilsome
study and the wealth and influence of friends to attain.
The examination of these pashaliks is furthermore entitled to
notice from the degree of power delegated to their highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
officers, and the shrewd manner in which its exercise has been
circumscribed and rendered amenable to its imperial source.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIGHER PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES.</div>

<p>The highest officers in the provinces are a <i>tsungtuh</i>, lit. ‘general
director,’ or governor-general, and the <i>futai</i> or <i>fuyuen</i>,
‘soother’ or governor. The former is often called a viceroy,
but that term seems to be quite inapplicable when used to denote
an officer within the limits of the state; governor-general, or
proconsul, is more analogous to his duties. A translation of
these and many other Chinese titles does not convey their exact
functions, but in some cases an equivalent is more intelligible
than a translation.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The <i>tsungtuh</i> has rule over two provinces,
or else fills two high offices in one province, while the <i>futai</i> is
placed over one province, either independent of or in subordination
to a <i>tsungtuh</i>, as enumerated in the table on page <a href="#Page_60">61</a>.</p>

<p>An examination of the <cite>Red Book</cite> for 1852 showed that out
of a total of 20,327 names in it, 16,474 were Chinese, 3,295
were Manchus and Mongols, and 558 enrolled Chinese; in the
copy for 1844, out of 12,758 names, 10,463 were Chinese, 1,768
Manchus, and 527 enrolled Chinese; these figures include only
civilians and the employees in Peking. The Eighteen Provinces
have altogether less than two thousand persons in office above
the rank of assistant district magistrate, viz.: 8 governor-generals,
15 governors, 19 treasurers, 18 judges, 17 chancellors, 15
commanders of the forces, including 2 admirals and 1,740 prefects
and magistrates. All those filling the high grades in this
series report themselves to the Emperor twice every month, by
sending him a salutatory card upon yellow paper, enclosed in a
silken envelope; stating, for instance, that ‘Lin Tseh-sü, governor-general
of Liang Kwang, humbly presents his duty to the
throne, wishing his Majesty repose.’ The Emperor replies with
the vermilion pencil, <i>Chin ngan</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Ourself is well.’</p>

<p>The duties of the governor-general consist in the collective
control of all affairs, civil and military, in the region under his
jurisdiction; he occupies, in his sphere, under correction, the
same authority that the Emperor does over the whole Empire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
The <i>futai</i> has a similar control, but in an inferior degree
when there is a <i>tsungtuh</i>, in the more special supervision of the
administrative part of the civil government, as distinguished
from the revenue, gabel, or literary branches.</p>

<p>The departments of the civil government are five, viz.: administrative,
literary, gabel, commissariat, and excise; the first
being also divided into the territorial and financial and the
judicial branches. At the head of the first branch is the <i>pu-ching
sz’</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, regulating-government commissioner), who is
usually called the treasurer; the <i>ngan-chah sz’</i>, or ‘criminal
judge,’ presides over the second. These two officers often unite
their deliberations in the direction of any territorial or financial
business, or the trial of important cases. The literary department
is placed under the direction of an officer selected from
among the members of the Hanlin Academy, called a <i>hioh-ching</i>,
director of learning, or literary chancellor; there are seventeen
of them altogether. The gabel and commissariat are usually
supervised by certain intermediate officers called <i>tao</i>, or <i>taotai</i>,
sometimes termed intendants of circuit, who have other functions
in addition. The excise, or commercial department, is under
<i>kientuh</i>, or superintendents, but the details of these three branches
vary considerably in different provinces. The officers of the excise,
either in the interior or on the coast, are made amenable
to their superiors in the province, but their functions are exercised
in an irregular manner; for the collection of the revenue is
a difficult affair, and mostly entrusted to the local magistrates.</p>

<p>The military government of a province includes both the land
and sea forces. It is under a <i>títuh</i>, or commander-in-chief, of
which rank there are in all sixteen, twelve of them commanding
one arm alone, and four controlling both land and sea forces.
In five provinces the <i>futai</i> is commander-in-chief, and in
Kansuh there are two. Above the <i>títuh</i>, in point of rank but
not of power, are placed garrisons of Manchu Bannermen under
a <i>tsiang-kiun</i>, or general, whose office is conferred, and his
actions directly controlled, by the captains-general in Peking;
he has jurisdiction, usually, only in the city itself, the principal
object of the appointment, apparently, being to check any
treasonable designs of the civil authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>The duties and relations of these various grades with one
another require some further explanation, however, to be understood.
The three officers, <i>tsungtuh</i>, <i>futai</i>, and <i>tsiangkiun</i> (if
there be one), form a supreme council, and unite in deliberating
upon a measure, calling in the subordinate officer to whose department
it particularly belongs, and to whom its execution is
to be committed, the whole forming a deliberative board, though
the responsibility of the act rests with the two highest officers.
By this means the various members of the provincial government
become better acquainted with each other’s character and
plans, though their intercourse is much restricted by precedence
and rivalry. In the provincial courts civilians always take precedence
of military officers; the governor-general and Banner
commander, governor and major-general, the literary chancellor
and collector of customs, rank with each other; then follow the
treasurer, the judge, and other civilians. The authority of the
governor-general extends to life and death, to the temporary
appointment to all vacant offices in the province, to ordering
the troops to any part of it, issuing such laws and taking such
measures as are necessary for the security and peace of the
region committed to his care, or any other steps he sees necessary.
The <i>futai</i> also has the power of life and death, and
attends to appeals of criminal cases; he oversees, moreover, the
conduct of the lower civilians.</p>

<p>Next in rank to the <i>pu-ching sz’</i> and <i>ngan-chah sz’</i>, who always
reside in the provincial capital, are the intendants of circuit,
who are located in the circuits consisting of two or three prefectures
united for this purpose. They are deputies of the two
highest functionaries, and their delegated power often includes
military as well as civil authority, the chief object of their appointment
being to relieve and assist those high functionaries
in the discharge of their extensive duties. Some of the intendants
are appointed to supervise the proceedings of the prefects
and district magistrates; others are stationed at important
posts to protect them, and those connected with foreign trade
at the open ports have no territorial jurisdiction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUBORDINATE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES.</div>

<p>Subordinate to the governors, through the intendants of circuits,
are the prefects or head magistrates of departments, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
<i>chífu</i>, <i>chíchau</i>, and <i>ting tungchí</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘knowers’ of them, according
as they are placed over <i>fu</i>, <i>chau</i>, or <i>ting</i> departments.
It is the duty of these persons to make themselves acquainted
with everything that takes place within their jurisdiction, and
they are held responsible for the full execution of whatever
orders are transmitted to them, all presenting their reports and
receiving their orders through the intendants.</p>

<p>The practical efficiency of the Chinese government in promoting
the welfare of the people and preserving the peace depends
chiefly upon these officers. The people themselves are
prone to quarrel and oppress each other; beggars, robbers,
tramps, and shysters stir up disorders in various ways, and need
wise and vigorous hands to repress and punish them; while all
classes avoid and resist the tax-gatherer as much as is safe. The
proverb, “A <i>chífu</i> can exterminate a family, a <i>chíhien</i> can confiscate
a patrimony,” indicates the popular fear of their power.</p>

<p>The subdivisional parts of departments, called <i>ting</i>, <i>chau</i>, and
<i>hien</i>, have each their separate officers, who report to the <i>chífu</i>
and <i>chíchau</i> above them; these are called <i>tungchí</i>, <i>chíchau</i>, and
<i>chíhien</i>, and may all be denominated district magistrates. The
parts of districts called <i>sz’</i> are placed under the control of <i>siunkien</i>,
circuit-restrainers, or hundreders, who form the last in the
regular series of descending rank&mdash;the last of the “commissioned
officers,” as they might not improperly be called. The
prefects sometimes have deputies directly under them, as the
governor has his intendants, when their jurisdiction is very
large or important, who are called <i>kiunmin fu</i> and <i>tungchí</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
‘joint-knowers.’ The deputies of district magistrates are termed
<i>chautung</i> and <i>chaupwan</i> for the <i>chíchau</i>, and <i>hienching</i> and
<i>chufu</i> for the <i>chíhien</i>; the last also have others called <i>tso-tang</i>
and <i>yu-tang</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, left-tenants and right-tenants.</p>

<p>Besides these assistants there are others, both in the departments
and districts, having the oversight of the police, collection
of the taxes and management of the revenue, care of water-ways,
and many other subdivisions of legislative duties, which
it is unnecessary to particularize. They are appointed whenever
and wherever the territory is so large and the duties so
onerous that one man cannot attend to all, or it is not safe to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
entrust him with them. They have nearly as much power as
their superiors in the department entrusted to them, but none
of them have judicial or legislative functions, and the routine
of their offices affords them less scope for oppression. Nor is it
worth while to notice the great number of clerks, registrars, and
secretaries found in connection with the various ranks of dignitaries
here mentioned, or the multitude of petty subordinates
found in the provinces and placed over particular places or
duties as necessity may require. Their number is very large,
and the responsibility of their proceedings devolves upon the
higher officers who receive their reports and direct their actions.</p>

<p>The common people suffer more from these “rats under the
altar,” as a Chinese proverb calls them, than from their superiors,
because, unlike them, they are usually natives of the place
and better acquainted with the condition of the inhabitants, and
are not so often removed. The fear of getting into their
clutches restrains from evil doings perhaps more than all punishments,
though the people soon complain of high-handed
acts in a way not to be disregarded. One saying, “Underlings
see money as a fly sees blood,” indicates their penchant, as another,
“Cash drops into an underling’s paw as a sheep falls
into a tiger’s jaw,” does the popular notion how to please them.
Each intendant, prefect, and district magistrate has special
secretaries in his office for filing papers, writing and transmitting
despatches, investigating cases, recording evidence, keeping
accounts, and performing other functions. All above the <i>chíhien</i>
are allowed to keep private secretaries, called <i>sz’ ye</i>, who
are usually personal friends, and accompany the officers wherever
they go for the purpose of advising them and preparing
their official documents. The <i>ngan-chah sz’</i> have jailers under
their control, as have also the more important prefects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LITERARY, GABEL, AND REVENUE DEPARTMENTS.</div>

<p>The appointment of officers being theoretically founded on
literary merit, those to whom is committed the supervision of
students and conferment of degrees would naturally be of a
high grade. The <i>hioh-ching</i>, or literary chancellor, of the province,
therefore ranks next to the governor, more, however, because
he is specially appointed by his Majesty and oversees this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
branch of the government, than from the power committed to
his hands. Under him are head-teachers of different degrees
of authority, residing in the chief towns of departments and
districts, the whole forming a similar series of functionaries to
what exists in the civil department. These subordinates have
merely a greater or less degree of supervision over the studies of
students, and the colleges established for the promotion of learning
in the chief towns of departments. The business of conferring
the lower degrees appertains exclusively to the chancellor,
who makes an annual circuit through the province for that purpose,
and holds examinations in the chief town of each department,
to which all students residing within its limits can come.</p>

<p>The gabel, or salt department, is under the control of a special
officer, called a “commissioner for the transport of salt,”
and forming in the five maritime provinces one of the <i>san sz’</i>, or
three commissioners, of which the <i>pu-ching sz’</i> and <i>ngan-chah sz’</i>
are the other two. There are, above these commissioners, eight
directors of the salt monopoly, stationed at the dépôts in Chihlí
and Shantung, who, however, also fill other offices, and have
rather a nominal responsibility over the lower commissioners.
The number and rank of the officers connected with the salt
monopoly show its importance, and is proof of how large a revenue
is derived from an article which will bear such an expensive
establishment. At present its administration costs about
as much as its receipts.</p>

<p>The commissariat and revenue department is unusually large
in China compared with other countries, for the plan of collecting
any part of the revenue in kind necessarily requires numerous
vehicles for transporting and buildings for storing it, which
still further multiplies the number of clerks and hands employed.
The transportation of grain along the Yangtsz’ River is under
the control of a <i>tsungtuh</i>, who also oversees the disposal and
directs the collectors of it in eight of the provinces adjacent to
this river. The office of <i>liang-chu tao</i>, or commissioner to collect
grain, is found in twelve provinces, the <i>pu-ching sz’</i> attending
to this duty in six; the supervision of the subordinate
agents of this department in the several districts is in the hands
of the prefects and district magistrates. That feature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
Chinese system which makes officers mutually responsible, seems
to lead the superior powers to confer such various duties upon
one functionary, in order that he may thus have a general
knowledge of what is going on about and under him, and report
what he deems amiss. It is not, indeed, likely that such was the
original arrangement, for the Chinese government has come to
its present composition by slow degrees; but such is, so far as
can be seen, the effect of it, and it serves in no little degree to
accomplish the designs of the rulers to bind the main and lesser
wheels of the huge machine to themselves and to one another.</p>

<p>The customs and excise are under the management of different
grades of officers according to the importance of their posts.
The transit duties levied at the excise stations placed in every
town are collected by officers acting under the local authorities,
and have nothing to do with the collection of maritime duties.
This tax, called <i>li-kin</i>, or ‘a cash a catty,’ has lately been
greatly increased, and the natural result has been to destroy the
trade it preyed on, or divert it to other channels. The foreign
merchants and officers have, too, protested against its imposition,
seeing that their trade was checked.</p>

<p>Recapitulating in tabular form, we may say that outside of
the Cabinet, Council, Boards, and Courts at the capital, the
government (in the Eighteen Provinces) is in the hands of:</p>

<div class="sidenote">MILITARY AND NAVAL DEPARTMENTS.</div>

<p>The military section of the provincial governments is under
the control of a <i>títuh</i>, or major-general, who resides at a central
post, and, in conjunction with the governor-general and
governor, directs the movements of the forces, while these last
have also an independent control over a certain body of troops
belonging to them officially. The various grades of officers in
the native army, and the portion of troops under each of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
stationed in the garrisons and forts in different parts of the
provinces, are all arranged in a methodical manner, which will
bear examination and comparison with the army of any country
in the world. The native force in each province is distinct
from the Manchu troops, and is divided somewhat according to
the Roman plan of legion, cohort, maniple, and century, over
each of which are officers, from colonel down to sergeant.
Nothing is wanting to the Chinese army to make it fully adequate
to the defence of the country but discipline and confidence
in itself; for lack of practice and systematic drilling have made
it an army of paper warriors against a resolute enemy. Nevertheless,
the recent campaigns against the rebels in the extreme
western colonies indicate the fact that its regeneration is already
of some weight. On the other hand, it has no doubt been for
the good of the Chinese people and government&mdash;the advance
of the first in wealth, numbers, and security, and the consolidation
and efficiency of the latter&mdash;that they have cultivated letters
rather than arms, peace more than war.</p>

<p>All the general officers in the army have fixed places of residence,
at which the larger portion of their respective brigades
remain, while detachments are stationed at various points within
their command. The governor, major-general, and Banner
commandant have commands independent of each other, but
the <i>títuh</i>, or major-general, exercises the principal military sway.
The naval officers have the same names as those in the army,
and the two are interchanged and promoted from one service to
the other. Admirals and vice-admirals usually reside on shore,
and despatch their subordinates in squadrons or single vessels
wherever occasion requires. This system must, ere long, give
place to a better division of the two arms with the building of
steam vessels and management of arsenals, when junks are
superseded.</p>

<p>The system of mutually checking the provincial officers is
also exhibited in their location. For example, in the city of
Canton the governor-general is stationed in the New city near
the collector of customs, while the lieutenant-governor and
Manchu general are so located in the Old city that should circumstances
require they can act against the two first. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
governor has the general command of all the provincial troops,
estimated to be one hundred thousand men, but the particular
command of only five thousand, and they are stationed fifty
miles off, at Shauking fu. The <i>tsiang kiun</i> has five thousand
men under him in the Old city, which, in an extreme case,
would make him master of the capital, while his own allegiance
is secured by the antipathy between the Manchus and Chinese
preventing him from combining with the latter. Again, the
governor-general has the power of condemning certain criminals
to death, but the <i>wang-ming</i>, or death-warrant, is lodged
with the <i>futai</i>, and the order for execution must be countersigned
by him; his despatches to court must be also countersigned
by his coadjutor. The general absence of resistance to
the imperial sway on the part of these high officers during the
two centuries of Manchu rule, when compared with the multiplied
intrigues and rebellions of the pashas in the Turkish
Empire, proves how well the system is concocted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRAVELLING DEPUTIES AND COMMISSIONERS.</div>

<p>In order to enable the superior officers to exercise greater
vigilance over their inferiors, they have the privilege of sending
special messengers, invested with full power, to every part
of their jurisdiction. The Emperor himself never visits the
provinces judicially, nor has an Emperor been south of the
capital during the present century; he therefore constantly
sends commissioners or legates, called <i>kinchai</i>, to all parts of the
Empire, ostensibly entrusted with the management of a particular
business, but required also to take a general surveillance of
what is going on. The ancient Persians had a similar system
of commissioners, who were called the eyes and ears of the
prince, and made the circuit of the empire to oversee all that
was done. There are many points of resemblance between the
structure of these two ancient monarchies, the body of councillors
who assisted the prince in his deliberations, the presidents
over the provinces, the satraps, etc.; but the Persians had not
the elements of perpetuity which the system of common schools
and official examinations give to the Chinese government.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>
<p>Governors in like manner send their deputies and agents,
called <i>weiyuen</i>, over the province; and even the prefects and
intendants despatch their messengers. All these functionaries,
during the time of their mission, take rank with the highest
officers according to the quality of their employers; but the
imperial commissioners, who for one object or another are constantly
passing and repassing through the Empire in every
direction, exercise great influence in the government, and are
powerful agents in the hands of the Emperor for keeping his
proconsuls at their duty.</p>

<span class="smaller">ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAWS.</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">CHECKS PLACED UPON OFFICE-HOLDERS.</div>

<p>The preceding chapter contains a general view of the plan
upon which the central and provincial governments of the Empire
are constructed; and if an examination of the conduct of
officers in every department shows their extortion, cruelty, and
venality, it will not, in the opinion of the liberal-minded reader,
detract from the general excellence of the theory of the government,
and the sagacity exhibited in the system of checks
designed to restrain the various parts from interfering with the
well-being of the whole. In addition to the division of power
and the restrictions upon Chinese officers already mentioned,
there are other means adopted in their location and alternation
to prevent combination and resistance against the head of the
state. One of them is the law forbidding a man to hold any
civil office in his native province, which, besides stopping all
intrigue where it would best succeed, has the further effect of
congregating aspirants for office at Peking, where they come in
hope of obtaining some post, or of succeeding in the examination
for the highest literary degrees. The central government
could not contrive a better plan for bringing all the ambitious
and talented men in the country under its observation before
appointing them to clerkships in the capital, or scattering them
in the provinces.</p>

<p>Moreover, no officer is allowed to marry in the jurisdiction
under his control, nor own land in it, nor have a son, brother,
or near relative holding office under him; and he is seldom
continued in the same station or province for more than three
or four years. Manchus and Chinese are mingled together in
high stations, and obligations are imposed on certain grandees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
to inform the Emperor of each other’s acts. Members of the
imperial clan are required to attend the meetings of the Boards
at the capital, and observe and report what they deem amiss or
of interest to the Emperor and his council; while in all the
upper departments of the general and provincial governments,
a system of espionage is carried out, detrimental to all principles
of honorable fidelity, such as we look for in officials, but
not without some good effects in a weak despotism like China.
There is, besides this constant surveillance, a triennial catalogue
made out of the merits and demerits of all officers in the Empire,
which is submitted to imperial inspection by the Board of
Civil Office. In order to collect the details for this catalogue,
it is incumbent upon every provincial officer to report upon
the character and qualifications of those under him, and the
list, when made out, is forwarded by the governor to the capital.
The points of character are arranged under six different
heads, viz.: those who are not diligent, the inefficient, the superficial,
the untalented, superannuated, and diseased. According
to the opinion given in this report, officers are elevated or degraded
so many steps in the scale of merit, like school-boys in
a class, and whenever they issue an edict are required to state
how many steps they have been advanced or degraded, and how
many times recorded. Officers are required to accuse themselves,
when guilty of crime, either in their own conduct or
that of their subordinates, and request punishment. The results
of this peculiar and patriarchal mode of teaching officers
their duty will be best exhibited by quoting from a rescript of
Taukwang’s, issued in February, 1837, after one of the catalogues
had been submitted to his Majesty.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The cabinet minister Changling has strenuously exerted himself during a
long lapse of years; he has reached the eightieth year of his age, yet his energies
are still in full force. His colleagues Pwan Shí-ngăn and Muchangah, as
well as the assistant cabinet minister Wang Ting, have invariably displayed
diligence and attention, and have not failed in yielding us assistance. Tang
Kin-chau, president of the Board of Office, has knowledge and attainments of
a respectable and sterling character, and has shown himself public-spirited
and intelligent in the performance of special duties assigned to him. Shí
Chí-yen, president of the Board of Punishments, retains his usual strength and
energies, and in the performance of his judicial duties has displayed perspi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>cacity
and circumspection. The assistant cabinet minister and governor of
Chihlí province, Kíshen, transacts the affairs of his government with faithfulness,
and the military force under his control is well disciplined. Husungé,
the governor of Shensí and Kansuh provinces, is cautious and prudent, and
performs his duties with careful exactness. Ílípu, governor of Yunnan and
Kweichau, is well versed in the affairs of his frontier government, and has
fully succeeded in preserving it free from disturbance. Linking, who is entrusted
with the general charge of the rivers in Kiangnan, has not failed in
his care of the embankments, and has preserved the surrounding districts
from all disquietude. To show our favor unto all these, let the Board of Office
determine on appropriate marks of distinction for them.</p>

<p>“Kweisan, subordinate minister of the Cabinet, is hasty and deficient, both
in precision and capacity; he is incapable of moving and acting for himself; let
him take an inferior station, and receive an appointment in the second class of
the guards. Yihtsih, vice-president of the Board of Works for Mukden, possesses
but ordinary talents, and is incompetent to the duties of his present office;
let him also take an inferior station, and be appointed to a place in the first class
of guards. Narkingé, the governor-general of Hukwang, though having under
him the whole civil and military bodies of two provinces, has yet been unable,
these many days, to seize a few beggarly impish vagabonds: after having in
the first instance failed in prevention, he has followed up that failure by
idleness and remissness, and has fully proved himself inefficient. Let him
take the lower station of governor in Hunan, and within one year let him, by
the apprehension of Lan Ching-tsun, show that he is aroused to greater exertions.</p>

<p>“Let all our other servants retain their present appointments. Among them
Tau Shu, the governor of Kiangnan and Kiangsí, is bold and determined in
the transaction of affairs, but has not yet attained enlarged views in regard to
the salt department; Chung Tsiang, the governor of Fuhkien and Chehkiang,
finds his energies failing; Tăng Ting-ching, the governor of Kwangtung and
Kwangsí, possesses barely an adequate degree of talent and knowledge; and
Shin Kí-hien, though faithful and earnest in the performance of his duties, has,
in common with these others, been not very long in office.</p>

<p>“That all ministers will act with purity and devotedness of purpose, with
public spirit and diligence, is our most fervent hope. A special edict.”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p></div>

<p>The effect of such confessions and examination of character
is to restrain the commission of outrageous acts of oppression;
it is still further enforced by the privilege, common alike to
censors and private subjects, of complaining to the Emperor of
misdeeds done to them by persons in authority. Fear for their
own security has suggested this multiplicity of checks, but the
Emperor and his ministry have no doubt thereby impeded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
efficiency of their subordinates, and compelled them to attend
so much to their own standing that they care far less than they
otherwise would for the prosperity of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF CHINESE OFFICIALS.</div>

<p>The position of an officer in the Chinese government can
hardly be ascertained from the enumeration of his duties, nor
can we easily appreciate, from a general account of the system,
his temptations to oppress inferiors and deceive superiors.
His duties, as indicated in the code, are so minute, and often
so contradictory, as to make it impossible to fulfil them strictly;
it is found, accordingly, that few or none have ascended the
slippery heights of promotion without frequent relapses. Degradation,
when to a step or two and temporary, carries with it
of course no moral taint in a country where the award for bribery
is graduated to the amount received, without any reference
to moral violation; where the bamboo is the standard of punishment
as well for error in judgment or remissness as for crime&mdash;only
commuted to a fine in honor of official rank; where,
as a distinction in favor of the imperial race, the bamboo is
softened to the whip and banishment mitigated to the pillory.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
The highest officers have of course the greatest opportunity to
oppress, but their extortions are limited by the venality and
mendacity of the agents they are compelled to employ. Inferiors
also can carry on a system of exactions if they keep on
the right side of those above them. The whole class form a
body of men mutually jealous of each other’s advance, where
every incumbent endeavors to supplant his associate; they all
agree in regarding the people as the source of their profits, the
sponge which all must squeeze, but differ in the degree to which
they should carry on the same plan with each other. Although
sprung from the mass of the people, the welfare of the community
has little place in their thoughts. Their life is spent
in ambitious efforts to rise upon the fall of others, though
they do not lose all sense of character or become reckless of
the means of advance, for this would destroy their chance of
success. The game they play with each other and their imperial
master is, however, a harmless one compared with what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
done in old Rome or in Europe four or five centuries ago, or
even lately among the pashas and viziers of the sultans and
shahs in Western Asia. To the honor of the Chinese, life is
seldom sacrificed for political crime or envious emulation; no
officer dreads a bowstring or a poisoned cup from his lord paramount,
nor is he on the watch against the dagger of an assassin
hired by a vindictive competitor. Whatever heights of favor
or depths of umbrage he may experience, the servant of the
Emperor of China need not, in unproved cases of delinquency,
fear for his life; but he not unfrequently takes it himself from
conscious guilt and dread of just punishment.</p>

<p>The names and standing of all officers are published quarterly
by permission of government in the <cite>Red Book</cite> (which by an
unusual coincidence is bound in red), called the “Complete Record
of the Girdle Wearers” (<cite>Tsin Shin Tsiuen Shu</cite>), comprised in
four volumes, 12mo, to which are added two others of the Army
and Bannermen. This publication was first issued at the command
of Wanlih, of the Ming dynasty, about 1580, and mentions
the native province of each person, whether Chinese,
Manchu, Mongol, or enrolled Chinese, describes the title of the
office, its salary, and gives much general information. The
publishers of the book expect that officers will inform them of
the changes that take place in their standing, and sometimes
omit to mention those who do not thus report themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAREER OF DUKE HO.</div>

<p>A memoir of the public life of a high officer in China would
present a singular picture of ups and downs, but, on account of
their notorious disregard of truth, Chinese documents are unsafe
to trust entirely in drawing such a sketch. One of the most
conspicuous men in late times was Duke Ho, the premier in the
time of Macartney’s embassy, who for many years exercised a
greater control over the counsels of a Chinese sovereign than is
recorded of any other man during the present dynasty. This
man was originally a private person, who attracted the notice of
the Emperor by his comeliness, and secured it by his zeal in discharging
the offices entrusted to him. With but few interruptions
he gradually mounted the ladder of promotion, and for
some years before Kienlung’s death, when the latter’s energies had
begun to fail from age, was virtual master of the country. Staun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>ton
describes him as possessing eminent abilities; “the manners
of Hokwăn were not less pleasing than his understanding was
penetrating and acute. He seemed indeed to possess the qualities
of a perfect statesman.”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> The favorite had gradually filled the
highest posts with his friends, and his well-wishers were so
numerous in the general and provincial governments that some
began to apprehend a rising in his favor when the Emperor
died. Kiaking, on coming to the throne, began to take those
cautious measures for his removal which showed the great influence
he possessed; one of these proceedings was to appoint
him superintendent of the rites of mourning, in order, probably,
that his official duties might bring him often to the palace.
After four years the Emperor drew up sixteen articles of
impeachment, most of them frivolous and vexatious, though
of more consequence in the eyes of a Chinese prince than they
would have been at other courts. One article alleged that he
had ridden on horseback up to the palace gate; another, that
he had appropriated to his own household the females educated
for the imperial harem; a third, that he had detained the reports
of officers in time of war from coming to the Emperor’s
eye, and had appointed his own retainers to office, when they
were notoriously incompetent; a fourth, that he had built many
apartments of <i>nan-muh</i>, a kind of laurel-wood exclusively appropriated
to royalty, and imitated regal style in his grounds
and establishment; a fifth, that “on the day previous to our
Royal Father’s announcement of our election as his successor,
Hokwăn waited upon us and presented the insignia of the newly
conferred rank&mdash;thereby betraying an important secret of state,
in hopes of obtaining our favor.” He was also accused of having
pearls and jewels of larger size than those even in the Emperor’s
regalia. But so far as can be inferred from what was
published, this Cardinal Wolsey of China was, comparatively
speaking, not cruel in the exercise of his power, and the real
cause of his fall was evidently his riches. In the schedule of his
confiscated property it was mentioned that besides houses, lands,
and other immovable property to an amazing extent, not less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
than one hundred and five millions of dollars in bullion and
gems were found in his treasury. A special tribunal was instituted
for his trial, and he was allowed to become his own executioner,
while his constant associate was beheaded. These were
the only deaths, the remainder of his relatives and dependents
being simply removed and degraded. His power was no doubt
too great for the safety of his master if he had proved faithless;
but his wealth was too vast for his own security, even had he
been innocent. The Emperor, in the edict which contains the
sentence, cites as a precedent for his own acts similar condemnation
of premiers by three of his ancestors in the present dynasty,
but nothing definite is known of their crimes or trials.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Taukwang was more clement, or more fortunate than his
father, and upon coming to the throne continued Tohtsin in
power; this statesman had held the premiership from 1815 to
1832, with but few interruptions, when he was allowed to retire
at the age of seventy-five. He had served under three emperors,
having risen step by step from the situation of clerk in one of
the offices. His successor, Changling, experienced a far more
checkered course, but remained in favor at last, and retired
from the premiership in 1836, aged about seventy-nine. He
became very popular with his master from his ability in quelling
the insurrection of Jehangír in Turkestan in 1827. Even a few
such instances of the honor in which an upright, energetic, and
wise minister is regarded by prince and people have great influence
in encouraging young men to act in the same way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIFE AND CHARACTER OF MINISTER SUNG.</div>

<p>Few Chinese statesmen have been oftener brought into the
notice of western foreigners than Sung, one of the commissioners
attached to Lord Macartney’s embassy, and a favorite of all its
members. His lordship speaks of him then as a young man of
high quality, possessing an elevated mind; and adds that “during
the whole time of our connection with him he has on all occasions
conducted himself toward us in the most friendly and gentleman-like
manner.” This was in 1793. In 1817 he is mentioned
as one of the Cabinet; but not long after, for some unknown
reason, he was degraded by Kiaking to the sixth rank, and ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>pointed
adjutant-general among the Tsakhar Mongols; from
thence he memorialized his master respecting the ill conduct of
some lamas, who had been robbing and murdering. Sung and
his friends opposed the Emperor’s going to Manchuria, and were
involved in some trouble on this account, the reasons of which
it is difficult to understand. He was promoted, however, to be
captain-general of Manchuria, but again fell under censure, and
on his visit to his paternal estate at Mukden the Emperor took
him back to the capital and appointed him to some important
office. He soon got into new trouble with the Emperor, who in
a proclamation remarks that “Sung is inadequate to the duties
of minister of the imperial presence; because, although he formerly
officiated as such, he is now upward of seventy years of
age, and rides badly on horseback;” he is therefore sent to Manchuria
to fill his old office of captain-general. The next year
the ex-minister and his adherents were involved in a long trial
about the loss of a seal, and he was deprived of his command
and directed to retire to his own Banner; the real reasons of this
disgrace were probably connected with the change of parties ensuent
upon the accession of Taukwang.</p>

<p>Soon afterward Sung was restored to favor and made adjutant
at Jeh ho, after having been president of the Censorate for a
month. He was allowed to remain there longer than usual, and
employed his spare time in writing a book upon the newly acquired
territory in Turkestan. In 1824 he was reinstated as president of
the Censorate, with admonitions not to confuse and puzzle himself
with a multiplicity of extraneous matters. In 1826 he was
sent on a special commission to Shansí, and when he returned
was honored with a dinner at court on new year’s day. He then
appears as travelling tutor to the crown-prince, but where his
royal highness went for his education does not appear; from
this post we find him made president of the Board of Rites,
and appointed to inspect the victims for a state sacrifice. He is
then ordered to Jeh ho, from whence, in a fit of penitence, or
perhaps from fear of a dun, he memorialized the Emperor about
a debt of $52,000 he had incurred nearly thirty years before,
which he proposed to liquidate by foregoing his salary of $1,000
until the arrears were paid up; the Emperor was in good humor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
with the old man, and forgave him the whole amount, being assured,
he says, of Sung’s pure official character. In this memorial,
when recounting his services, the aged officer says that
he has been twice commander-in-chief and governor of Ílí, governor-general
at Nanking, Canton, etc., but had never saved
much.</p>

<p>Shortly after this he is recalled from Jeh ho and made <i>tí-tuh</i>
of Peking, then president of the Board of War; and in a few
months he is ordered to proceed across the desert to Cobdo to
investigate some affair of importance&mdash;a long and toilsome journey
of fifteen hundred miles for a man over seventy-five years
old. He returned the next year and resumed his post as president
of the Board of War, in which capacity he acted as examiner
of the students in the Russian College. In 1831 he was
made president of the Colonial Office, and later received an appointment
as superintendent of the Three Treasuries, but was
obliged to resign from ill health. A month’s relaxation seems
to have wonderfully restored him, for the Emperor, in reply to
his petition for employment, expresses surprise that he should so
soon be fit for official duties, and plainly intimates his opinion
that the disease was all sham, though he accedes to his request
so far as to nominate him commander of one of the eight
Banners. In 1832 Sung again became involved in intrigues,
and was reduced to the third degree of rank; the resignation
of Tohtsin and the struggle for the vacant premiership was
probably the real reason of this new reverse, though a frivolous
accusation of two years’ standing was trumped up against
him. He was restored again, after a few months’ disgrace,
at the petition of a beg of a city in Turkestan, which illustrates,
by the way, the influence which those princes exert. Old age
now began to come upon the courtier in good earnest, and
in 1833 he was ordered to retire with the rank and pay of
adjutant, which he lived to enjoy only two years. Much of
the success of Sung was said to be owing to his having had a
daughter in the harem, but his personal character and kindness
were evidently the main sources of his enduring influence among
all ranks of people and officers; one account says the Manchus
almost worshipped him, and beggars clung to his chair in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
streets to ask alms. It is worthy of notice that in all his reverses
there is no mention made of any severer punishment than
degradation or banishment, and in this particular the political
life of Sung is probably a fair criterion of the usual fortune of
high Chinese statesmen. The leading events in the life of
Changling, the successor of Tohtsin, together with a few notices
of the governor of Canton in 1833, Lí Hung-pin, are given in
the <cite>Repository</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">NOTICE OF COMMISSIONER LIN.</div>

<p>Commissioners Lin and Kíying became more famous among
foreigners than their compeers in the capital, from the parts
they acted in the war with England in 1840, but only a few
notices of their lives are accessible. Lin Tseh-sü was born in
1785, in Fuhchau, and passed through the literary examinations,
becoming a graduate of the second rank at the age of
nineteen, and of the third when twenty-six. After filling an
office or two in the Imperial Academy, he was sent as assistant
literary examiner to Kiangsí in 1816, and during three subsequent
years acted as examiner and censor in various places. In
1819 he filled the office of intendant of circuit, in Chehkiang;
and after absence on account of health, he was, in 1823, appointed
to the post of treasurer of Kiangsu, in the absence of
the incumbent. In 1826 he was made overseer of the Yellow
River, but hearing of his mother’s death, resigned his office to
mourn for her. After the period of mourning was finished he
went to Peking and received the office of judge in Shensí;
but before he had been in it a month he was made treasurer
of Kiangsu, and before he could enter upon this new office he
heard of his father’s death, and was obliged to resign once
more. In 1832 he was nominated treasurer in Hupeh, and
five months later transferred to the same office in Honan, and
six months after that sent to Kiangsu again. Three months
after this third transfer he was reinstated overseer of the
Yellow River, and within a short time elevated to be governor
of Kiangsí, which he retained three years, and acted as governor-general
of Liang Kiang two years more. In 1838 he
was made governor-general of Hu Kwang; and shortly after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
this ordered to come to Peking to be admitted to an imperial
audience, and by special favor permitted to ride on horseback
within the palace.</p>

<p>He was at this audience appointed imperial commissioner to
put down the opium trade and manage the affairs of the maritime
frontier of Kwantung, receiving at the time such plenipotentiary
powers to act for the Emperor as had only once before
been committed to a subject since 1644, viz., when Changling
was sent to Turkestan to quell the insurrection. Lin’s ill success
in dealing with the opium trade and its upholders in the
British government reflect no discredit on his own ability, for
the task was beyond the powers of the Empire; but his fame
even now stands high among the Cantonese. One incident
showing his kindness to the crew of the Sunda, an English
vessel lost on Hainan Island, on their arrival in Canton in
October, 1839, while he was fighting their consular officers,
gave a good insight into the candor of the man. In December,
1839, he was appointed governor-general of Liang Kiang; but
succeeded to that of Liang Kwang in February, 1840. In
October of the same year the seals of office were taken away,
and he was ordered to return to Peking. He remained, however,
till May of the next year to advise with Kíshen in his
difficult negotiations with the English. Lin left Canton in
May, 1841, leading two thousand troops to defend Ningpo, but
this rôle was not his forte. In July, 1842, he was banished to
Ílí, but the sentence was suspended for a season by giving him
a third time the oversight of the Yellow River. However, in
1844 we find him in Ílí, holding an inferior appointment and
trying to bring waste lands near the Mohammedan cities under
cultivation; his zeal was rewarded the next year by a pardon,
and the year after that by the high post of governor-general of
Shensí and Kansuh, in which region he set himself to work to
reform the civil service and increase the revenue. In 1847 the
cares of office wore upon him, so that he asked for a furlough
and went back to Fuhchau, aged sixty-two. His ambition was
not yet satisfied, for he was made governor-general in Yunnan
in 1848, but his strength was not equal to its duties, and
he again retired in 1849. The young Emperor Hienfung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
startled at the rapid rise of the Tai-ping rebels, applied to the
aged statesman to help him as he had his father. Lin responded
to the call of his sovereign, but death came upon him
before he reached Kwangsí, on the 22d of November, 1850, at
the age of sixty-seven. More enduring than some of his official
acts was the preparation and publication of the <cite>History of
Maritime Nations</cite>, with maps, in fifty books, in which he gave
his countrymen all the details he could gather of other nations.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CAREER OF COMMISSIONER KÍYING.</div>

<p>Much less is known of the official life of Kíying than of Lin,
but the Manchu proved himself superior to the Chinese in
trimming his course to meet the inevitable and avoid the rocks
his predecessor struck. In 1835 his name is mentioned as
president of the Board of Revenue and controller of the
Tsung-jin fu. He was detained at the capital as commander-in-chief
of the forces there until 1842, when his Majesty sent him
to Canton to take the place of Yihshan. He was ordered to
stop at Hangchau, however, on his way, and make a report of the
condition of affairs; his memorials seem to have had great influence,
for he was appointed joint commissioner with Ílípu in
April of that year. At the negotiations of Nanking Kíying
acted as chief commissioner, and was mainly instrumental in
bringing the war to a conclusion. He proceeded to Canton in
May, 1843, to succeed Ílípu, and there acted as sole commissioner
in negotiating the supplementary treaty and the commercial
regulations with the British, returning to the capital in
December, 1843. His prudence and vigor had great effect in
calming the irritation of the people of Canton. On the arrival
of the American plenipotentiary he was vested with full
powers to treat with Mr. Cushing, and soon after with the
French and Swedish envoys, with all of whom he signed
treaties. During the progress of these negotiations Kí Kung
died and Kíying succeeded him.</p>

<p>His administration as governor-general continued till January,
1848, when he returned to Peking to receive higher honors
from the Emperor. In 1849 he went to Kiangsu to inquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
into the salt department, and then to Northern Shansí to settle
differences with the Mongols. From this period he held
various posts in the cabinet and capital, busy in all court intrigues,
and rather losing his good name, till he fell into disgrace.
In 1856, when the envoys of the four western Powers
were at Tientsin, he entered into some underhand dealings
against the policy of Kweiliang and Hwashana, and was sent
there as joint commissioner. He had hardly entered upon his
functions by the presentation of his commission, when he suddenly
returned to Peking against the Emperor’s will, and was
ordered to take poison in the presence of the head of the Clan
to avoid the ignominy of a public execution.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Few Chinese
statesmen in modern times have borne a higher character for
prudence, dignity, and intelligence than Kíying, and the confidence
reposed in him is creditable to his imperial master. In
his demeanor, says Sir Thomas Wade, “there was a combination
of dignity and courtesy which more than balanced the
deficiencies of a by no means attractive exterior.” The portrait
of him has been engraved from a native painting made at
Canton, and is a good one. It was kindly furnished for this
work by J. R. Peters, Jr.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AGED STATESMEN RETAINED IN OFFICE.</div>

<p>The facts of this man’s career are not all known, but his connection
by birth with the Clan brought him into an entirely
different set of influences from Lin, while his training removed
him from the contact with the people which made the other so
popular and influential. Both of them were good instances of
Chinese statesmen, and their checkered lives as here briefly
noticed resemble that of their compeers in the highest grades
of official dignity. The sifting which the personnel of the
Emperor’s employees in all their various grades receive generally
brings the cleverest and most trustworthy to the top; no
one can come in contact with them in state affairs without an
increase of respect for their shrewdness, loyalty, and skill. One
observable feature of the Chinese political world is the great
age of the high officers, and it is not easy to account for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
being kept in their posts, when almost worn out, by a monarch
who wished to have efficient men around him, until we learn
how little real power he can arbitrarily exert over the details of
the branches of his government. It is somewhat explainable
on the ground that, as long as the old incumbents are alive, the
Emperor, being more habituated to their company and advice,
prefers to retain those whose competency has been proven by
their service. The patriarch, kept near the Emperor, is moreover
a kind of hostage for the loyalty of his following; and the
latter, scattered throughout the provinces, can be managed and
moved about through him with less opposition: he is, still
further, a convenient medium through which to receive the
exactions of the younger members of the service, and convey
such intimations as are thought necessary. The system of
clientelage which existed among the Gauls and Franks is also
found in China with some modifications, and has a tendency to
link officers to one another in parties of different degrees of
power. The Emperor published an order in 1833 against this
system of patronage, and it is evident that he would find it
seriously interfering with his power were it not constantly
broken up by changing the relations of the parties and sending
them away in different directions. Peking is almost the
only place where the “teacher and pupils,” as the patron and
client call each other, could combine to much purpose; and the
principal safeguard the throne seems to have against intrigues
and parties around it lies in the conflicting interests arising
among themselves, though a long-established or unscrupulous
favorite, as in the cases of Duke Ho and Suhshun in 1855-61,
can sometimes manage to engross the whole power of the
crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VALEDICTORY VERSES OF GOVERNOR CHU.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the heavy charges of oppression, cruelty,
bribery, and mendacity which are often brought against officers
with more or less justice, it must not be inferred that no good
qualities exist among them. Thousands of them desire to rule
equitably, to clear the innocent and punish the guilty, and
exert all the knowledge and power they possess to discharge
their functions to the acceptance of their master and their own
good name among the inhabitants. Such officers, too, generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
rise, while the cruelties of others are visited with degradation.
The pasquinades which the people stick up in the streets indicate
their sentiments, and receive much more attention than
would such vulgar expressions in other countries, because it is
almost the only way in which their opinions can be safely
uttered. The popularity which upright officers receive acts as
an incentive to others to follow in the same steps, as well as a
reward to the person himself. The governor of Kwangtung in
1833, Chu, was a very popular officer, and when he obtained
leave to resign his station on account of age, the people vied
with each other in showing their hearty regret at losing him.
The old custom was observed of retaining his boots and presenting
him with a new pair at every city he passed through,
and many other testimonials of their regard were adopted.
On leaving the city of Canton he circulated a few verses, “to
console the people and excite them to virtue,” for he heard that
some of them wept on learning of his departure.</p>

<p>Ílípu, Kí Kung, the late governor-general of Kwangtung, and
Shu, the prefect of Ningpo in 1842, are other officers who have
been popular in late years. When Lin passed through Macao
in 1839, the Chinese had in several places erected honorary portals
adorned with festoons of silk and laudatory scrolls; and
when he passed the doors of their houses and shops they set out
tables decorated with vases of flowers, “in order to manifest
their profound gratitude for his coming to save them from a
deadly vice, and for removing from them a dire calamity by the
destruction and severe interdiction of opium.” Alas, that his
efforts and intentions should have been so fruitless!</p>

<div class="sidenote">OFFICIAL PETITIONS AND CONFESSIONS.</div>

<p>The <cite>Peking Gazette</cite> frequently contains petitions from old
officers describing their ailments, their fear lest they shall not
be able to perform their duties, the length of their official service,
and requesting leave of absence or permission to retire.
It is impossible to regard all the expressions of loyalty in these
papers, coming as they do from every class of officers, as heartless
and made out according to a prescribed form; but we are
too ready to measure them by our own standard and fashion,
forgetting that it is not the defects of a system which give
the best standard of its value and efficiency. Let us rather,
as an honest expression of feeling, quote a few lines from a
memorial of Shí, a censor in 1824: “Reflecting within myself
that, notwithstanding the decay of my strength, it has still
pleased the imperial goodness to employ me in a high office instead
of rejecting and discarding me at once, I have been most
anxious to effect a cure, in order that, a weak old horse as I am,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
it might be still in my power, by the exertion of my whole
strength, to recompense a ten-thousandth part of the benevolence
which restored me to life.”<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Connected with the triennial schedule of official merits and
demerits is the necessity the high officers of state are under of
confessing their faults of government; and the two form a
peculiar and somewhat stringent check upon their intrigues and
malversation, making them, as Le Comte observes, “exceeding
circumspect and careful, and sometimes even virtuous against
their own inclinations.” The confessions reported in the <cite>Peking
Gazette</cite> are, however, by no means satisfactory as to the real extent
or nature of these acts; most of the confessors are censors,
and perhaps it is in virtue of their office that they thus sit in
judgment upon themselves. Examples of the crimes mentioned
are not wanting. The governor-general of Chihlí requested severe
punishment in 1832 for not having discovered a plotting
demagogue who had collected several thousand adherents in his
and the next provinces; his request was granted. An admiral
in the same province demands punishment for not having properly
educated his son, as thereby he went mad and wounded
several people. Another calls for judgment upon himself because
the Empress-dowager had been kept waiting at the palace
gate by the porters when she paid her Majesty a visit. One
officer accused himself for not being able to control the Yellow
River; and his Majesty’s cook in 1830 requested punishment for
being too late in presenting his bill of fare, but was graciously
forgiven. The rarity of these confessions, compared with
the actual sins, shows either that they are, like a partridge’s
doublings, made to draw off attention from the real nest of
malversation, or that few officers are willing to undergo the
mortification.</p>

<p>The Emperor, in his character of vicegerent of heaven, occasionally
imposes the duty of self-confession upon himself.
Kiaking issued several public confessions during his reign, but
the <cite>Gazette</cite> has not contained many such papers within the last
thirty years. These confessions are drawn from him more by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
natural calamities, such as drought, freshets, epidemics, etc.,
than by political causes, though insurrections, fires, ominous
portents, etc., sometimes induce them. The personal character
of the monarch has much to do with their frequency and
phraseology. On occasion of a drought in 1817 the Emperor
Kiaking said: “The remissness and sloth of the officers of government
constitute an evil which has long been accumulating.
It is not the evil of a day; for several years I have given the
most pressing admonitions on the subject, and have punished
many cases which have been discovered, so that recently there
appears a little improvement, and for several seasons the
weather has been favorable. The drought this season is not
perhaps entirely on their (the officers’) account. I have meditated
upon it, and am persuaded that the reason why the azure
Heavens above manifest disapprobation by withholding rain for
a few hundred miles only around the capital, is that the fifty and
more rebels who escaped are secreted somewhere near Peking.
Hence it is that fertile vapors are fast bound, and the felicitous
harmony of the seasons interrupted.” On the 14th of May,
1818, between five and six o’clock in the evening, a sudden
darkness enveloped the capital, attended by a violent wind from
the southeast and much rain. During its action two intervals
occurred when the sky became a lurid red and the air offensive,
terrible claps of thunder startling the people and frightening the
monarch. His astrologers could not relieve his forebodings of
evil, and he issued a manifesto to explain the matter to his
subjects and discharge his own conscience. One sentence is
worth quoting: “Calumnious accusations cause the ruin and
death of a multitude of innocent people; they alone are capable
of provoking a sign as terrible as this one just seen. The wind
coming from the southeast is proof enough that some great
crime has been committed in that region, which the officials, by
neglecting their duties, have ignored, and thereby excited the
ire of Heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PRAYER FOR RAIN OF TAUKWANG.</div>

<p>One of the most remarkable specimens of these papers is a
prayer for rain issued by Taukwang, July 24, 1832, on occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
of a severe drought at the capital. Before publishing this
paper he had endeavored to mollify the anger and heat of
heaven by ordering all suspected and accused persons in the
prisons of the metropolis to be tried, and their guilt or innocence
established, in order that the course of justice might not
be delayed, and witnesses be released from confinement. But
these vicarious corrections did not avail, and the drought continuing,
he was obliged, as high-priest of the Empire, to show
the people that he was mindful of their sufferings, and would
relieve them, if possible, by presenting the following memorial:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Kneeling, a memorial is hereby presented, to cause affairs to be heard.</p>

<p>“Oh, alas! imperial Heaven, were not the world afflicted by extraordinary
changes, I would not dare to present extraordinary services. But this year
the drought is most unusual. Summer is past, and no rain has fallen. Not
only do agriculture and human beings feel the dire calamity, but also beasts
and insects, herbs and trees, almost cease to live. I, the minister of Heaven,
am placed over mankind, and am responsible for keeping the world in order
and tranquillizing the people. Although it is now impossible for me to sleep
or eat with composure, although I am scorched with grief and tremble with
anxiety, still, after all, no genial and copious showers have been obtained.</p>

<p>“Some days ago I fasted, and offered rich sacrifices on the altars of the gods
of the land and the grain, and had to be thankful for gathering clouds and
slight showers; but not enough to cause gladness. Looking up, I consider
that Heaven’s heart is benevolence and love. The sole cause is the daily
deeper atrocity of my sins; but little sincerity and little devotion. Hence
I have been unable to move Heaven’s heart, and bring down abundant
blessings.</p>

<p>“Having searched the records, I find that in the twenty-fourth year of Kienlung
my exalted Ancestor, the Emperor Pure, reverently performed a ‘great
snow service.’ I feel impelled, by ten thousand considerations, to look up and
imitate the usage, and with trembling anxiety rashly assail Heaven, examine
myself, and consider my errors; looking up and hoping that I may obtain
pardon. I ask myself whether in sacrificial services I have been disrespectful?
Whether or not pride and prodigality have had a place in my heart,
springing forth there unobserved? Whether, from length of time, I have
become remiss in attending to the affairs of government, and have been
unable to attend to them with that serious diligence and strenuous effort which
I ought? Whether I have uttered irreverent words, and have deserved reprehension?
Whether perfect equity has been attained in conferring rewards or
inflicting punishments? Whether in raising mausolea and laying out gardens
I have distressed the people and wasted property? Whether in the appointment
of officers I have failed to obtain fit persons, and thereby the acts of government
have been petty and vexatious to the people? Whether punishments
have been unjustly inflicted or not? Whether the oppressed have found no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
means of appeal? Whether in persecuting heterodox sects the innocent have
not been involved? Whether or not the magistrates have insulted the people
and refused to listen to their affairs? Whether, in the successive military
operations on the western frontiers, there may not have been the horrors of
human slaughter for the sake of imperial rewards? Whether the largesses
bestowed on the afflicted southern provinces were properly applied, or the
people were left to die in the ditches? Whether the efforts to exterminate or
pacify the rebellious mountaineers of Hunan and Kwangtung were properly
conducted; or whether they led to the inhabitants being trampled on as mire
and ashes? To all these topics to which my anxieties have been directed I
ought to lay the plumb-line, and strenuously endeavor to correct what is
wrong; still recollecting that there may be faults which have not occurred to
me in my meditations.</p>

<p>“Prostrate I beg imperial Heaven (<i>Hwang Tien</i>) to pardon my ignorance and
stupidity, and to grant me self-renovation; for myriads of innocent people are
involved by me, the One man. My sins are so numerous it is difficult to escape
from them. Summer is past and autumn arrived; to wait longer will really be
impossible. Knocking head, I pray imperial Heaven to hasten and confer
gracious deliverance&mdash;a speedy and divinely beneficial rain, to save the people’s
lives and in some degree redeem my iniquities. Oh, alas! imperial
Heaven, observe these things. Oh, alas! imperial Heaven, be gracious to
them. I am inexpressibly grieved, alarmed, and frightened. Reverently
this memorial is presented.”<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p></div>

<p>This paper apparently intimates some acknowledgment of a
ruling power above, and before a despot like the Emperor of
China would place himself in such an equivocal posture before
his people, he would assure himself very thoroughly of their
sentiments; for its effects as a state paper would be worse than
null if the least ridicule was likely to be thrown upon it. In this
case heavy showers followed the same evening, and appropriate
thanksgivings were ordered and oblations presented before the
six altars of heaven, earth, land, and grain, and the gods of
heaven, earth, and the revolving year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">METHODS OF PUBLISHING EDICTS.</div>

<p>The orders of the court are usually transmitted in manuscript,
except when some grand event or state ceremony requires
a general proclamation, in which cases the document is printed
on yellow paper and published in both the Chinese and Manchu
languages, encircled with a border of dragons. The governors
and their subordinates, imperial commissioners, and collectors
of customs are the principal officers in the provinces who pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>lish
their orders to the people, consisting of admonitions, exhortations,
regulations, laws, special ordinances, threatenings, and
municipal requirements. Standing laws and local regulations
are often superbly carved on tablets of black marble, and placed
in the streets to be “held in everlasting remembrance,” so that
no one can plead ignorance; a custom which recalls the mode
of publishing the Twelve Tables at Rome. Several of these
monuments, beautifully ornamented, are to be seen at Canton
and Macao. The usual mode of publishing the commands of
government is to print the document in large characters, and
post copies at the door of the offices and in the streets in public
places, with the seal of the officer attached to authenticate them.
The sheets on which they are printed being common bamboo
paper, and having no protection from the weather, are, however,
soon destroyed; the people read them as they are thus
exposed, and copy them if they wish, but it is not uncommon,
too, for the magistrates to print important edicts in pamphlet
form for circulation. These placards are written in an official
style, differing from common writing as much as that does
in English, but not involved or obscure. A single specimen of
an edict issued at Canton will suffice to illustrate the form of
such papers, and moreover show upon what subjects a Chinese
ruler sometimes legislates, and the care he is expected to take
of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a id="EDICT_FOR_THE_DESTRUCTION_OF_GRASSHOPPERS"></a>EDICT FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF GRASSHOPPERS.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sü and Hwang, by special appointment magistrates of the districts of Nanhai
and Pwanyu, raised ten steps and recorded ten times, hereby distinctly
publish important rules for the capture of grasshoppers, that it may be known
how to guard against them in order to ward off injury and calamity. On the
7th day of the 8th month in the 13th year of Taukwang [September 20, 1833],
we received a communication from the prefect of the [department of Kwangchau],
transmitting a despatch from their excellencies the governor-general and
governor, as follows:</p>

<p>“‘During the fifth month of the present year flights of grasshoppers appeared
in the limits of Kwangsí, in [the departments of] Liu, Tsin, Kwei, and Wu,
and their vicinage, which have already, according to report, been clean destroyed
and driven off. We have heard that in the department of Kauchau
and its neighborhood, conterminous to Kwangsí, grasshoppers have appeared
which multiply with extreme rapidity. At this time the second crop is in the
blade (which if destroyed will endamage the people), and it is proper, therefore,
immediately, wherever they are found, to capture and drive them off,
marshalling the troops to advance and wholly exterminate them. But Kwang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>tung
heretofore has never experienced this calamity, and we apprehend the
officers and people do not understand the mode of capture; wherefore we now
exhibit in order the most important rules for catching grasshoppers. Let the
governor’s combined forces be immediately instructed to capture them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum
artem</i>; at the same time let orders be issued for the villagers and farmers at
once to assemble and take them, and for the magistrate to establish storehouses
for their reception and purchase, thus without fail sweeping them clean away.
If you do not exert yourselves to catch the grasshoppers, your guilt will be
very great; let it be done carefully, not clandestinely delaying, thus causing
this misfortune to come upon yourselves, transgressing the laws, and causing
us again, according to the exigencies of the case, to promulgate general orders
and make thorough examination, etc., etc. Appended hereto are copies of the
rules for catching grasshoppers, which from the lieutenant-governor must be
sent to the treasurer, who will enjoin it upon the magistrates of the departments,
and he again upon the district magistrates.’</p>

<p>“Having received the preceding, besides respectfully transmitting it to the
colonel of the department to be straightway forwarded to all the troops under
his authority, and also to all the district justices, that they all with united
purpose bend their energies to observe, at the proper time, that whenever the
grasshoppers become numerous they join their forces and extirpate them, thus
removing calamity from the people; we also enjoin upon whomsoever receives
this that the grasshoppers be caught according to these several directions,
which are therefore here arranged in order as follows:</p>

<p>“‘1. When the grasshoppers first issue forth they are to be seen on the
borders of large morasses, from whence they quickly multiply and fill large
tracts of land; they produce their young in little hillocks of black earth, using
the tail to bore into the ground, not quite an inch in depth, which still remain
as open holes, the whole somewhat resembling a bee’s nest. One grasshopper
drops ten or more pellets, in form like a pea, each one containing a hundred
or more young. For the young grasshoppers fly and eat in swarms, and this
laying of their young is done all at once and in the same spot; the place resembles
a hive of bees, and therefore it is very easily sought and found.</p>

<p>“‘2. When the grasshoppers are in the fields of wheat and tender rice and
the thick grass, every day at early dawn they all alight on the leaves of the
grass, and their bodies being covered with dew are heavy and they cannot fly
or hop; at noon they begin to assemble for flight, and at evening they collect
in one spot. Thus each day there are three periods when they can be caught,
and the people and gentry will also have a short respite. The mode of catching
them is to dig a trench before them, the broader and longer the better, on
each side placing boards, doors, screens, and such like things, one stretched
on after another, and spreading open each side. The whole multitude must
then cry aloud, and, holding boards in their hands, drive them all into the
trench; meanwhile those on the opposite side, provided with brooms and
rakes, on seeing any leaping or crawling out, must sweep them back; then
covering them with dry grass, burn them all up. Let the fire be first kindled
in the trench, and then drive them into it; for if they are only buried up,
then many of them will crawl out of the openings and so escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘3. When the swarms of grasshoppers see a row of trees, or a close line of
flags and streamers, they usually hover over and settle; and the farmers frequently
suspend red and white clothes and petticoats on long poles, or make
red and green paper flags, but they do not always settle with great rapidity.
Moreover, they dread the noise of gongs, matchlocks, and guns, hearing which
they fly away. If they come so as to obscure the heavens, you must let off
the guns and clang the gongs, or fire the crackers; it will strike the front
ranks with dread, and flying away, the rest will follow them and depart.</p>

<p>“‘4. When the wings and legs of the grasshoppers are taken off, and [their
bodies] dried in the sun, the taste is like dried prawns, and moreover, they
can be kept a long time without spoiling. Ducks can also be reared upon the
dried grasshoppers, and soon become large and fat. Moreover, the hill people
catch them to feed pigs; these pigs, weighing at first only twenty catties
or so, in ten days’ time grow to weigh more than fifty catties; and in rearing
all domestic animals they are of use. Let all farmers exert themselves and
catch them alive, giving rice or money according to the number taken. In
order to remove this calamity from your grain, what fear is there that you will
not perform this? Let all these rules for catching the grasshoppers be diligently
carried into full effect.’</p>

<p>“Wherefore these commands are transcribed that all you soldiers and people
may be fully acquainted with them. Do you all then immediately in
obedience to them, when you see the proper time has come, sound the gong;
and when you see the grasshoppers and their young increasing, straightway
get ready, on the one hand seizing them, and on the other announcing to the
officers that they collect the troops, that with united strength you may at once
catch them, without fail making an utter extermination of them; thus calamity
will be removed from the people. We will also then confer rewards upon
those of the farmers and people who first announce to the magistrates their
approach. Let every one implicitly obey. A special command.</p>

<p>“Promulgated Taukwang, 13th year, 8th month, and 15th day.”<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER AND PHRASEOLOGY OF THE EDICTS.</div>

<p>The concluding part of an edict affords some room for displaying
the character of the promulgator. Among other endings
are such as these: “Hasten! hasten! a special edict.”
“Tremble hereat intensely.” “Lay not up for yourselves future
repentance by disobedience.” “I will by no means eat my
words.” “Earnestly observe these things.” In their state
papers Chinese officers are constantly referring to ultimate
truths and axioms, and deducing arguments therefrom in a
peculiarly national grandiloquent manner, though some of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
conclusions are preposterous non-sequiturs. Commissioner Lin
addressed a letter to the Queen of England regarding the interdiction
of opium, which began with the following preamble:</p>

<p>“Whereas, the ways of Heaven are without partiality, and no
sanction is allowed to injure others in order to benefit one’s
self, and that men’s natural feelings are not very diverse (for
where is he who does not abhor death and love life?)&mdash;therefore
your honorable nation, though beyond the wide ocean at
a distance of twenty thousand <i>lí</i>, also acknowledges the same
ways of Heaven, the same human nature, and has the like perceptions
of the distinctions between life and death, benefit and
injury. Our heavenly court has for its family all that is within
the four seas; and as to the great Emperor’s heaven-like benevolence&mdash;there
is none whom it does not overshadow; even
regions remote, desert, and disconnected have a part in his
general care of life and well-being.”</p>

<p>The edicts furnish almost the only exponents of the intentions
of government. They present several characteristic features
of the ignorant conceit and ridiculous assumptions of the
Chinese, while they betray the real weakness of the authorities
in the mixture of argument and command, coaxing and threatening,
pervading every paragraph. According to their phraseology,
there can possibly be no failure in the execution of every
order; if they are once made known, the obedience of the people
follows almost as a matter of course; while at the same
time both the writer and the people know that most of them are
not only perfunctory but nearly useless. The responsibility of
the writer in a measure ceases with the promulgation of his
orders, and when they reach the last in the series their efficiency
has well nigh departed. Expediency is the usual guide
for obedience; deceiving superiors and oppressing the people
the rule of action on the part of many officials; and their orders
do not more strikingly exhibit their weakness and ignorance
than their mendacity and conceit. A large proportion of
well-meaning officers are sensible too that all their efforts will
be neutralized by the half-paid, unscrupulous retainers and
clerks in the <i>yamuns</i>; and this checks their energy.</p>

<p>It is not easy, without citing many examples accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
with particular explanations, to give a just idea of the actual
execution of the laws, and show how far the people are secured
in life and property by their rulers; and perhaps nothing has
been the source of such differing views regarding the Chinese
as the predominance writers give either to the theory or the
practice of legislation. Old Magaillans has hit this point pretty
well when he says: “It seems as if the legislators had omitted
nothing, and that they had foreseen all inconveniences that were
to be feared; so that I am persuaded no kingdom in the world
could be better governed or more happy, if the conduct and
probity of the officers were but answerable to the institution of
the government. But in regard they have no knowledge of the
true God, nor of the eternal rewards and punishments of the
other world, they are subject to no remorses of conscience, they
place all their happiness in pleasure, in dignity and riches; and
therefore, to obtain these fading advantages, they violate all
the laws of God and man, trampling under foot religion, reason,
justice, honesty, and all the rights of consanguinity and
friendship. The inferior officers mind nothing but how to defraud
their superiors, they the supreme tribunals, and all together
how to cheat the king; which they know how to do
with so much cunning and address, making use in their memorials
of words and expressions so soft, so honest, so respectful,
so humble and full of adulation, and of reasons so plausible,
that the deluded prince frequently takes the greatest falsehoods
for solemn truths. So that the people, finding themselves continually
oppressed and overwhelmed without any reason, murmur
and raise seditions and revolts, which have caused so much
ruin and so many changes in the Empire. Nevertheless, there
is no reason that the excellency and perfection of the laws of
China should suffer for the depravity and wickedness of the
magistrates.”<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EXTORTIONS PRACTISED BY MAGISTRATES.</div>

<p>Magaillans resided in China nearly forty years, and his opinion
may be considered on the whole as a fair judgment of the
real condition of the people and the policy of their rulers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
When one is living in the country itself, to hear the complaints
of individuals against the extortion and cruelty of their rulers,
and to read the reports of judicial murder, torture, and crime
in the <cite>Peking Gazette</cite>, are enough to cause one to wonder how
such atrocities and oppressions are endured from year to year,
and why the sufferers do not rise and throw aside the tyrannous
power which thus abuses them. But the people are generally
conscious that their rulers are no better than themselves,
and that they would really gain nothing by such a procedure,
and their desire to maintain as great a degree of peace as possible
leads them to submit to many evils, which in western
countries would soon be remedied or cause a revolution. In
order to restrain the officers in their misrule, Section CCX. of the
code ordains that “If any officer of government, whose situation
gives him power and control over the people, not only does
not conciliate them by proper indulgence, but exercises his
authority in a manner so inconsistent with the established laws
and approved usages of the Empire, that the sentiments of the
once loyal subjects being changed by his oppressive conduct,
they assemble tumultuously and openly rebel, and drive him at
length from the capital city and seat of his government; such
officer shall suffer death.”</p>

<p>By the laws of China, every officer of the nine ranks must
be previously qualified for duty by a degree; in the ninth are
included village magistrates, deputy treasurers, jailers, etc., but
the police, local interpreters, clerks, and other attendants on the
courts are not considered as having any rank, and most of them
are natives of the place where they are employed. The only
degradation they can feel is to turn them out of their stations,
but this is hardly a palliative of the evils the people suffer from
them; the new leech is more thirsty than the old. The cause
of many of the extortions the people suffer from their rulers is
found in the system of purchasing office, at all times practised
in one shape or other, but occasionally resorted to by the government.
As the counterpart of this system, that of receiving
bribes must be expected therefore to prevail, and being in fact
practised by all grades of dignitaries, and sometimes even upheld
by them as a “necessary evil,” it adds still more to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
bad consequences resulting from this mode of obtaining office.
Indeed, so far is the practice of “covering the eyes” carried in
China, that the people seldom approach their rulers without a
gift to make way for them.</p>

<p>One mode taken by the highest ranks to obtain money is to
notify inferiors that there are certain days on which presents
are expected, and custom soon increases these as much as the
case will admit. Subscriptions for objects of public charity or
disbursements, such as an inundation, a bad harvest, bursting
of dikes, and other similar things which the government must
look after, are not unfrequently made a source of revenue to
the incumbents by requiring much more than is needed; those
who subscribe are rewarded by an empty title, a peacock’s
feather, or employment in some insignificant formality. The
sale of titular rank is a source of revenue, but the government
never attempts to subvert or interfere with the well-known
channel of attaining office by literary merit, and it seldom confers
much real power for money when unconnected with some
degree of fitness. The security of its own position is not to be
risked for the sake of an easy means of filling its exchequer,
yet it is impossible to say how far the sale of office and title is
carried. The censors inveigh against it, and the Emperor
almost apologizes for resorting to it, but it is nevertheless constantly
practised. The government stocks of this description
were opened during the late rebellions and foreign wars, as the
necessities of the case were a sufficient excuse for the disreputable
practice. In 1835 the sons of two of the leading hong-merchants
were promoted, in consequence of their donations of
$25,000 each to repair the ravages of an inundation; subscribers
to the amount of $10,000 and upward were rewarded by an
honorary title, whose only privilege is that it saves its possessor
from a bambooing, it being the law that no one holding any
office can be personally chastised.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">AGENTS AND MODES OF OFFICIAL EXACTION.</div>

<p>Besides the lower officers, the clerks in their employ and the
police, who are often taken from the garrison soldiery, are the
agents in the hands of the upper ranks to squeeze the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
There are many clerks of various duties and grades about all
the offices who receive small salaries, and every application and
petition to their superiors, going through their hands, is attended
by a bribe to pass them up. The military police and
servants connected with the offices are not paid any regular
salary, and their number is great. In the large districts, like
those of Nanhai and Pwanyu, which compose the city of Canton
and suburbs, it is said there are about a thousand unpaid
police; in the middle-sized ones between three and four hundred,
and in the smallest from one to two hundred. This
number is increased by the domestics attending high officers as
part of their suite, and by their old acquaintances, who make
themselves known when there is any likelihood of being employed.
Among other abuses mentioned by the censors is that
of magistrates appointing their own creatures to fill vacancies
until those nominated by his Majesty arrive; like a poor man
oppressing the poor, such officers are a sweeping rain. A
similar abuse arises when country magistrates leave their posts
to go to the provincial capital to dance attendance upon their
superiors, and get nominated to a higher place or taken into
their service as secretaries, because they will work for nothing;
the duties of their vacated offices are meantime usually left undone,
and underlings take advantage of their absence to make
new exactions. The governor fills vacant offices with his own
friends, and recommends them to his Majesty to be confirmed;
but this has little effect in consolidating a system of oppression
from the constant changes going on. In fact, it is hard to say
which feature of the Chinese polity is the least disastrous to
good government, these constant changes which neutralize all
sympathy with the people on the part of rulers, or on the
other hand make it useless for seditious men to try to foment
rebellion.</p>

<p>The retinues of high provincial officers contain many dependents
and expectant supernumeraries, all subservient to
them; among them are the descendants of poor officers; the
sons of bankrupt merchants who once possessed influence;
dissipated, well bred, unscrupulous men, who lend themselves
to everything flagitious; and lastly, fortune-seekers without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
money, but possessing talents of good order to be used by any
one who will hire them. Such persons are not peculiar to
China, and their employment is guarded against in the code,
but no law is more of a dead letter. Officers of government,
too, conscious of their delinquencies, and afraid their posts will
soon be taken from them, of course endeavor to make the most
of their opportunities, and by means of such persons, who are
usually well acquainted with the leading inhabitants of the
district, harass and threaten such as are likely to pay well for
being left in quiet. It does them little or no good, however,
for if they are not removed they must fee their superiors, and
if they are punished for their misdeeds they are still more certain
of losing their wicked exactions.</p>

<p>In the misappropriation of public funds, and peculation of all
kinds in materials, government stores, rations, wages, and salaries,
the Chinese officials are skilled experts, and are never surprised
at any disclosures.</p>

<p>Another common mode of plundering the people is for officers
to collude with bands of thieves, and allow them to escape for a
composition when arrested, or substitute other persons for the
guilty party in case the real offenders are likely to be condemned.
Sometimes these banditti are too strong even for an
upright magistrate, and he is obliged to overlook what he cannot
remedy; for, however much he may wish to arrest and
bring them to justice, his policemen are too much afraid of
their vengeance to venture upon attacking them. An instance
of this occurred near Canton in 1839, when a boat, containing a
clerk of the court and three or four police, came into the fleet
of European opium-ships to hunt for some desperate opium
smugglers who had taken refuge there. The fellows, hearing
of the arrival of the boat, came in the night, and surrounding
it took out the crew, bound their pursuers, and burned them
alive with the boat in sight of the whole fleet, to whom the
desperadoes looked for protection against their justly incensed
countrymen.</p>

<p>A censor in 1819, complaining of flagrant neglect in the administration
of justice in Chihlí, says: “Among the magistrates
are many who, without fear or shame, connive at robbery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
and deceit. Formerly, horse-stealers were wont to conceal
themselves in some secret place, but now they openly bring
their plunder to market for sale. When they perceive a person
to be weak, they are in the habit of stealing his property
and returning it to him for money, while the officers, on hearing
it, treat it as a trivial matter, and blame the sufferer for
not being more cautious. Thieves are apprehended with warrants
on them, showing that when they were sent out to arrest
thieves they availed of the opportunity to steal for themselves.
And at a village near the imperial residence are very many
plunderers concealed, who go out by night in companies of
twenty or thirty persons, carrying weapons with them; they
frequently call up the inhabitants, break open the doors, and
having satisfied themselves with what food and wine they can
obtain, they threaten and extort money, which if they cannot
procure they seize their clothes, ornaments, or cattle, and depart.
They also frequently go to shops, and having broken
open the shutters impudently demand money, which if they do
not get they set fire to the shop with the torches in their
hands. If the master of the house lay hold on a few of them
and sends them to the magistrate, he merely imprisons and
beats them, and before half a month allows them to run
away.”<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">VENALITY OF THE POLICE AND CLERKS.</div>

<p>The unpaid retainers about the <i>yamuns</i> are very numerous,
and are more dreaded than the police; one censor says they are
looked upon by the people as tigers and wolves; he effected
the discharge of nearly twenty-four thousand of them in the
province of Chihlí alone. They are usually continued in their
places by the head magistrate, who, when he arrives, being
ignorant of the characters of those he must employ, re-engages
such as are likely to serve. In cases of serious accusation the
clerks frequently subpœna all who are likely to be implicated,
and demand a fee for liberating them when their innocence is
shown. These myrmidons still fear the anger of their superiors
and a recoil of the people so far as to endeavor to save
appearances by hushing up the matter, and liberating those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
unjustly apprehended, with great protestations of compassion.
It may be added that, as life is not lightly taken, thieves are
careful not to murder or maltreat their victims dangerously,
nor do the magistrates venture to take life outright by torture,
though their cruelties frequently result in death by neglect or
starvation. Money and goods are what both policemen and
officials want, not blood and revenge. Parties at strife with
each other frequently resort to legal implication to gratify their
ill-will, and take a pitiful revenge by egging on the police to
pillage and vex their enemy, though they themselves profit nowise
thereby.</p>

<p>The evils resulting from a half-paid and venal magistracy are
dreadful, and the prospects of their removal very slight. The
governor of Chihlí, in 1829, memorialized the Emperor upon
the state of the police, and pointed out a remedy for many
abuses, one of which was to pay them fair salaries out of the
public treasury; but it is plain that this remedy must begin
with the monarch, for until an officer is released from sopping
his superior he will not cease exacting from his inferiors. Experience
has shown the authorities how far it can safely be carried;
while many officers, seeing how useless it is to irritate the
people, so far as ultimately enriching themselves is concerned,
endeavor to restrain their policemen. One governor issued an
edict, stating that none of his domestics were allowed to browbeat
shopmen, and thus get goods or eatables below the market
price, and permitted the seller to collar and bring them to him
for punishment when they did so. When an officer of high
rank, as a governor, treasurer, etc., takes the seals of his post, he
ofttimes issues a proclamation, exhorting the subordinate ranks
to do as he means to do&mdash;“to look up and embody the kindness
of the high Emperor,” and attend to the faithful discharge of
their duties. The lower officers, in their turn, join in the cry,
and a series of proclamations, by turns hortative and mandatory,
are echoed from mastiff, spaniel, and poodle, until the cry ends
upon the police. Thus the prefect of Canton says: “There are
hard-hearted soldiers and gnawing lictors who post themselves
at ferries or markets, or rove about the streets, to extort money
under various pretexts; or, being intoxicated, they disturb and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
annoy the people in a hundred ways. Since I came into office
here I have repeatedly commanded the inferior magistrates to
act faithfully and seize such persons, but the depraved spirit
still continues.”</p>

<p>A censor, speaking of the police, says: “They no sooner get
a warrant to bring up witnesses than they assail both plaintiff
and defendant for money to pay their expenses, from the amount
of ten taels to several scores. Then the clerks must have double
what the runners get; if their demands be not satisfied they contrive
every species of annoyance. Then, again, if there are people
of property in the neighborhood, they will implicate them.
They plot also with pettifogging lawyers to get up accusations
against people, and threaten and frighten them out of their
money.”<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>One natural consequence of such a state of society and such
a perversion of justice is to render the people afraid of all contact
with the officers of government and exceedingly selfish in
all their intercourse, though the latter trait needs no particular
training to develop it in any heathen country. It also tends to
an inhuman disregard of the life of others, and chills every emotion
of kindness which might otherwise arise; for by making a
man responsible for the acts of his neighbors, or by involving a
whole village in the crimes of an individual, all sense of justice
is violated. The terror of being implicated in any evil that
takes place sometimes prevents the people from quenching fires
until the superior authorities be first informed, and from relieving
the distressed until it is often too late. Hence, too, it not
unfrequently happens that a man who has had the ill fortune to
be stabbed to death in the street, or who falls down from disease
and dies, remains on the spot till the putrescence obliges the
neighbors, for their own safety, to remove the corpse. A dead
body floating down the river and washing ashore is likely to remain
on the banks until it again drifts away or the authorities
get it buried, for no unofficial person would voluntarily run the
risk of being seen interring it. One censor reports that when
he asked the people why they did not remove the loathsome ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>ject,
they said: “We always let the bodies be either buried in
the bellies of fishes or devoured by the dogs; for if we inform
the magistrates they are sure to make the owner of the ground
buy a coffin, and the clerks and assistants distress us in a hundred
ways.” The usual end of these memorials and remonstrances
is that the police are ordered to behave better, the
clerks commanded to abstain from implicating innocent people
and retarding the course of justice, and their masters, the magistrates,
threatened with the Emperor’s displeasure in case the
grievance is not remedied: after which all goes on as before,
and will go on as long as both rulers and ruled are what they
are.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EFFECT OF MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY.</div>

<p>The working out of the principle of responsibility accounts
for many things in Chinese society and jurisprudence that otherwise
appear completely at variance with even common humanity.
It makes an officer careless of his duties if he can shift the responsibility
of failure upon his inferiors, who, at the same time,
he knows can never execute his orders; it renders the people
dead to the impulses of relationship, lest they become involved
in what they cannot possibly control and hardly know at the
time of its commission. Mr. Lindsay states that when he was
at Tsungming in 1832 the officers were very urgent that he
should go out of the river, and in order to show him the effect
of his non-compliance upon others a degraded subaltern was
paraded in his sight. “His cap with its gold button was borne
before him, and he marched about blindfolded in procession between
two executioners, with a small flag on a bamboo pierced
through each ear. Before him was a placard with the inscription,
‘By orders of the general of Su and Sung: for a breach
of military discipline, his ears are pierced as a warning to the
multitude.’ His offence was having allowed our boat to pass
the fort without reporting it.”</p>

<p>During the first war with England, fear of punishment induced
many of the subordinates to commit suicide when unable
to execute their orders, and the same motive impelled their
superiors to avoid the wrath of the Emperor in like fashion.
The hong-merchants and linguists at Canton, during the old
regime, were constantly liable, from the operation of this prin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>ciple,
to exactions and punishments for the acts of their foreign
customers. One of them, Sunshing, was put in prison and ruined
because Lord Napier came to Canton from Whampoa in the
boat of a ship which the unhappy merchant had “secured”
several weeks before, and the linguist and pilot were banished
for allowing what they could not possibly have hindered even
if they had known it.</p>

<p>Having examined in this general manner the various grades
of official rank, we come to the people; and a close view will
show that this great mass of human beings exhibits many equally
objectionable traits, while oppression, want, clannish rivalry,
and brigandage combine to keep it in a constant state of turmoil.
The subdivisions into tithings and hundreds are better
observed in rural districts than in cities, and the headmen of
those communities, in their individual and collective character,
possess great influence, from the fact that they represent the
popular feeling. In all parts of the country this popular organization
is found in some shape or other, though, as if everything
was somehow perverted, it not unfrequently is an instrument of
greater oppression than defence. The division of the people
into clans is far more marked in the southern provinces than in
those lying north of the Yangtsz’, and has had a depressing
effect upon their good government. It resembles in general the
arrangement of the Scottish clans, as do the evils arising from
their dissensions and feuds those which history records as excited
among the Highlanders by the rivalry between Campbells
and Macgregors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VILLAGE ELDERS.</div>

<p>The eldership of villages has no necessary connection with the
clans, for the latter are unacknowledged by the government, but
the clan having the majority in a village generally selects the
elders from among their number. This system is of very ancient
date; its elementary details are given in the <cite>Chau-lí</cite>, one of the
oldest works extant in China; Heeren furnishes the same details
for India and Raffles for Java, reaching back in their duration
to remote antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> In the vicinity of Canton the elder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
is elected by a sort of town meeting, and holds his office during
good behavior, receives such a salary as his fellow villagers give
him, and may be removed to make way for another whenever
the principal persons in the village are displeased with his conduct.
His duties are limited to the supervision of the police
and general oversight of what is done in the village, and to be a
sort of agent or spokesman between the villagers and higher authorities;
the duties, the power, and the rank of these officers
vary almost indefinitely. The preponderance of one clan prevents
much strife in the selection of the elder, but the degree of
power reposed in his hand is so small that there is probably little
competition to obtain the dignity. A village police is maintained
by the inhabitants, under the authority of the elder; the Village
of Whampoa, for instance, containing about eight thousand inhabitants,
pays the elder $300 salary, and employs fourteen
watchmen. His duties further consist in deciding upon the
petty questions arising between the villagers and visiting the
delinquents with chastisement, enforcing such regulations as are
deemed necessary regarding festivals, markets, tanks, streets,
collection of taxes, etc. The system of surveillance is, however,
kept up by the superior officers, who appoint excise officers, grain
agents, tide-waiters, or some other subordinate, as the case may
require, to exercise a general oversight of the headmen.</p>

<p>The district magistrate, with the <i>siunkien</i> and their deputies
over the hundred, are the officers to whom appeals are carried
from the headmen; they also receive the reports of the elders
respecting suspicious characters within their limits, or other
matters which they deem worthy of reference or remonstrance.
A similarity of interests leads the headmen of many villages
to meet together at times in a public hall for secret consultation
upon important matters, and their united resolutions are
generally acted upon by themselves or by the magistrates, as
the case may be. This system of eldership, and the influential
position the headmen occupy, is an important safeguard the
people possess against the extremity of oppressive extortion;
while, too, it upholds the government in strengthening the loyalty
of those who feel that the only security they possess against
theft, and loss of all things from their seditious countrymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
is to uphold the institutions of the land, and that to suffer the
evils of a bad magistracy is less dreadful than the horrors of a
lawless brigandage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOCIAL EVILS OF CLANSHIP.</div>

<p>The customs and laws of clanship perpetuate a sad state of
society, and render districts and villages, otherwise peaceful, the
scenes of unceasing turmoil and trouble. There are only about
four hundred clans in the whole of China, but inasmuch as all
of the same surname do not live in the same place, the separation
of a clan answers the same purpose as multiplying it. Clannish
feelings and feuds are very much stronger in Kwangtung
and Fuhkien than in other provinces. As an instance which
may be mentioned, the <cite>Gazette</cite> contains the petition of a man
from Chauchau fu, in Kwangtung, relating to a quarrel, stating
that “four years before, his kindred having refused to assist
two other clans in their feuds, had during that period suffered
most shocking cruelties. Ten persons had been killed, and
twenty men and women, taken captives, had had their eyes dug
out, their ears cut off, their feet maimed, and so rendered useless
for life. Thirty houses were laid in ruins and three hundred
acres of land seized, ten thousand taels plundered, ancestral
temples thrown down, graves dug up, dikes destroyed, and water
cut off from the fields. The governor had offered a reward of
a thousand taels to any one who would apprehend these persons,
but for the ten murders no one had been executed, for the
police dare not seize the offenders, whose numbers have largely
increased, and who set the laws at defiance.” This region is
notorious for the turbulence of its inhabitants; it adjoins the
province of Fuhkien, and the people, known at Canton as <i>Hoklo</i>,
emigrate in large numbers to the Indian Archipelago or to other
provinces. The later <cite>Gazettes</cite> contain still more dreadful accounts
of the contests of the clans, and the great loss of life and
property resulting from their forays, no less than one hundred
and twenty villages having been attacked, and thousands of
people killed. These battles are constantly occurring, and the
authorities, feeling themselves too weak to put them down, are
obliged to connive at them and let the clans fight it out.</p>

<p>Ill will is kept up between the clans, and private revenges
gratified, by every personal annoyance that malice can suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
or opportunity tempt. If an unfortunate individual of one clan
is met alone by his enemy, he is sure to be robbed or beaten, or
both; the boats or the houses of each party are plundered or
burned, and legal redress is almost impossible. Graves are defaced
and tombstones injured, and on the annual visit to the
family sepulchre perhaps a putrid corpse is met, placed there
by the hostile clan; this insult arouses all their ire, and they
vow deadly revenge. The villagers sally out with such arms as
they possess, and death and wounds are almost sure to result
before they separate. In Shunteh (a district between Canton
and Macao) upward of a thousand men engaged with spears
and firearms on one of these occasions, and thirty-six lives were
lost; the military were called in to quell the riot. In Tungkwan
district, southeast of Canton, thirty-six ringleaders were
apprehended, and in 1831 it was reported that four hundred
persons had been killed in these raids; only twenty-seven of
their kindred appealed to government for redress.</p>

<p>When complaint is made to the prefect or governor, and investigation
becomes inevitable, the villagers have a provision to
meet the exigencies of the case, which puts the burden of the
charges as equally as possible upon the whole clan. A band of
“devoted men” are found&mdash;persons who volunteer to assume
such crimes and run their chance for life&mdash;whose names are
kept on a list, and they come forward and surrender themselves
to government as the guilty persons. On the trial their friends
employ witnesses to prove it a justifiable homicide, and magnify
the provocation, and if there are several brought on the stand
at once they try to get some of them clear by proving an alibi.
It not unfrequently happens that the accused are acquitted&mdash;seldom
that they are executed; transportation or a fine is the
usual result. The inducement for persons to run this risk of
their lives is security from the clan of a maintenance for their
families in case of death, and a reward, sometimes as high as
$300, in land or money when they return. This sum is raised
by taxing the clan or village, and the imposition falls heavily
on the poorer portion of it, who can neither avoid nor easily
pay it. This system of substitution pervades all parts of society,
and for all misdemeanors. A person was strangled in Macao<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
in 1838 for having been engaged in the opium trade, who had
been hired by the real criminal to answer to his name. Another
mode of escape, sometimes tried in such cases when the
person has been condemned, is to bribe the jailers to report him
dead and carry out his body in a coffin; but this device probably
does not often answer the end, as the turnkeys require a
larger bribe than can be raised. There can be little doubt of the
prevalence of the practice, and for crimes of even minor penalty.</p>

<p>To increase the social evils of clanship and systematized
thieving, local tyrants occasionally spring up, persons who rob
and maltreat the villagers by means of their armed retainers,
who are in most cases, doubtless, members of the same clan.
One of these tyrants, named <i>Yeh</i>, or Leaf, became quite notorious
in the district of Tungkwan in 1833, setting at defiance
all the power of the local authorities, and sending out his men
to plunder and ravage whoever resisted his demands, destroying
their graves and grain, and particularly molesting those who
would not deliver up their wives or daughters to gratify him.
He was arrested through craft by the district magistrate at
Canton leaving his office and inducing him, for old acquaintance
sake, to return with him to the provincial city; he was there
tried and executed by the governor, although it was at the time
reported that the Board of Punishments endeavored to save his
life because he had been in office at the capital. In order that
no attempt should be made to rescue him, he was left in ignorance
of his sentence until he was put into the sedan to be carried
to execution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BANDITTI AND TRAMPS.</div>

<p>Clannish banditti often supply themselves with firearms, and
prowling the country to revenge themselves on their enemies,
soon proceed to pillage every one; in disarming them the government
is sometimes obliged to resort to contemptible subterfuges,
which conspicuously show its weakness and encourage a repetition
of the evil. Parties of tramps, called <i>hakka</i>, or ‘guests,’
roam over Kwangtung province, squatting on vacant places
along the shores, away from the villages, and forming small
clannish communities; as soon as they increase, occupying more
and more of the land, they begin to commit petty depredations
upon the crops of the inhabitants, and demand money for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
privilege of burying upon the unoccupied ground around them.
The government is generally unwilling to drive them off by
force, because there is the alternative of making them robbers
thereby, and they are invited to settle in other waste lands,
which they can have free of taxation, and leave those they have
cultivated if strictly private property. This practice shows the
populousness of the country in a conspicuous manner. To these
evils must be also added the large bodies of floating banditti or
dakoits, who rove up and down all the watercourses “like
sneaking rats” and pounce upon defenceless boats. Hardly a
river or estuary in the land is free from these miscreants, and
lives and property are annually destroyed by them to a very
great amount, especially on the Yangtsz’, the Pearl River, and
other great thoroughfares.</p>

<p>The popular associations in cities and towns are chiefly based
upon a community of interests, resulting either from a similarity
of occupation, when the leading persons of the same calling
form themselves into guilds, or from the municipal regulations
requiring the householders living in the same street to unite to
maintain a police and keep the peace of their division. Each
guild has an assembly-hall, where its members meet to hold the
festival of their patron saint, to collect and appropriate the subscriptions
of the members and settle the rent or storage on the
rooms and goods in the hall, to discuss all public matters as well
as the good cheer they get on such occasions, and to confer with
other guilds. The members often go to a great expense in
emulating each other in their processions, and some rivalry
exists regarding their rights, over which the government keeps
a watchful eye, for all popular assemblies are its horror. The
shopkeepers and householders in the same street are required to
have a headman to superintend the police, watchmen, and beggars
within his limits. The rulers are sometimes thwarted in
their designs by both these forms of popular assemblies, and they
no doubt tend in many ways to keep up a degree of independence
and of mutual acquaintance, which compels the respect of
the government. The governor of Canton in 1838 endeavored
to search all the shops in a particular street, to ascertain if there
was opium in them; but the shopmen came in a body at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
head of the street, and told the policemen that they would on
no account permit their shops to be searched. The governor
deemed it best to retire. Those who will not join or agree to
what the majority orders in these bodies occasionally experience
petty tyranny, but in a city this must be comparatively trifling.
Several of the leading men in the city are known to hold meetings
for consultation in still more popular assemblies for different
reasons of a public and pressing nature. There is a building
at Canton called the <i>Ming-lun Tang</i>, or “Free Discussion
Hall,” where political matters are discussed under the knowledge
of government, which rather tries to mould than put them
down, for the assistance of such bodies, rightly managed, in
carrying out their intentions, is considerable, while discontent
would be roused if they were forcibly suppressed. In October,
1842, meetings were held in this hall, at one of which a public
manifesto was issued, here quoted entire as a specimen of the
public appeals of Chinese politicians and orators:</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANIFESTO ISSUED AGAINST THE ENGLISH.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have been reverently consulting upon the Empire&mdash;a vast and undivided
whole! How can we permit it to be severed in order to give it to
others? Yet we, the rustic people, can learn to practise a rude loyalty; we
too know to destroy the banditti, and thus requite his Majesty. Our Great
Pure dynasty has cared for this country for more than two hundred years,
during which a succession of distinguished monarchs, sage succeeding sage,
has reigned; and we who eat the herb of the field, and tread the soil, have
for ages drank in the dew of imperial goodness, and been imbued with its
benevolence. The people in wilds far remote beyond our influence have
also felt this goodness, comparable to the heavens for height, and been upheld
by this bounty, like the earth for thickness. Wherefore peace being
now settled in the country, ships of all lands come, distant though they be
from this for many a myriad of miles; and of all the foreigners on the south
and west there is not one but what enjoys the highest peace and contentment,
and entertains the profoundest respect and submission.</p>

<p>“But there is that English nation, whose ruler is now a woman and then a
man, its people at one time like birds and then like beasts, with dispositions
more fierce and furious than the tiger or wolf, and hearts more greedy than
the snake or hog&mdash;this people has ever stealthily devoured all the southern
barbarians, and like the demon of the night they now suddenly exalt themselves.
During the reigns of Kienlung and Kiaking these English barbarians
humbly besought entrance and permission to make a present; they also presumptuously
requested to have Chusan, but those divine personages, clearly
perceiving their traitorous designs, gave them a peremptory refusal. From
that time, linking themselves in with traitorous traders, they have privily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
dwelt at Macao, trading largely in opium and poisoning our brave people.
They have ruined lives&mdash;how many millions none can tell; and wasted
property&mdash;how many thousands of millions who can guess! They have
dared again and again to murder Chinese, and have secreted the murderers,
whom they have refused to deliver up, at which the hearts of all men grieved
and their heads ached. Thus it has been that for many years past the English,
by their privily watching for opportunities in the country, have gradually
brought things to the present crisis.</p>

<p>“In 1838, our great Emperor having fully learned all the crimes of the
English and the poisonous effects of opium, quickly wished to restore the
good condition of the country and compassionate the people. In consequence
of the memorial of Hwang Tsioh-sz’, and in accordance to his request, he
specially deputed the public-minded, upright, and clear-headed minister, Lin
Tseh-sü, to act as his imperial commissioner with plenipotentiary powers, and
go to Canton to examine and regulate. He came and took all the stored-up
opium and stopped the trade, in order to cleanse the stream and cut
off the fountain; kindness was mixed with his severity, and virtue was
evident in his laws, yet still the English repented not of their errors, and
as the climax of their contumacy called troops to their aid. The censor
Hwang, by advising peace, threw down the barriers, and bands of audacious
robbers willingly did all kinds of disreputable and villainous deeds. During
the past three years these rebels, depending upon their stout ships and effective
cannon, from Canton went to Fuhkien, thence to Chehkiang and on
to Kiangsu, seizing our territory, destroying our civil and military authorities,
ravishing our women, capturing our property, and bringing upon the inhabitants
of these four provinces intolerable miseries. His Imperial Majesty was
troubled and afflicted, and this added to his grief and anxiety. If you wish
to purify their crimes, all the fuel in the Empire will not suffice, nor would
the vast ocean be enough to wash out our resentment. Gods and men are
alike filled with indignation, and Heaven and Earth cannot permit them to
remain.</p>

<p>“Recently, those who have had the management of affairs in Kiangnan
have been imitating those who were in Canton, and at the gates of the city
they have willingly made an agreement, peeling off the fat of the people to
the tune of hundreds of myriads, and all to save the precious lives of one or
two useless officers; in doing which they have exactly verified what Chancellor
Kin Ying-lin had before memorialized. Now these English rebels are barbarians
dwelling in a petty island beyond our domains; yet their coming
throws myriads of miles of country into turmoil, while their numbers do not
exceed a few myriads. What can be easier than for our celestial dynasty to
exert its fulness of power and exterminate these contemptible sea-going imps,
just as the blast bends the pliant bamboo? But our highest officers and
ministers cherish their precious lives, and civil and military men both dread
a dog as they would a tiger; regardless of the enemies of their country or the
griefs of the people, they have actually sundered the Empire and granted its
wealth; acts more flagitious these than those of the traitors in the days of the
Southern Sung dynasty, and the reasons for which are wholly beyond our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
comprehension. These English barbarians are at bottom without ability, and
yet we have all along seen in the memorials that officers exalt and dilate upon
their prowess and obstinacy; our people are courageous and enthusiastic, but
the officers on the contrary say that they are dispirited and scattered: this is
for no other reason than to coerce our prince to make peace, and then they
will luckily avoid the penalty due for ‘deceiving the prince and betraying the
country.’ Do you doubt? Then look at the memorial of Chancellor Kin
Ying-lin, which says: ‘They take the occasion of war to seek for self-aggrandizement;’
every word of which directly points at such conduct as this.</p>

<p>“We have recently read in his Majesty’s lucid mandate that ‘There is no
other way, and what is requested must be granted;’ and that ‘We have conferred
extraordinary powers upon the ministers, and they have done nothing
but deceive us.’ Looking up we perceive his Majesty’s clear discrimination
and divine perception, and that he was fully aware of the imbecility of his
ministers; he remembers too the loyal anger of his people. He has accordingly
now temporarily settled all the present difficulties, but it is that, having
matured his plans, he may hereafter manifest his indignation, and show to
the Empire that it had not fathomed the divine awe-inspiring counsels.</p>

<p>“The dispositions of these rebellious English are like that of the dog or
sheep, whose desires can never be satisfied; and therefore we need not inquire
whether the peace now made be real or pretended. Remember that
when they last year made disturbance at Canton they seized the Square fort,
and thereupon exhibited their audacity, everywhere plundering and ravishing.
If it had not been that the patriotic inhabitants dwelling in Hwaitsing
and other hamlets, and those in Shingping, had not killed their leader and
destroyed their devilish soldiers, they would have scrupled at nothing, taking
and pillaging the city, and then firing it in order to gratify their vengeance
and greediness: can we imagine that for the paltry sum of six millions of
dollars they would, as they did, have raised the siege and retired? How to
be regretted! That when the fish was in the frying-pan, the Kwangchau fu
should come and pull away the firewood, let loose the tiger to return to the
mountains, and disarm the people’s indignation. Letting the enemy thus
escape on one occasion has successively brought misery upon many provinces:
whenever we speak of it, it wounds the heart and causes the tears to flow.</p>

<p>“Last year, when the treaty of peace was made, it was agreed that the English
should withdraw from beyond Lankeet, that they should give back the
forts near there and dwell temporarily at Hongkong, and that thenceforth all
military operations were forever to cease. Who would have supposed that before
the time stipulated had passed away they would have turned their
backs upon this agreement, taken violent possession of the forts at the Bogue
with their ‘wooden dragons’ [<i>i.e.</i>, ships of war]&mdash;and when they came upon the
gates of the City of Rams with their powerful forces, who was there to oppose
them? During these three years we have not been able to restore things as
at first, and their deceptive craftiness, then confined to these regions, has
rapidly extended itself to Kiangnan. But our high and mighty Emperor, pre-eminently
intelligent and discerning [<i>lit.</i> grasping the golden mirror and holding
the gemmeous balances], consents to demean himself to adopt soothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
counsels of peace, and therefore submissively accords with the decrees of
Heaven. Having a suspicion that these outlandish people intended to encroach
upon us, he has secretly arranged all things. We have respectfully
read through all his Majesty’s mandates, and they are as clear-sighted as the
sun and moon; but those who now manage affairs are like one who, supposing
the raging fire to be under, puts himself as much at ease as swallows in a
court, but who, if the calamity suddenly reappears, would be as defenceless
as a grampus in a fish-market. The law adjudges the penalty of death for betraying
the country, but how can even death atone for their crimes? Those
persons who have been handed down to succeeding ages with honor, and those
whose memories have been execrated, are but little apart on the page of
righteous history; let our rulers but remember this, and we think they also
must exert themselves to recover their characters. We people have had our
day in times of great peace, and this age is one of abundant prosperity;
scholars are devising how to recompense the kindness of the government, nor
can husbandmen think of forgetting his Majesty’s exertions for them. Our
indignation was early excited to join battle with the enemy, and we then all
urged one another to the firmest loyalty.</p>

<p>“We have heard the English intend to come into Pearl River and make a
settlement; this will not, however, stop at Chinese and foreigners merely
dwelling together, for men and beasts cannot endure each other; it will be
like opening the door and bowing in the thief, or setting the gate ajar and
letting the wolf in. While they were kept outside there were many traitors
within; how much more, when they encroach even to our bedsides, will our
troubles be augmented? We cannot help fearing it will eventuate in something
strange, which words will be insufficient to express. If the rulers of
other states wish to imitate the English, with what can their demands be
waived? Consequently, the unreasonable demands of the English are going
to bring great calamity upon the people and deep sorrow to the country. If
we do not permit them to dwell with us under the same heaven, our spirits
will feel no shame; but if we willingly consent to live with them, we may in
truth be deemed insensate.</p>

<p>“We have reverently read in the imperial mandate, ‘There must indeed
be some persons among the people of extraordinary wisdom or bravery, who
can stir them up to loyalty and patriotism or unite them in self-defence;
some who can assist the government and army to recover the cities, or else
defend passes of importance against the robbers; some who can attack and
burn their vessels, or seize and bring the heads of their doltish leaders; or
else some with divine presence and wisdom, who can disclose all their silly
counsels and get to themselves a name of surpassing merit and ability and
receive the highest rewards. We can confer,’ etc., etc. We, the people, having
received the imperial words, have united ourselves together as troops, and
practise the plan of joining hamlets and villages till we have upward of a
million of troops, whom we have provisioned according to the scale of estimating
the produce of respective farms; and now we are fully ready and quite
at ease as to the result. If nothing calls us, then each one will return to his
own occupation; but if the summons come, joining our strength in force we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
will incite each other to effort; our brave sons and brothers are all animated
to deeds of arms, and even our wives and daughters, finical and delicate as
jewels, have learned to discourse of arms. At first, alas, those who guarded
the passes were at ease and careless, and the robbers came unbidden and undesired;
but now [if they come], we have only zealously to appoint each other
to stations, and suppress the rising of the waves to the stillest calm [<i>i.e.</i>, to exterminate
them]. When the golden pool is fully restored to peace, and his
Majesty’s anxiety for the south relieved; when the leviathan has been driven
away, then will our anger, comparable to the broad ocean and high heavens,
be pacified.</p>

<p>“Ah! We here bind ourselves to vengeance, and express these our sincere
intentions in order to exhibit great principles; and also to manifest Heaven’s
retribution and rejoice men’s hearts, we now issue this patriotic declaration.
The high gods clearly behold: do not lose your first resolution.”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p></div>

<p>This spirited paper was subsequently answered by the party
desirous of peace, but the anti-English feeling prevailed, and
the committee appointed by the meeting set the English
consulate on fire a few days after, to prevent it being occupied.
There were many reasons at the time for this dislike;
its further exhibition, however, ended with this attack, and
has now pretty much died out with the rising of a new generation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPULAR SECRET ASSOCIATIONS.</div>

<p>The many secret associations existing among the people are
mostly of a political character, but have creeds like religious
sects, and differ slightly in their tenets and objects of worship.
They are traceable to the system of clans, which giving the
people at once the habit and spirit for associations, are easily
made use of by clever men for their own purposes of opposition
to government. Similar grievances, as local oppression, hatred
of the Manchus, or hope of advantage, add to their numbers and
strength, and were they founded on a full acquaintance with
the grounds of a just resistance to despotism, they would soon
overturn the government; but as out of an adder’s egg only a
cockatrice can be hatched, so until the people are enlightened
with regard to their just rights, no permanent melioration can
be expected. It is against that leading feature in the Manchu
policy, <em>isolation</em>, that these societies sin, which further prompts
to systematic efforts to suppress them. The only objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
the supreme government seems to have against the religion of
the people is that it brings them together; they may be Buddhists,
Rationalists, Jews, Mohammedans, or Christians, apparently,
if they will worship in secret and apart. On the other
hand, the people naturally connect some religious rites with
their opposition and cabals in order to more securely bind their
members together.</p>

<p>The name of the most powerful of these associations is mentioned
in Section CLXII. of the code for the purpose of interdicting
it; since then it has apparently changed its designation
from the <i>Pih-lien kiao</i>, or ‘Water-lily sect,’ to the <i>Tien-tí hwui</i>
or <i>San-hoh hwui</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Triad society,’ though both names still
exist, the former in the northern, the latter in the maritime
provinces and Indian Archipelago; their ramifications take
also other appellations. The object of these combinations is to
overturn the reigning dynasty, and in putting this prominently
forward they engage many to join them. About the beginning
of the century a wide-spread rebellion broke out in the north-western
and middle provinces, which was put down after eight
years’ war, attended with desolation and bloodshed; since that
time the Water-lily sect has not been so often spoken of. The
Triad society has extended itself along the coasts, but it is
not popular, owing more than anything else to its illegality, and
the intimidation and oppression employed toward those who
will not join it. The members have secret regulations and
signs, and uphold and assist each other both in good and bad
acts, but, as might be inferred from their character, screening
evil doers from just punishment oftener than relieving distressed
members. The original designs of the association may
have been good, but what was allowable in them soon degenerated
into a systematic plan for plunder and aim at power.
The government of Hongkong enacted in 1845 that any Chinese
living in that colony who was ascertained to belong to the
Triad society should be declared guilty of felony, be imprisoned
for three years, and after branding expelled the colony.
These associations, if they cause the government much trouble
by interfering with its operations, in no little degree, through
the overbearing conduct of the leaders, uphold it by showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
the people what may be expected if they should ever get the
upper hand.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MEMORIAL UPON OFFICIAL OPPRESSION.</div>

<p>The evils of mal-administration are to be learned chiefly
from the memorials of censors, and although they may color
their statements a little, very gross inaccuracies would be used
to their own disadvantage, and contradicted by so many competitors,
that most of their statements may be regarded as having
some foundation. An unknown person in Kwangtung memorialized
the Emperor in 1838 concerning the condition of that
province, and drew a picture of the extortions of the lower
agents of government that needs no illustrations to deepen its
darkness or add force to its complaints. An extract from each
of the six heads into which the memorial is divided will indicate
the principal sources of popular insurrection in China,
besides the exhibition they give of the tyranny of the officers.</p>

<p>In his preface, after the usual laudation of the beneficence
and popularity of the monarch, the memorialist proceeds to express
his regret that the imperial desires for the welfare of his
subjects should be so grievously thwarted by the villany of his
officers. After mentioning the calamities which had visited the
province in the shape of freshets, insurrections, and conflagrations,
he says that affairs generally had become so bad as to
compel his Majesty to send commissioners to Canton repeatedly
in order to regulate them. “If such as this be indeed the state
of things,” he inquires, “what wonder is it if habits of plunder
characterize the people, or the clerks and under officers of the
public courts, as well as village pettifoggers, lay themselves out
on all occasions to stir up quarrels and instigate false accusations
against the good?” He recommends reform in six departments,
under each of which he thus specifies the evils to be
remedied:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>
<p><em>First.</em>&mdash;In the department of police there is great negligence
and delay in the decision of judicial cases. Cases of plunder
are very common, most of which are committed by banditti
under the designations of Triad societies, Heaven and Earth
brotherhoods, etc. These men carry off persons to extort a
ransom, falsely assume the character of policemen, and in simulated
revenue cutters pass up and down the rivers, plundering
the boats of travellers and forcibly carrying off the women.
Husbandmen are obliged to pay these robbers an “indemnity,”
or else as soon as the crops are ripe they come and carry off
the whole harvest. In the precincts of the metropolis, where
their contiguity to the tribunals prevents their committing depredations
in open day, they set fire to houses during the night,
and under the pretence of saving and defending the persons and
property carry off both of them; hence, of late years, calamitous
fires have increased in frequency, and the bands of robbers
multiplied greatly. In cases of altercations among the villagers,
who can only use their local patois, it rests entirely with the
clerks to interpret the evidence; and when the magistrate is lax
or pressed with business, they have the evidence pre-arranged
and join with bullies and strife-makers to subvert right and
wrong, fattening themselves upon bribes extorted under the
names of “memoranda of complaints,” “purchases of replies,”
etc., and retarding indefinitely the decision of cases. They also
instigate thieves to bring false accusations against the good, who
are thereby ruined by legal expenses. While the officers of the
government and the people are thus separated, how can it be
otherwise than that appeals to the higher tribunals should be
increased and litigation and strife prevail?</p>

<p><em>Second.</em>&mdash;Magistrates overrate the taxes with a view to a deduction
for their own benefit, and excise officers connive at
non-payment. The revenue of Kwangtung is paid entirely in
money, and the magistrates, instead of taking the commutation
at a regular price of about five dollars for one hundred and fifty
pounds of rice, have compelled the people to pay nine dollars
and over, because the inundation and bad harvests had raised
the price of grain. In order to avoid this extortion the police go
to the villagers and demand a douceur, when they will get them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
off from all payment. But the imperial coffers are not filled by
this means, and the people are by and by forced to pay up their
arrearages, even to the loss of most of their possessions.</p>

<p><em>Third.</em>&mdash;There is great mismanagement of the granaries, and
instead of being any assistance to the people in time of scarcity,
they are only a source of peculation for those who are charged
with their oversight.</p>

<p><em>Fourth.</em>&mdash;The condition of the army and navy is a disgrace;
illicit traffic is not prevented, nor can insurrections be put down.
The only care of the officers is to obtain good appointments,
and reduce the actual number of soldiers below the register in
order that they may appropriate the stores. The cruisers aim
only to get fees to allow the prosecution of the contraband traffic,
nor will the naval officers bestir themselves to recover the
property of plundered boats, but rather become the protectors
of the lawless and partakers of their booty. Robberies are so
common on the rivers that the traders from the island of Hainan,
and Chauchau near Fuhkien, prefer to come by sea, but
the revenue cutters overhaul them under pretence of searching
for contraband articles, and practise many extortions.</p>

<p><em>Fifth.</em>&mdash;The monopoly of salt needs to be guarded more
strictly, and the private manufacture of salt stopped, for thereby
the revenue from this source is materially diminished.</p>

<p><em>Sixth.</em>&mdash;The increase of smuggling is so great, and the evils
flowing from it so multiplied, that strong measures must be
taken to repress it. Traitorous Chinese combine with depraved
foreigners to set the laws at defiance, and dispose of their opium
and other commodities for the pure silver. In this manner the
country is impoverished and every evil arises, the revenues of
the customs are diminished by the unnecessary number of persons
employed and by the fees they receive for connivance. If
all these abuses can be remedied, “it will be seen that when
there are men to rule well, nothing can be found beyond the
reach of their government.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">FREQUENCY OF ROBBERY AND DAKOITY.</div>

<p>The chief efforts of officials are directed to put down banditti,
and maintain such a degree of peace as will enable them to collect
the revenue and secure the people in the quiet possession
of their property; but the people are too ready to resist their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
rulers, and this brings into operation a constant struggle of opposing
desires. One side gets into the habit of resisting even
the proper requisitions of the officers, who, on their part, endeavor
in every way to reimburse their outlay in bribes to their
superiors; and the combined action of the two proves an insurmountable
impediment to the attainment of even that degree of
security a Chinese officer wishes. The general commission of
robbery and dakoity, and the prevalence of bands of thieves,
therefore proves the weakness of the government, not the insurrectionary
disposition of the people. In one district of
Hupeh the governor reported in 1828 that “very few of the
inhabitants have any regular occupation, and their dispositions
are exceedingly ferocious; they fight and kill each other on
every provocation. In their villages they harbor thieves who
flee from other districts, and sally forth again to plunder.” In
the northern parts of Kwangtung the people have erected high
and strongly built houses to which they flee for safety from
the attacks of robbers. These bands sometimes fall upon each
other, and the feudal animosities of clanship adding fuel and
rage to the rivalry of partisan warfare, the destruction of life
and property is great. Occasionally the people zealously assist
their rulers to apprehend them, though their exertions depend
altogether upon the energy of the incumbent; an officer in
Fuhkien is recommended for promotion because he had apprehended
one hundred and seventy-three persons, part of a band
of robbers which had infested the department for years, and
tried and convicted one thousand one hundred and sixty criminals,
most or all of whom were probably executed.</p>

<p>In 1821 there were four hundred robbers taken on the borders
of Fuhkien; in 1827 two hundred were seized in the
south of the province, and forty-one more brought to Canton
from the eastward. The governor offered $1,000 reward for
the capture of one leader, and $3,000 for another. The judge
of the province put forth a proclamation upon the subject in
the same year, in which he says there were four hundred and
thirty undecided cases of robbery by brigands then on the calendar;
and in 1846 there were upward of two thousand waiting
his decision, for each of which there were perhaps five or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
six persons in prison or under constraint until the case was settled.
These bands prowl in the large cities and commit great
cruelties. In 1830 a party of five hundred openly plundered a
rich man’s house in the western suburbs of Canton; and in
Shunteh, south of the city, $600 were paid for the ransom of
two persons carried off by them. The ex-governor, in 1831,
was attacked by them near the Mei ling pass on his departure
from Canton, and plundered of about ten thousand dollars.
The magistrates of Hiangshan district, south of Canton, were
ordered by their superiors the same year to apprehend five
hundred of the robbers. Priests sometimes harbor gangs in
their temples and divide the spoils with them, and occasionally
go out themselves on predatory excursions. No mercy is
shown these miscreants when they are taken, but the multiplication
of executions has no effect in deterring them from crime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIFFICULTY IN COLLECTING TAXES.</div>

<p>Cruelty to individual prisoners does not produce so much disturbance
to the general peace of the community as the forcible
attempts of officers to collect taxes. The people have the impression
that their rulers exact more than is legal, and consequently
consider opposition to the demands of the tax-gatherer
as somewhat justifiable, which compels, of course, more stringent
measures on the part of the authorities, whose station depends
not a little on their punctuality in remitting the taxes. Bad
harvests, floods, or other public calamities render the people
still more disinclined to pay the assessments. In 1845 a serious
disturbance arose near Ningpo on this account, which with unimportant
differences could probably be paralleled in every prefecture
in the land. The people of Funghwa hien having refused
to pay an onerous tax, the prefect of Ningpo seized three
literary men of the place, who had been deputed to collect it,
and put them in prison; this procedure so irritated the gentry
that the candidates at the literary examination which occurred
at Funghwa soon afterward, on being assembled at the
public hall before the <i>chíhien</i>, rose upon him and beat him severely.
They were still further incensed against him from
having recently detected him in deceitful conduct regarding a
petition they had made at court to have their taxes lightened;
he had kept the answer and pocketed the difference. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
consequently superseded by another magistrate, and a deputy of
the intendant of circuit was sent with the new incumbent to restore
order. But the deputy, full of his importance, carried
himself so haughtily that the excited populace treated him in
the same manner, and he barely escaped with his life to Ningpo.
The intendant and prefect, finding matters rising to such a
pitch, sent a detachment of twelve hundred troops to keep the
peace, but part of these were decoyed within the walls and attacked
with such vigor that many of them were made prisoners,
a colonel and a dozen privates killed, and two or three hundred
wounded or beaten, and all deprived of their arms. In this
plight they returned to Ningpo, and, as the distance is not great,
apprehensions were entertained lest the insurgents should follow
up their advantage by organizing themselves and marching
upon the city to seize the prefect. The officers sent immediately
to Hangchau for assistance, from whence the governor
sent a strong force of ten thousand men to restore order, and
soon after arrived himself. He demanded three persons to be
given up who had been active in fomenting the resistance,
threatening in case of non-compliance that he would destroy the
town; the prefect and his deputy from the intendant’s office
were suspended and removed to another post. These measures
restored quiet to a considerable extent.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>The existence of such evils in Chinese society would rapidly
disorganize it were it not for the conservative influence upon
society of early education and training in industry. The government
takes care to avail itself of this better element in public
opinion, and grounds thereon a basis of action for the establishment
of good order. But this, and ten thousand similar
instances, only exhibit more strongly how great a work there is
to be done before high and low, people and rulers, will understand
their respective duties and rights; before they will, on
the one hand, pay that regard to the authority of their rulers
which is necessary for the maintenance of good order, and, on
the other, resist official tyranny in preserving their own liberties.</p>

<p>If the character of the officers, therefore, be such as has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
briefly shown&mdash;open to bribery, colluding with criminals, sycophantic
toward superiors, and cruel to the people; and the constituents
of society present so many repulsive features&mdash;opposing
clans engaged in deadly feuds, bandits scouring the country
to rob, policemen joining to oppress, truth universally disregarded,
selfishness the main principle of action, and almost
every disorganizing element but imperfectly restrained from
violent outbreaks and convulsions, it will not be expected that
the regular proceedings of the courts and the execution of the
laws will prove on examination to be any better than the materials
of which they are composed. As civil and criminal cases
are all judged by one officer, one court tries nearly all the questions
which arise. A single exception is provided for in the
code, wherein it is ordered that “in cases of adultery, robbery,
fraud, assaults, breach of laws concerning marriage, landed
property or pecuniary contracts, or any other like offences
committed by or against individuals in the military class&mdash;if
any of the people are implicated or concerned, the military
commanding officer and the civil magistrate shall have a concurrent
jurisdiction.”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.</div>

<p>At the bottom of the judicial scale are the village elders.
This incipient element of the democratic principle has also existed
in India in much the same form; but while its power
ended in the local eldership there, in China it is only the lowest
step of the scale. The elders give character to the village, and
are expected to manage its public affairs, settle disputes among
its inhabitants, arrange matters with other villages, and answer
to the magistrates on its behalf. The code provides that all
persons having complaints and informations address themselves
in the first instance to the lowest tribunal of justice in the district,
from which the cognizance of the affair may be transferred
to the superior tribunals. The statement of the case is made in
writing, and the officer is required to act upon it immediately;
if the parties are dissatisfied with the award, the judgment of
the lower courts is carried up to the superior ones. No case can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
be carried directly to the Emperor; it must go through the
Board of Punishments; old men and women, however, sometimes
present petitions to him on his journeys, but such appeals
seldom occur, owing to the difficulty of access. The captains in
charge of the gates of Peking, in 1831, presented a memorial
upon the subject, in which they attribute the number of appeals
to the obstinacy of many persons in pressing their cases and
the remissness of local officers, so that even women and girls of
ten years of age take long journeys to Peking to state their
cases. The memorialists recommend that an order be issued requiring
the two high provincial officers to adjudicate all cases,
either themselves or by a court of errors, and not send the complainants
back to the district magistrates. These official porters
must have been much troubled with young ladies coming to see
his Majesty, or perhaps were advised to present such a paper to
afford a text for the Emperor to preach from; to confer such
power upon the governor and his associates would almost make
them the irresponsible sovereigns of the provinces. Appeals
frequently arise out of delay in obtaining justice, owing to the
amount of business in the courts; for the calendar may be
expected to increase when the magistrate leaves his post to
curry favor with his superiors. The almost utter impossibility
of learning the truth of the case brought before them, either
from the principal parties or the witnesses, must be borne in
mind when deciding upon the oppressive proceedings of the
magistrates to elicit the truth. Mention is made of one officer
promoted for deciding three hundred cases in a year; again of
a district magistrate who tried upward of a thousand within
the same period; while a third revised and decided more than
six hundred in which the parties had appealed. What becomes
of the appeals in such cases, or whose decision stands, does not
appear; but if such proceedings are common, it accounts for the
constant practice of sending appeals back to be revised, probably
after a change in the incumbent.</p>

<p>Few or no civil cases are reported in the <cite>Gazette</cite> as being
carried up to higher courts, and probably only a small proportion
of them are brought before the authorities, the rest being
settled by reference. Appeals to court receive attention, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
may be inferred, too, that many of them are mentioned in the
<cite>Gazette</cite> in order that the carefulness of the supreme government
in revising the unjust decrees against the people should be
known through the country, and this additional check to malversation
on the part of the lower courts be of some use. Many
cases are reported of widows and daughters, sons and nephews,
of murdered persons, to whom the revenge of kindred rightly
belongs, appealing against the unjust decrees of the local magistrates,
and then sent back to the place they came from; this, of
course, was tantamount to a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolle prosequi</i>. At other times the
wicked judges have been degraded and banished. One case is
reported of a man who found his way to the capital from Fuhkien
to complain against the magistracy and police, who protected
a clan by whom his only son had been shot, in consideration
of a bribe of $2,000. His case could not be understood
at Peking in consequence of his local pronunciation, which
indicates that all cases are not reported in writing. One
appeal is reported against the governor of a province for not
carrying into execution the sentence of death passed on two
convicted murderers; and another appellant requests that two
persons, who were bribed to undergo the sentence of the law
instead of the real murderers, might not be substituted&mdash;he,
perhaps, fearing their subsequent vengeance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STYLE OF OFFICIAL ESTABLISHMENTS.</div>

<p>All officers of government are supposed to be accessible at
any time, and the door of justice to be open to all who claim a
hearing; and in fact, courts are held at all hours of night and
day, though the regular time is from sunrise to noonday. The
style of address varies according to the rank; <i>tajin</i>, or magnate,
for the highest, <i>ta laoyé</i>, or great Sir, and <i>laoyé</i>, Sir, for the
lower grade, are the most common. A drum is said to be
placed at the inferior tribunals, as well as before the Court of
Representation in Peking, which the plaintiff strikes in order to
make his presence known, though from the number of hangers-on
about the doors of official residences, the necessity of employing
this mode of attracting notice is rare. At the gate of the
governor-general’s palace are placed six tablets, having appropriate
inscriptions for those who have been wronged by wicked
officers; for those who have suffered from thieves; for persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
falsely accused; for those who have been swindled; for such as
have been grieved by other parties; and lastly, for those who
have secret information to impart. The people, however, are
aware how useless it would be to inscribe their appeals upon
these tablets; they write them out and carry them up to his
excellency, or to the proper official&mdash;seldom forgetting the indispensable
present.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Mode of Carrying High Officers in Sedan.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Magistrates are not allowed to go abroad in ordinary dress
and without their official retinue, which varies for the different
grades of rank. The usual attendants of the district magistrates
are lictors with whips and chains&mdash;significant of the
punishments they inflict; they are preceded by two gong-bearers,
who every few moments strike a certain number of
raps to intimate their master’s rank, and by two avant-couriers,
who howl out an order for all to make room for the great man.
A servant bearing aloft a <i>lo</i>, or state umbrella (of which a
drawing is given on the <a href="#Illustration_THE_MK">title-page</a>), also goes before him, further
to increase his display and indicate his rank.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> A subaltern
usually runs by the side of his sedan, and his secretary and messengers,
seated in more ordinary chairs or following on foot,
make up the cortége. The highest officers are carried by eight
bearers, others by four, and the lowest by two. Lanterns are
used at night and red tablets in the daytime, to indicate his
rank. Officers of higher ranks are attended by a few soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
in addition, and in the capital are required to have mounted
attendants if they ride in carts; those who bear the sedan are
usually in a uniform of their master’s devising. The parade
and noise seen in the provinces are all hushed in Peking, where
the presence of majesty subdues the glory of the officers which
it has created. When in court the officer sits behind a desk upon
which are placed writing materials; his secretaries, clerks, and interpreters
being in waiting, and the lictors with their instruments
of punishment and torture standing around. Persons who are
brought before him kneel in front of the tribunal. His official
seal, and cups containing tallies which are thrown down to indicate
the number of blows to be given the culprits, stand upon
the table, and behind his seat a <i>kí-lin</i>, or unicorn, is depicted
on the wall. There are inscriptions hanging around the room,
one of which exhorts him to be merciful. There is little pomp
or show, either in the office or attendants, compared with our
notions of what is usual in such matters among Asiatics. The
former is a dirty, unswept, tawdry room, and the latter are beggarly
and impertinent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MODE OF PROCEDURE IN LAW COURTS.</div>

<p>No counsel is allowed to plead, but the written accusations,
pleas, or statements required must be prepared by licensed
notaries, who may also read them in court, and who, no doubt,
take opportunity to explain circumstances in favor of their
client. These notaries buy their situations, and repay themselves
by a fee upon the documents; they are the only persons
who are analogous to the lawyers in western countries, and
most of them have the reputation of extorting largely for their
services. Of course there is no such thing as a jury, or a chief
justice stating the case to associate judges to learn their
opinion; nor is anything like an oath required of the witnesses.</p>

<p>The presiding officer can call in others to assist him in the
trial to any extent he pleases. In one Canton court circular it
is stated that no less than sixteen officers assisted the governor-general
and governor in the trial of one criminal. The report of
the trial is as summary as the recital of the bench of judges is
minute: “H. E. Gov. Tăng arrived to join the futai in examining
a criminal; and at 8 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, under a salute of guns, the
doors of the great hall of audience were thrown open, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
excellencies took their seats, supported by all the other functionaries
assembled for the occasion. The police officers of the
judge were then directed to bring forward the prisoner, Yeh
A-shun, a native of Tsingyuen hien; he was forthwith brought
in, tried, and led out. The futai then requested the imperial
death-warrant, and sent a deputation of officers to conduct the
criminal to the market-place and there decapitate him. Soon
after the officers returned, restored the death-warrant to its
place, and reported that they had executed the criminal.” The
prisoner, or his friends for him, are allowed to appear in every
step of the inquiry prior to laying the case before the Emperor,
and punishment is threatened to all the magistrates through
whose hands it passes if they neglect the appeal; but this
extract shows the usage of the courts.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>PRISONER CONDEMNED TO THE CANGUE, IN COURT.</p>

<p>(His son praying to take his place.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The general policy of officers is to quash cases and repress
appeals, and probably they do so to a great degree by bringing
extorted confessions of the accused party and the witnesses in
proof of the verdict. Governor Lí of Canton issued a prohibition
in 1834 against the practice of old men and women presenting
petitions&mdash;complaining of the nuisance of having his chair
stopped in order that a petition might be forced into it, and
threatening to seize and punish the presumptuous intruders if
they persisted in this custom. He instructs the district magistrates
to examine such persons, to ascertain who pushed them
forward, and to punish the instigators, observing, “if the people
are impressed with a due dread of punishment, they will return
to respectful habits.” It seems to be the constant effort
on the part of the officers to evade the importunities of the injured
and shove by justice, and were it not owing to the perseverance
of the people, a system of irremediable oppression
would soon be induced. But the poor have little chance of
being heard against the rich, and if they do appeal they are in
most cases remanded to the second judgment of the very officer
against whom they complain; and of course as this is equivalent
to a refusal from the high grades to right them at all, commotions
gradually grow out of it, which are managed according
to the exigencies of the case by those who are likely to be involved
in their responsibility. The want of an irresistible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
police to compel obedience has a restraining effect on the rulers,
who know that Lynch law may perhaps be retaliated upon
them if they exasperate the people too far. A prefect was
killed in Chauchau fu some years ago for his cruelty, and the
people excused their act by saying that it was done because the
officer had failed to carry out the Emperor’s good rule, and they
would not endure it longer. Amid such enormities it is no
wonder if the peaceably disposed part of the community prefer
to submit in silence to petty extortions and robberies, rather
than risk the loss of all by unavailing complaints.</p>

<p>The code contains many sections regulating the proceedings
of courts, and provides heavy punishments for such officers as
are guilty of illegalities or cruelty in their decisions, but the recorded
cases prove that most of these laws are dead letters.
Section CCCCXVI. ordains that “after a prisoner has been tried
and convicted of any offence punishable with temporary or perpetual
banishment or death, he shall, in the last place, be
brought before the magistrate, together with his nearest relations
and family, and informed of the offence whereof he
stands convicted, and of the sentence intended to be pronounced
upon him in consequence; their acknowledgment of its justice
or protest against its injustice, as the case may be, shall then be
taken down in writing: and in every case of their refusing to
admit the justice of the sentence, their protest shall be made
the ground of another and more particular investigation.” All
capital cases must be reviewed by the highest authorities at the
metropolis and in the provinces, and a final report of the case
and decision submitted to the Emperor’s notice. Section
CCCCXV. requires that the law be quoted when deciding. The
numerous wise and merciful provisions in the code for the due
administration of justice only place the conduct of its authorized
executives in a less excusable light, and prove how impossible it
is to procure an equitable magistracy by mere legal requirements
and penalties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MODES AND EXTENT OF TORTURING CULPRITS.</div>

<p>The confusion of the civil and criminal laws in the code, and
the union of both functions in the same person, together with
the torture and imprisonment employed to elicit a confession,
serve as an indication of the state of legislation and jurispru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>dence.
The common sense of a truthful people would revolt
against the infliction of torture to get out the true deposition of
a witness, and their sense of honor would resist the disgraceful
exposure of the cangue for not paying debts. As the want of
truth among a people indicates a want of honor, the necessity
of more stringent modes of procedure suggests the practice of
torture; its application is allowed and restricted by several sections
of the code, but in China, as elsewhere, it has always
been abused. Torture is practised upon both criminals and
witnesses, in court and in prison; and the universal dread among
the people of coming before courts, and having anything to do
with their magistrates, is owing in great measure to the illegal
sufferings they too often must endure. It has also a powerful
deterrent effect in preventing crime and disorder. Neither imprisonment
nor torture are ranked among the five punishments,
but they cause more deaths, probably, among arrested persons
than all other means.</p>

<p>Among the modes of torture employed in court, and reported
in the <cite>Gazette</cite>, are some revolting to humanity, but which of
them are legal does not appear. The clauses under Section I.
in the code describe the legal instruments of torture; they consist
of three boards with proper grooves for compressing the
ankles, and five round sticks for squeezing the fingers, to which
may be added the bamboo; besides these no instruments of
torture are legally allowed, though other ways of putting the
question are so common as to give the impression that some of
them at least are sanctioned. Pulling or twisting the ears with
roughened fingers, and keeping them in a bent position while
making the prisoner kneel on chains, or making him kneel for
a long time, are among the illegal modes. Striking the lips
with sticks until they are nearly jellied, putting the hands in
stocks before or behind the back, wrapping the fingers in oiled
cloth to burn them, suspending the body by the thumbs and
fingers, tying the hands to a bar under the knees, so as to bend
the body double, and chaining by the neck close to a stone, are
resorted to when the prisoner is contumacious. One magistrate
is accused of having fastened up two criminals to boards by
nails driven through their palms; one of them tore his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
loose and was nailed up again, which caused his death; using
beds of iron, boiling water, red hot spikes, and cutting the
tendon Achilles are also charged against him, but the Emperor
exonerated him on account of the atrocious character of the
criminals. Compelling them to kneel upon pounded glass, sand,
and salt mixed together, until the knees become excoriated, or
simply kneeling upon chains is a lighter mode of the same infliction.
Mr. Milne mentions seeing a wretch undergoing this
torture, his hands tied behind his back to a stake held in its
position by two policemen; if he swerved to relieve the agony
of his position, a blow on his head compelled him to resume it.
The agonies of the poor creature were evident from his quivering
lips, his pallid and senseless countenance, and his tremulous
voice imploring relief, which was refused with a cold, mocking
command, “Suffer or confess.”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>Flogging is one of the five authorized punishments, but it is
used more than any other means to elicit confession; the bamboo,
rattan, cudgel, and whip are all employed. When death
ensues the magistrate reports that the criminal died of sickness,
or hushes it up by bribing his friends, few of whom are ever
allowed access within the walls of the prison to see and comfort
the sufferers. From the manner in which such a result is
spoken of it may be inferred that immediate death does not
often take place from torture. A magistrate in Sz’chuen being
abused by a man in court, who also struck the attendants,
ordered him to be put into a coffin which happened to be near,
when suffocation ensued; he was in consequence dismissed the
service, punished one hundred blows, and transported three
years. One check on outrageous torture is the fear that the
report of their cruelty will come to the ears of their superiors,
who are usually ready to avail of any mal-administration to get
an officer removed, in order to fill the post. In this case, as in
other parts of Chinese government, the dread of one evil prevents
the commission of another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIVE LEGAL PUNISHMENTS.</div>

<p>The five kinds of punishment mentioned in the code are
from ten to fifty blows with the lesser bamboo, from fifty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
one hundred with the greater, transportation, perpetual banishment,
and death, each of them modified in various ways.
The small bamboo weighs about two pounds, the larger two and
two-thirds pounds. Public exposure in the <i>kia</i>, or cangue, is
considered rather as a kind of censure or reprimand than a punishment,
and carries no disgrace with it, nor comparatively
much bodily suffering if the person be fed and screened from
the sun. The frame weighs between twenty and thirty pounds,
and is so made as to rest
upon the shoulders without
chafing the neck, but
so broad as to prevent
the person feeding himself.
The name, residence,
and offence of the
delinquent are written
upon it for the information
of every passer-by,
and a policeman is
stationed over him to
prevent escape. Branding
is applied to deserters
and banished persons.
Imprisonment and
fines are not regarded as
legal punishments, but
rather correctives; and
flogging, as Le Comte
says, “is never wanting, there being no condemnation in China
without this previous disposition, so that it is unnecessary to
mention it in their condemnation; this being always understood
to be their first dish.” When a man is arrested he is effectually
prevented from breaking loose by putting a chain around his
neck and tying his hands.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Mode of Exposure in the Cangue.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Most punishments are redeemable by the payment of money
if the criminal is under fifteen or over seventy years of age,
and a table is given in the code for the guidance of the magistrate
in such cases. An act of grace enables a criminal con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>demned
even to capital punishment to redeem himself, if the
offence be not one of wilful malignity; but better legislation
would have shown the good effects of not making the punishments
so severe. It is also ordered in Section XVIII., that “any
offender under sentence of death for a crime not excluded from
the contingent benefit of an act of grace, who shall have infirm
parents or grandparents alive over seventy years of age, and
no other male child over sixteen to support them, shall be
recommended to the mercy of his Majesty; and if only condemned
to banishment, shall receive one hundred blows and
redeem himself by a fine.” Many atrocious laws may be forgiven
for one such exhibition of regard for the care of decrepid
parents. Few governments exhibit such opposing principles of
actions as the Chinese: a strange blending of cruelty to prisoners
with a maudlin consideration of their condition, and a constant
effort to coax the people to obedience while exercising
great severity upon individuals, are everywhere manifest. One
who has lived in the country long, however, knows well that
they are not to be held in check by rope-yarn laws or whimpering
justices, and unless the rulers are a terror to evil-doers, the
latter will soon get the upper hand. Dr. Field well considers
this point in his interesting notes describing his visit to a
<i>yamun</i> at Canton.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> The general prosperity of the Empire
proves in some measure the equity of its administration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CORRECTION OF MINOR OFFENCES.</div>

<p>Banishment and slavery are punishments for minor official
delinquencies, and few officers who live long in the Emperor’s
employ do not take an involuntary journey to Mongolia, Turkestan,
or elsewhere, in the course of their lives. The fates
and conduct of banished criminals are widely unlike; some
doggedly serve out their time, others try to ingratiate themselves
with their masters in order to alleviate or shorten the
time of service, while hundreds contrive to escape and return
to their homes, though this subjects them to increased punishment.
Persons banished for treason are severely dealt with if
they return without leave, and those convicted of crime in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
place of banishment are increasingly punished; one man was
sentenced to be outlawed for an offence at his place of banishment,
but seeing that his aged mother had no other support
than his labor, the Emperor ordered that a small sum should
be paid for her living out of the public treasury. Whipping a
man through the streets as a public example to others is frequently
practised upon persons detected in robbery, assault, or
some other minor offences. The man is manacled, and one
policeman goes before him carrying a tablet, on which are
written his name, crime, and punishment, accompanied by another
holding a gong. In some cases little sticks bearing flags
are thrust through his ears, and the lictor appointed to oversee
the fulfilment of the sentence follows the executioner, who
strikes the criminal with his whip or rattan as the rap on the
gong denotes that the appointed number is not yet complete.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANNER OF PUBLIC EXECUTIONS.</div>

<p>Decapitation and strangling are the legal modes of executing
criminals, though Kí Kung having taken several incendiaries at
Canton, in 1843, who were convicted of firing the city for purposes
of plunder, starved them to death in the public squares of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
the city. The least disgraceful mode of execution is strangulation,
which is performed by tying a man to a post and tightening the
cord which goes round his neck by a winch; the infliction is
very speedy, and apparently less painful than hanging. The
least crime for which death is awarded appears to be a third and
aggravated theft, and defacing the branding inflicted for former
offences. Decollation is considered more disgraceful than strangling,
owing to the dislike the Chinese have of dissevering the
bodies which their parents gave them entire. There are two
modes of decapitation, that of simple decollation being considered,
again, as less disgraceful than being “cut into ten thousand
pieces,” as the phrase <i>ling chih</i> has been rendered. The military
officer who superintends the execution is attended by a
guard, to keep the populace from crowding upon the limits and
prevent resistance on the part of the prisoners. The bodies are
given up to the friends, except when the head is exposed as a
warning in a cage where the crime was committed. If no one
is present to claim the corpse it is buried in the public pit. The
criminals are generally so far exhausted that they make no resistance,
and submit to their fate without a groan&mdash;much more,
without a dying speech to the spectators. In ordinary cases
the executions are postponed until the autumnal assize, when
the Emperor revises and confirms the sentences of the provincial
governors; criminals guilty of extraordinary offences, as robbery
attended with murder, arson, rape, breaking into fortifications,
highway robbery, and piracy, may be immediately beheaded
without reference to court, and as the expense of maintenance
and want of prison room are both to be considered, it is the
fact that criminals condemned for one or other of these crimes
comprise the greater part of the unreferred executions in the
provinces.</p>

<p>It is impossible to ascertain the number of persons executed
in China, for the life of a condemned criminal is thought little
of; in the court circular it is merely reported that “the execution
of the criminals was completed,” without mentioning their
crimes, residences, or names. At the autumnal revises at Peking
the number sentenced is given in the <cite>Gazette</cite>; 935 were
sentenced in 1817, of which 133 were from the province of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
Kwangtung; in 1826 there were 581; in 1828 the number
was 789, and in the next year 579 names were marked off, none of
whose crimes, it is inferrible, are included in the list of offences
mentioned above. The condemnations are sent from the capital
by express, and the executions take place immediately. Most
of the persons condemned in a province are executed in its capital,
and to hear of the death of a score or more of felons on a
single day is no uncommon thing. The trials are more speedy
than comports with our notions of justice, and the executions are
performed in the most summary manner. It is reported on one
occasion that the governor-general of Canton ascended his judgment-seat,
examined three prisoners brought before him, and
having found them guilty, condemned them, asked himself for
the death-warrant (for he temporarily filled the office of governor),
and, having received it, had the three men carried away
in about two hours after they were first brought before him. A
few days after he granted the warrant to execute a hundred
bandits in prison. During the terrible rebellion in Kwangtung,
in 1854-55, the prisoners taken by the Imperialists were usually
transported to Canton for execution. In a space of fourteen
months, up to January, 1856, about eighty-three thousand malefactors
suffered death in that city alone, besides those who died
in confinement; these men were arrested and delivered to execution
by their countrymen, who had suffered untold miseries
through their sedition and rapine.</p>

<p>When taken to execution the prisoners are clothed in clean
clothes.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> A military officer is present, and the criminals are
brought on the ground in hod-like baskets hanging from a pole
borne of two, or in cages, and are obliged to kneel toward the
Emperor’s residence, or toward the death-warrant, which indicates
his presence, as if thanking their sovereign for his care.
The list is read aloud and compared with the tickets on the
prisoners; as they kneel, a lictor seizes their pinioned hands
and jerks them upward so that the head is pushed down horizontally,
and a single down stroke with the heavy hanger severs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
it from the neck. In the slow and ignominious execution, or
<i>ling chih</i>, the criminal is tied to a cross and hacked to pieces; the
executioner is nevertheless often hired to give the coup-de-grace
at the first blow. It is not uncommon for him to cut out the
gall-bladder of notorious robbers and sell it, to be eaten as a
specific for courage. There is an official executioner besides the
real one, the latter being sometimes a criminal taken out of the
prisons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ATROCIOUS MANAGEMENT OF PRISONS.</div>

<p>Probably the number of persons who suffer by the sword of
the executioner is not one-half of those who die from the effects
of torture and privations in prisons. Not much is known of
the internal arrangement of the <i>hells</i>, as prisons are called; they
seem to be managed with a degree of kindness and attention to
the comfort of the prisoners, so far as the intentions of government
are concerned, but the cruelties of the turnkeys and older
prisoners to exact money from the new comers are terrible. In
Canton there are jails in the city under the control of four different
officers, the largest covering about an acre, and capable
of holding upward of five hundred prisoners. Since it is the
practice of distant magistrates to send their worst prisoners up
to the capital, these jails are not large enough, and jail distempers
arise from over-crowding; two hundred deaths were
reported in 1826 from this and other causes, and one hundred
and seventeen cases in 1831. Private jails were hired to accommodate
the number, and one governor reports having found
twenty-two such places in Canton where every kind of cruelty
was practised. The witnesses and accusers concerned in appellate
causes had, he says, also been brought up to the city and
imprisoned along with the guilty party, where they were kept
months without any just reason. In one case, where a defendant
and plaintiff were imprisoned together, the accuser fell upon
the other and murdered him. Sometimes the officer is unable
from press of business to attend to a case, and confines all the
principals and witnesses concerned until he can examine them,
but the government takes no means to provide for them during
the interval, and many of the poorer ones die. No security or
bail is obtainable on the word of a witness or his friends, so
that if unable to fee the jailers he is in nearly as bad a case as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
criminal. Extending bail to an accused criminal is nearly unknown,
but female prisoners are put in charge of their husbands
or parents, who are held responsible for their appearance. The
constant succession of criminals in the provincial head prison
renders the posts of jailers and turnkeys very lucrative. The
letters of the Roman Catholic missionaries from China during
the last century, found in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres Édifiantes</cite> and <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de
la Foi</cite>, contain many sad pictures of the miseries of prison life
there.</p>

<p>The prisons are arranged somewhat on the plan of a large
stable, having an open central court occupying nearly one-fourth
of the area, and small cribs or stalls covered by a roof extending
nearly around it, so contrived that each company of prisoners
shall be separated from its neighbors on either side night and
day, though more by night than by day. The prisoners cook for
themselves in the court, and are secured by manacles and gyves,
and a chain joining the hands to the neck; one hand is liberated
in the daytime in order to allow them to take care of themselves.
Heinous criminals are more heavily ironed, and those in the
prisons attached to the judge’s office are worse treated than the
others. Each criminal should receive a daily ration of two
pounds of rice, and about two cents with which to buy fuel, but
the jailer starves them on half this allowance if they are unable
to fee him; clothing is also scantily provided, but those who
have money can procure almost every convenience. Each crib
full of criminals is under the control of a turnkey, who with a
few old offenders spends much time torturing newly arrived
persons to force money from them, by which many lose their
lives, and all suffer far more in this manner than they do from
the officers of government. Well may the people call their
prisons hells, and say, when a man falls into the clutches of the
jailers or police, “the flesh is under the cleaver.”</p>

<p>There are many processes for the recovery of debts and fulfilment
of contracts, some legal and others customary, the latter
depending upon many circumstances irrelevant to the merits of
the case. The law allows that debtors be punished by bambooing
according to the amount of the debt. A creditor often
resorts to illegal means to recover his claim, which give rise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
many excesses; sometimes he quarters himself upon the debtor’s
family or premises, at others seizes him or some of his family
and keeps them prisoners, and, in extreme cases, sells them.
Unscrupulous debtors are equally skilful and violent in eluding,
cheating, and resisting their incensed creditors, according as
they have the power. They are liable, when three months
have expired after the stipulated time of payment, to be bambooed,
and their property attached. In most cases, however,
disputes of this sort are settled without recourse to government,
and if the debtor is really without property, he is not imprisoned
till he can procure it. The effects of absconding debtors
are seized and divided by those who can get them. Long experience,
moreover, of each other’s characters has taught them,
in contracting debts, to have some security at the outset, and
therefore in settling up there is not so much loss as might be
supposed considering the difficulty of collecting debts. Accusations
for libel, slander, breach of marriage contract, and other
civil or less criminal offences are not all brought before the
authorities, but are settled by force or arbitration among the
people themselves and their elders.</p>

<p>The nominal salaries of Chinese officers have already been
stated (p. <a href="#Page_294">294</a>). It is a common opinion among the people that
on an average they receive about ten times their salaries; in
some cases they pay thirty, forty and more thousand dollars
beforehand for the situation. One encouragement to the
harassing vexations of the official secretaries and police is the
dislike of the people to carry their cases before officers who
they know are almost compelled to fleece and peel them; they
think it cheaper and safer to bear a small exaction from an
underling than run the risk of a greater from his master.</p>

<p>If the preventives against popular violence which the supreme
government has placed around itself could be strengthened
by an efficient military force, its power would be well
secured indeed; but then, as in Russia, it would probably become,
by degrees, an intolerable tyranny. The troops are, in
fact, everywhere present, ostensibly to support the laws, protect
the innocent, and punish the guilty; such of them as are employed
by the authorities as guards and policemen are, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
whole, efficient and courteous, though miserably paid, while the
regiments in garrison are contemptible to both friend and foe.</p>

<p>The efficacy of the system of checks upon the high courts and
provincial officers is increased by their intrigues and conflicting
ambition, and long experience has shown that the Emperor’s
power has little to fear from proconsular rebellion. The inefficiency
of the army is a serious evil to the people in one respect,
for more power in that arm would repress banditti and pirates;
while the sober part of the community would coöperate in a
hearty effort to quell them. The greatest difficulty the Emperor
finds in upholding his authority lies in the general want
of integrity in the officers he employs; good laws may be made,
but he has few upright agents to execute them. This has been
abundantly manifested in the laws against opium and gambling;
no one could be found to carry them into execution, though
everybody assented to their propriety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LATENT INFLUENCE OF PUBLIC OPINION.</div>

<p>The chief security on the side of the people against an unmitigated
oppression such as now exists in Turkey, besides
those already pointed out, lies as much as anywhere in their
general intelligence of the true principles on which the government
is founded and should be executed. With public opinion
on its side the government is a strong one, but none is less able
to execute its designs when it runs counter to that opinion,
although those designs may be excellent and well intended.
Elements of discord are found in the social system which would
soon effect its ruin were they not counteracted by other influences,
and the body politic goes on like a heavy, shackly, lumbering
van, which every moment threatens a crashing, crumbling
fall, yet goes on still tottering, owing to the original goodness
of its construction. From the enormous population of this
ancient van, it is evident that any attempt to remodel it must
seriously affect one or the other of its parts, and that when
once upset it may be impossible to reconstruct it in its original
form. There is encouragement to hope that the general intelligence
and shrewdness of the government and people of China,
their language, institutions, industry, and love of peace, will all
act as powerful conservative influences in working out the
changes which cannot now be long delayed; and that she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
maintain her unity and industry while going through a thorough
reform of her political, social, and religious systems.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to convey to the reader a fair view of the
administration of the laws in China. Notwithstanding the
cruelty of officers to the criminals before them, they are not all
to be considered as tyrants; because insurrections arise, attended
with great loss of life, it must not be supposed that
society is everywhere disorganized; the Chinese are so prone
to falsify that it is difficult to ascertain the truth, yet it must
not be inferred that every sentence is a lie; selfishness is a
prime motive for their actions, yet charity, kindness, filial
affection, and the unbought courtesies of life still exist among
them. Although there is an appalling amount of evil and crime
in every shape, it is mixed with some redeeming traits; and in
China, as elsewhere, good and bad are intermingled. Some of
the evils in the social system arise from the operation of the
principles of mutual responsibility, while this very feature produces
sundry good effects in restraining people who have no
higher motive than the fear of injuring the innocent. We hear
so much of the shocking cruelties of courts and prisons that
the vast number of cases before the bench are all supposed to
exhibit the same fatiguing reiteration of suffering, injustice,
bribery, and cruelty. One must live in the country to see how
the antagonistic principles found in Chinese society act and react
upon each other, and are affected by the wicked passions of
the heart. Officers and people are bad almost beyond belief to
one conversant only with the courtesy, justice, purity, and sincerity
of Christian governments and society; and yet we think
they are not as bad as the old Greeks and Romans, and have no
more injustice or torture in their courts, nor impurity or mendacity
in their lives. As in our own land we are apt to forget
that the recitals of crimes and outrages which the daily papers
bring before our eyes furnish no index of the general condition
of society, so in China, where that condition is immeasurably
worse, we must be mindful that this is likewise true.</p>

<span class="smaller">EDUCATION AND LITERARY EXAMINATIONS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Among the points relating to the Chinese people which have
attracted the attention of students in the history of intellectual
development, their long duration and literary institutions have
probably taken precedence. To estimate the causes of the first
requires much knowledge of the second, and from them one is
gradually led onward to an examination of the government,
religion, and social life of this people in the succeeding epochs
of their existence. The inquiry will reveal much that is instructive,
and show us that, if they have not equalled many
other nations in the arts and adornments of life, they have attained
a high degree of comfort and developed much that is
creditable in education, the science of rule, and security of life
and property.</p>

<p>Although the powers of mind exhibited by the greatest
writers in China are confessedly inferior to those of Greece
and Rome for genius and original conceptions, the good influence
exerted by them over their countrymen is far greater, even
at this day, than was ever obtained by western sages, as Plato,
Aristotle, or Seneca. The thoroughness of Chinese education,
the purity and effectiveness of the examinations, or the accuracy
and excellency of the literature must not be compared with
those of modern Christian countries, for there is really no common
measure between the two; they must be taken with other
parts of Chinese character, and comparisons drawn, if necessary,
with nations possessing similar opportunities. The importance
of generally instructing the people was acknowledged even before
the time of Confucius, and practised to a good degree at an age
when other nations in the world had no such system; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
although in his day feudal institutions prevailed, and offices
and rank were not attainable in the same manner as at present,
on the other hand magistrates and noblemen deemed it necessary
to be well acquainted with their ancient writings. It is
said in the <cite>Book of Rites</cite> (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1200), “that for the purposes of
education among the ancients, villages had their schools, districts
their academies, departments their colleges, and principalities
their universities.” This, so far as we know, was altogether
superior to what obtained among the Jews, Persians,
and Syrians of the same period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STIMULUS TO LITERARY PURSUITS.</div>

<p>The great stimulus to literary pursuits is the hope thereby of
obtaining office and honor, and the only course of education
followed is the classical and historical one prescribed by law.
Owing to this undue attention to the classics, the minds of the
scholars are not symmetrically trained, and they disparage other
branches of literature which do not directly advance this great
end. Every department of letters, except jurisprudence, history,
and official statistics, is disesteemed in comparison; and
the literary graduate of fourscore will be found deficient in
most branches of general learning, ignorant of hundreds of
common things and events in his national history, which the
merest schoolboy in the western world would be ashamed not
to know in his. This course of instruction does not form well-balanced
minds, but it imbues the future rulers of the land
with a full understanding of the principles on which they are
to govern, and the policy of the supreme power in using those
principles to consolidate its own authority.</p>

<p>Centralization and conservatism were the leading features of
the teachings of Confucius which first recommended them to
the rulers, and have decided the course of public examinations
in selecting officers who would readily uphold these principles.
The effect has been that the literary class in China holds the
functions of both nobles and priests, a perpetual association,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gens æterna in qua memo nascitur</i>, holding in its hands public
opinion and legal power to maintain it. The geographical
isolation of the people, the nature of the language, and the
absence of a landed aristocracy, combine to add efficiency to
this system; and when the peculiarities of Chinese character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
and the nature of the class-books which do so much to mould
that character, are considered, it is impossible to devise a better
plan for insuring the perpetuity of the government, or the contentment
of the people under that government.</p>

<p>It was about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 600, that Taitsung, of the Tang dynasty,
instituted the present plan of preparing and selecting civilians
by means of study and degrees, founding his system on the
facts that education had always been esteemed, and that the
ancient writings were accepted by all as the best instructors of
the manners and tastes of the people. According to native
historians, the rulers of ancient times made ample provision for
the cultivation of literature and promotion of education in all
its branches. They supply some details to enable us to understand
the mode and the materials of this instruction, and glorify
it as they do everything ancient, but probably from the want
of authentic accounts in their own hands, they do not clearly
describe it. The essays of M. Édouard Biot on the <cite>History of
Public Instruction in China</cite>, contains well-nigh all the information
extant on this interesting subject, digested in a very lucid
manner. Education is probably as good now as it ever was,
and its ability to maintain and develop the character of the
people as great as at any time; it is remarkable how much it
really has done to form, elevate, and consolidate their national
institutions. The Manchu monarchs were not at first favorably
disposed to the system of examinations, and frowned upon the
literary hierarchy who claimed all honors as their right; but
the next generation saw the advantages and necessity of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concours</i>, in preserving its own power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">METHODS AND PURPOSE OF EDUCATION IN CHINA.</div>

<p>Boys commence their studies at the age of seven with a
teacher; for, even if the father be a literary man he seldom instructs
his sons, and very few mothers are able to teach their
offspring to read. Maternal training is supposed to consist in
giving a right direction to the morals, and enforcing the obedience
of the child; but as there are few mothers who do more
than compel obedience by commands, or by the rod, so there are
none who can teach the infantile mind to look up to its God in
prayer and praise.</p>

<p>Among the many treatises for the guidance of teachers, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
<cite>Siao Hioh</cite>, or ‘Juvenile Instructor,’ is regarded as most authoritative.
When establishing the elements of education, this book
advises fathers to “choose from among their concubines those
who are fit for nurses, seeking such as are mild, indulgent, affectionate,
benevolent, cheerful, kind, dignified, respectful, and
reserved and careful in their conversation, whom they will make
governesses over their children. When able to talk, lads must
be instructed to answer in a quick, bold tone, and girls in a slow
and gentle one. At the age of seven, they should be taught to
count and name the cardinal points; but at this age the sexes
should not be allowed to sit on the same mat nor eat from the
same table. At eight, they must be taught to wait for their superiors,
and prefer others to themselves. At ten, the boys
must be sent abroad to private tutors, and there remain day and
night, studying writing and arithmetic, wearing plain apparel,
learning to demean themselves in a manner becoming their age,
and acting with sincerity of purpose. At thirteen, they must
attend to music and poetry; at fifteen, they must practise archery
and charioteering. At the age of twenty, they are in due
form to be admitted to the rank of manhood, and learn additional
rules of propriety, be faithful in the performance of filial
and fraternal duties, and though they possess extensive knowledge,
must not affect to teach others. At thirty, they may
marry and commence the management of business. At forty,
they may enter the service of the state; and if their prince
maintains the reign of reason, they must serve him, but otherwise
not. At fifty, they may be promoted to the rank of ministers;
and at seventy, they must retire from public life.”</p>

<p>Another injunction is, “Let children always be taught to
speak the simple truth; to stand erect and in their proper places,
and listen with respectful attention.” The way to become a
student, “is, with gentleness and self-abasement, to receive implicitly
every word the master utters. The pupil, when he sees
virtuous people, must follow them, when he hears good maxims,
conform to them. He must cherish no wicked designs, but always
act uprightly; whether at home or abroad, he must have
a fixed residence, and associate with the benevolent, carefully
regulating his personal deportment, and controlling the feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
of his heart. He must keep his clothes in order. Every morning
he must learn something new, and rehearse the same every
evening.” The great end of education, therefore, among the
ancient Chinese, was not so much to fill the head with knowledge,
as to discipline the heart and purify the affections. One
of their writers says, “Those who respect the virtuous and put
away unlawful pleasures, serve their parents and prince to the
utmost of their ability, and are faithful to their word; these,
though they should be considered unlearned, we must pronounce
to be educated men.” Although such terms as purity, filial
affection, learning, and truth, have higher meanings in a Christian
education than are given them by Chinese masters, the inculcation
of them in any degree and so decided a manner does
great credit to the people, and will never need to be superseded&mdash;only
raised to a higher grade.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>In intercourse with their relatives, children are taught to attend
to the minutest points of good breeding; and are instructed in
everything relating to their personal appearance, making their
toilet, saluting their parents, eating, visiting, and other acts of
life. Many of these directions are trivial even to puerility, but
they are none too minute in the ideas of the Chinese, and still
form the basis of good manners, as much as they did a score of
centuries ago; and it can hardly be supposed that Confucius
would have risked his influence upon the grave publication of
trifles, if he had not been well acquainted with the character of
his countrymen. Yet nothing is trifling which conduces to the
growth of good manners among a people, though it may not
have done all that was wished.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>Rules are laid down for students to observe in the prosecution
of their studies, which reflect credit on those who set so
high a standard for themselves. Dr. Morrison has given a
synopsis of a treatise of this sort, called the ‘Complete Collection
of Family Jewels,’ and containing a minute specification of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
duties to be performed by all who would be thorough students.
The author directs the tyro to form a fixed resolution to press
forward in his studies, setting his mark as high as possible, and
thoroughly understanding everything as he goes along. “I
have always seen that a man who covets much and devotes
himself to universal knowledge, when he reads he presumes on
the quickness and celerity of his genius and perceptions, and
chapters and volumes pass before his eyes, and issue from his
mouth as fluently as water rolls away; but when does he ever
apply his mind to rub and educe the essence of a subject? In
this manner, although much be read, what is the use of it?
Better little and fine, than much and coarse.” He also advises
persons to have two or three good volumes lying on their tables,
which they can take up at odd moments, and to keep commonplace
books in which they can jot down such things as occur to
them. They should get rid of distracting thoughts if they
wish to advance in their studies; as “if a man’s stomach has
been filled by eating greens and other vegetables, although the
most precious dainties with exquisite tastes should be given
him, he cannot swallow them, he must first get rid of a few
portions of the greens; so in reading, the same is true of the
mixed thoughts which distract the mind, which are about the
dusty affairs of a vulgar world.” The rules given by these
writers correspond to those laid down among ourselves, in such
books as Todd’s <cite>Manual for Students</cite>, and reveal the steps
which have given the Chinese their intellectual position.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRANGEMENT AND RÉGIME OF BOYS’ SCHOOLS.</div>

<p>For all grades of scholars, there is but one mode of study;
the imitative nature of the Chinese mind is strikingly exhibited
in the few attempts on the part of teachers to improve upon
the stereotyped practice of their predecessors, although persons
of as original minds as the country affords are constantly engaged
in education. When the lad commences his studies, an
impressive ceremony takes place&mdash;or did formerly, for it seems
to have fallen into desuetude: the father leads his son to the
teacher, who kneels down before the name of some one or other
of the ancient sages, and supplicates their blessing upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
pupil; after which, seating himself, he receives the homage
and petition of the lad to guide him in his lessons.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> As is the
case in Moslem countries, a present is expected to accompany
this initiation into literary pursuits. In all cases this event is
further marked by giving the lad his <i>shu ming</i> or ‘book name,’
by which he is called during his future life. The furniture of
the school merely consists of a desk and a stool for each pupil,
and an elevated seat for the master, for maps, globes, black-boards,
diagrams, etc., are yet to come in among its articles of
furniture. In one corner is placed a tablet or an inscription on
the wall, dedicated to Confucius and the god of Letters; the
sage is styled the ‘Teacher and Pattern for All Ages,’ and incense
is constantly burned in honor of them both.</p>

<p>The location of school-rooms is usually such as would be considered
bad elsewhere, but by comparison with other things in
China, is not so. A mat shed which barely protects from the
weather, a low, hot upper attic of a shop, a back room in a
temple, or rarely a house specially built for the purpose, such
are the school-houses in China. The chamber is hired by the
master, who regulates his expenses and furnishes his apartment
according to the number and condition of his pupils; their
average number is about twenty, ranging between ten and forty
in day schools, and in private schools seldom exceeding ten.
The most thorough course of education is probably pursued in
the latter, where a well-qualified teacher is hired by four or five
persons living in the same street, or mutually related by birth
or marriage, to teach their children at a stipulated salary. In
such cases the lads are placed in bright, well-aired apartments,
superior to the common school-room. The majority of teachers
have been unsuccessful candidates for literary degrees, who
having spent the prime of their days in fruitless attempts to
attain office, are unfit for manual labor, and unable to enter on
mercantile life. In Canton, a teacher of twenty boys receives
from half a dollar to a dollar per month from each pupil; in
country villages, three, four or five dollars a year are given,
with the addition, in most cases, of a small present of eatables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
from each scholar three or four times a year. Private tutors
receive from $150 to $350 or more per annum, according to
particular engagement. There are no boarding-schools, nor
anything answering to infant schools; nor are public or charity
schools established by government, or by private benevolence
for the education of the poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION.</div>

<p>The first hours of study are from sunrise till ten <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, when
the boys go to breakfast; they reassemble in an hour or more,
and continue at their books till about five <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, when they disperse
for the day. In summer, they have no lessons after dinner,
but an evening session is often held in the winter, and evening
schools are occasionally opened for mechanics and others
who are occupied during the day. When a boy comes into
school in the morning, he bows reverentially before the tablet
of Confucius, salutes his teacher, and then takes his seat. The
vacations during the year are few; the longest is before new
year, at which time the engagement is completed, and the school
closes, to be reöpened after the teacher and parents have made a
new arrangement. The common festivals, of which there are a
dozen or more, are regarded as holydays, and form very necessary
relaxations in a country destitute of the rest of the Sabbath.
The requisite qualifications of a teacher are gravity, severity,
and patience, and acquaintance with the classics; he has
only to teach the same series of books in the same fashion in
which he learned them himself and keep a good watch over his
charge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TRIMETRICAL CLASSIC.</div>

<p>When the lads come together at the opening of the school,
their attainments are ascertained; the teacher endeavors to
have his pupils nearly equal in this respect, but inasmuch as
they are all put to precisely the same tasks, a difference is not
material. If the boys are beginners, they are brought up in a
line before the desk, holding the <cite>San-tsz’ King</cite>, or ‘Trimetrical
Classic,’ in their hands, and taught to read off the first lines
after the teacher until they can repeat them without help. He
calls off the first four lines as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse"><i>Jin chí tsu, sing pun shen;</i></div>
      <div class="verse"><i>Sing siang kin, sih siang yuen;</i></div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>
<p>when his pupils simultaneously cry out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse"><i>Jin chí tsu, sing pun shen;</i></div>
      <div class="verse"><i>Sing siang kin, sih siang yuen.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mispronunciations are corrected until each can read the lesson
accurately; they are then sent to their seats to commit the
sounds to memory. As the sounds are all entire words (not
letters, nor syllables, of which they have no idea), the boys are
not perplexed, as ours are, with symbols which have no meaning.
All the children study aloud, and when one is able to recite
the task, he is required to <em>back</em> it&mdash;come up to the master’s
desk, and stand with his back toward him while rehearsing it.</p>

<p>The <cite>San-tsz’ King</cite> was compiled by Wang Pih-hao of the
Sung dynasty (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1050) for his private school. It contains
ten hundred and sixty-eight words, and half that number of different
characters, arranged in one hundred and seventy-eight
double lines. It has been commented upon by several persons,
one of whom calls it “a ford which the youthful inquirer may
readily pass, and thereby reach the fountain-head of the higher
courses of learning, or a passport into the regions of classical and
historical literature.” This hornbook begins with the nature of
man, and the necessity and modes of education, and it is noticeable
that the first sentence, the one quoted above, which a Chinese
learns at school, contains one of the most disputed doctrines in
the ancient heathen world:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“Men at their birth, are by nature radically good;</div>
      <div class="verse">Though alike in this, in practice they widely diverge.</div>
      <div class="verse">If not educated, the natural character grows worse;</div>
      <div class="verse">A course of education is made valuable by close attention.</div>
      <div class="verse">Of old, Mencius’ mother selected a residence,</div>
      <div class="verse">And when her son did not learn, cut out the [half-wove] web.</div>
      <div class="verse">To nurture and not educate is a father’s error;</div>
      <div class="verse">To educate without rigor shows a teacher’s indolence.</div>
      <div class="verse">That boys should not learn is an unjust thing;</div>
      <div class="verse">For if they do not learn in youth, what will they do when old?</div>
      <div class="verse">As gems unwrought serve no useful end,</div>
      <div class="verse">So men untaught will never know what right conduct is.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The importance of filial and fraternal duties are then inculcated
by precept and example, to which succeeds a synopsis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
the various branches of learning in an ascending series, under
several heads of numbers; the three great powers, the four
seasons and four cardinal points, the five elements and five constant
virtues, the six kinds of grain and six domestic animals,
the seven passions, the eight materials for music, nine degrees of
kindred, and ten social duties. A few extracts will exhibit the
mode in which these subjects are treated.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>To this technical summary succeed rules for a course of
academical studies, with a list of the books to be learned, and
the order of their use, followed by a synopsis of the general history
of China, in an enumeration of the successive dynasties.
The work concludes with incidents and motives to learning
drawn from the conduct of ancient sages and statesmen, and
from considerations of interest and glory. The examples cited
are curious instances of pursuit of knowledge under difficulties,
and form an inviting part of the treatise.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>These quotations illustrate the character of the <cite>Trimetrical
Classic</cite>, and show its imperfections as a book for young
minds. It is a syllabus of studies rather than a book to be
learned, and ill suited to entice the boy on in his tasks by giving
him mental food in an attractive form. Yet its influence has
been perhaps as great as the classics during the last four dynasties,
from its general use in primary schools, where myriads of
lads have “backed” it who have had no leisure to study much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
more, and when they had crossed this ford could travel no
farther. The boy commences his education by learning these
maxims; and by the time he has got his degree&mdash;and long before,
too&mdash;the highest truths and examples known in the land
are more deeply impressed on his mind than are ever Biblical
truths and examples on graduates of Yale, Oxford, Heidelberg
or the Sorbonne. Well was it for them that they had learned
nothing in it which they had better forget, for its deficiencies,
pointed out by Bridgman in his translation, should not lead us
to overlook its suggestive synopsis of principles and examples.
The commentary explains them very fully, and it is often
learned as thoroughly as the text. Many thousands of tracts
containing Christian truths written in the same style and with
the same title, have been taught with good effect in the mission
schools in China.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>The next hornbook put into the boy’s hands is the <cite>Pih Kia
Sing</cite>, or ‘Century of Surnames.’ It is a list of the family or clan
names commonly in use. Its acquisition also gives him familiarity
with four hundred and fifty-four common words employed
as names, a knowledge, too, of great importance lest mistakes
be made in choosing a wrong character among the scores of
homophonous characters in the language. For instance, out of
eighty-three common words pronounced <i>kí</i>, six only are clan
names, and it is necessary to have these very familiar in the
daily intercourse of life. The nature of the work forbids its being
studied, but the usefulness of its contents probably explains
its position in this series.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE THOUSAND-CHARACTER CLASSIC.</div>

<p>The third in the list is the <cite>Tsien Tsz’ Wăn</cite>, or ‘Millenary
Classic,’ unique among all books in the Chinese language, and
whose like could not be produced in any other, in that it consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
of just a thousand characters, no two of which are alike in form or
meaning. The author, Chau Hing-tsz’, flourished about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 550,
and according to an account given in the history of the Liang
dynasty, wrote it at the Emperor’s request, who had ordered his
minister Wang Hí-chí to write out a thousand characters, and
give them to him, to see if he could make a connected ode with
them. This he did, and presented his performance to his majesty,
who rewarded him with rich presents in token of his approval.
Some accounts (in order that so singular a work might
not want for corresponding wonders) add that he did the task in
a single night, under the fear of condign punishment if he
failed, and the mental exertion was so great as to turn his hair
white. It consists of two hundred and fifty lines, in which
rhyme and rhythm are both carefully observed, though there
is no more poetry in it than in a multiplication table. The
contents of the book are similar but more discursive than those
of the <cite>Trimetrical Classic</cite>. Up to the one hundred and second
line, the productions of nature and virtues of the early monarchs,
the power and capacities of man, his social duties and
mode of conduct, with instructions as to the manner of living,
are summarily treated. Thence to the one hundred and sixty-second
line, the splendor of the palace, and its high dignitaries,
with other illustrious persons and places, are referred to. The
last part of the work treats of private and literary life, the pursuits
of agriculture, household government, and education, interspersed
with some exhortations, and a few illustrations. A few
disconnected extracts from Dr. Bridgman’s translation<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> will show
the mode in which these subjects are handled. The opening
lines are,</p>

      <div class="verse">The whole universe [at the creation] was one wide waste;”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>after which it takes a survey of the world and its products, and
Chinese history, in a very sententious manner, down to the
thirty-seventh line, which opens a new subject.</p>

<p>The commentary on the <cite>Thousand Character Classic</cite> contains
many just observations and curious anecdotes to explain
this book, whose text is so familiar to the people at large that its
lines or characters are used as labels instead of figures, as they
take up less room. If Western scholars were as familiar with
the acts and sayings of King Wăn, of Su Tsin, or of Kwan
Chung, as they are with those of Sesostris, Pericles, or Horace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
these incidents and places would naturally enough be deemed
more interesting than they now are. But where the power of
genius, or the vivid pictures of a brilliant imagination, are
wanting to illustrate or beautify a subject, there is comparatively
little to interest Europeans in the authors and statesmen of such
a distant country and remote period.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE STORY OF CONFUCIUS AND HIANG TOH.</div>

<p>The examples of intelligent youth rising to the highest offices
of state are numerous in all the works designed for beginners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
and stories illustrative of their precocity are sometimes given
in toy-books and novels. One of the most common instances is
here quoted, that of Confucius and Hiang Toh, which is as well
known to every Chinese as is the story of George Washington
barking the cherry-tree with his hatchet to American youth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The name of Confucius was Yu, and his style Chungní; he established
himself as an instructor in the western part of the kingdom of Lu. One day,
followed by all his disciples, riding in a carriage, he went out to ramble, and
on the road, came across several children at their sports; among them was one
who did not join in them. Confucius, stopping his carriage, asked him, saying,
‘Why is it that you alone do not play?’ The lad replied, ‘All play is without
any profit; one’s clothes get torn, and they are not easily mended; above
me, I disgrace my father and mother; below me, even to the lowest, there is
fighting and altercation; so much toil and no reward, how can it be a good
business? It is for these reasons that I do not play.’ Then dropping his head,
he began making a city out of pieces of tile.</p>

<p>“Confucius, reproving him, said, ‘Why do you not turn out for the carriage?’
The boy replied, ‘From ancient times till now it has always been
considered proper for a carriage to turn out for a city, and not for a city to
turn out for a carriage.’ Confucius then stopped his vehicle in order to discourse
of reason. He got out of the carriage, and asked him, ‘You are still
young in years, how is it that you are so quick?’ The boy replied, saying, ‘A
human being, at the age of three years, discriminates between his father and
his mother; a hare, three days after it is born, runs over the ground and furrows
of the fields; fish, three days after their birth, wander in rivers and
lakes; what heaven thus produces naturally, how can it be called brisk?’</p>

<p>“Confucius added, ‘In what village and neighborhood do you reside,
what is your surname and name, and what your style?’ The boy answered,
‘I live in a mean village and in an insignificant land; my surname is Hiang,
my name is Toh, and I have yet no style.’</p>

<p>“Confucius rejoined, ‘I wish to have you come and ramble with me; what do
you think of it?’ The youth replied, ‘A stern father is at home, whom I am
bound to serve; an affectionate mother is there, whom it is my duty to cherish;
a worthy elder brother is at home, whom it is proper for me to obey, with a tender
younger brother whom I must teach; and an intelligent teacher is there from
whom I am required to learn. How have I leisure to go a rambling with you?’</p>

<p>“Confucius said, ‘I have in my carriage thirty-two chessmen; what do
you say to having a game together?’ The lad answered, ‘If the Emperor love
gaming, the Empire will not be governed; if the nobles love play, the government
will be impeded; if scholars love it, learning and investigation will be lost
and thrown by; if the lower classes are fond of gambling, they will utterly
lose the support of their families; if servants and slaves love to game, they
will get a cudgelling; if farmers love it, they miss the time for ploughing and
sowing; for these reasons I shall not play with you.’</p>

<p>“Confucius rejoined, ‘I wish to have you go with me, and fully equalize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
the Empire; what do you think of this?’ The lad replied, ‘The Empire cannot
be equalized; here are high hills, there are lakes and rivers; either there
are princes and nobles, or there are slaves and servants. If the high hills be
levelled, the birds and beasts will have no resort; if the rivers and lakes be
filled up, the fishes and the turtles will have nowhere to go; do away with
kings and nobles, and the common people will have much dispute about right
and wrong; obliterate slaves and servants, and who will there be to serve the
prince! If the Empire be so vast and unsettled, how can it be equalized?’</p>

<p>“Confucius again asked, ‘Can you tell, under the whole sky, what fire has
no smoke, what water no fish; what hill has no stones, what tree no branches;
what man has no wife, what woman no husband; what cow has no calf, what
mare no colt; what cock has no hen, what hen no cock; what constitutes an
excellent man, and what an inferior man; what is that which has not enough,
and what which has an overplus; what city is without a market, and who is
the man without a style?’</p>

<p>“The boy replied, ‘A glowworm’s fire has no smoke, and well-water no
fish; a mound of earth has no stones, and a rotten tree no branches; genii
have no wives, and fairies no husbands; earthen cows have no calves, nor
wooden mares any colts; lonely cocks have no hens, and widowed hens no
cocks; he who is worthy is an excellent man, and a fool is an inferior man;
a winter’s day is not long enough, and a summer’s day is too long; the imperial
city has no market, and little folks have no style.’</p>

<p>“Confucius inquiring said, ‘Do you know what are the connecting bonds
between heaven and earth, and what is the beginning and ending of the dual
powers? What is left, and what is right; what is out, and what is in; who is
father, and who is mother; who is husband, and who is wife. [Do you know]
where the wind comes from, and from whence the rain? From whence the
clouds issue, and the dew arises? And for how many tens of thousands of
miles the sky and earth go parallel?’</p>

<p>“The youth answering said, ‘Nine multiplied nine times make eighty-one,
which is the controlling bond of heaven and earth; eight multiplied by nine
makes seventy-two, the beginning and end of the dual powers. Heaven is
father, and earth is mother; the sun is husband, and the moon is wife; east
is left, and west is right; without is out, and inside is in; the winds come
from Tsang-wu, and the rains proceed from wastes and wilds; the clouds issue
from the hills, and the dew rises from the ground. Sky and earth go parallel
for ten thousand times ten thousand miles, and the four points of the compass
have each their station.’</p>

<p>“Confucius asking, said, ‘Which do you say is the nearest relation, father
and mother, or husband and wife?’ The boy responded, ‘One’s parents are
near; husband and wife are not [so] near.’</p>

<p>“Confucius rejoined, ‘While husband and wive are alive, they sleep under
the same coverlet; when they are dead they lie in the same grave; how then
can you say that they are not near?’ The boy replied, ‘A man without a
wife is like a carriage without a wheel; if there be no wheel, another one is
made, for he can doubtless get a new one; so, if one’s wife die, he seeks
again, for he also can obtain a new one. The daughter of a worthy family
must certainly marry an honorable husband; a house having ten rooms always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
has a plate and a ridgepole; three windows and six lattices do not give the light
of a single door; the whole host of stars with all their sparkling brilliancy do
not equal the splendor of the solitary moon: the affection of a father and
mother&mdash;alas, if it be once lost!’</p>

<p>“Confucius sighing, said, ‘How clever! how worthy!’ The boy asking
the sage said, ‘You have just been giving me questions, which I have answered
one by one; I now wish to seek information; will the teacher in one sentence
afford me some plain instruction? I shall be much gratified if my request be
not rejected.’ He then said, ‘Why is it that mallards and ducks are able to
swim; how is it that wild geese and cranes sing; and why are firs and pines
green through the winter?’ Confucius replied, ‘Mallards and ducks can swim
because their feet are broad; wild geese and cranes can sing because they
have long necks; firs and pines remain green throughout the winter because
they have strong hearts.’ The youth rejoined, ‘Not so; fishes and turtles can
swim, is it because they all have broad feet? Frogs and toads can sing, is it
because their necks are long? The green bamboo keeps fresh in winter, is it
on account of its strong heart?’</p>

<p>“Again interrogating, he said, ‘How many stars are there altogether in the
sky?’ Confucius replied, ‘At this time inquire about the earth; how can we
converse about the sky with certainty?’ The boy said, ‘Then how many
houses in all are there on the earth?’ The sage answered, ‘Come now, speak
about something that’s before our eyes; why must you converse about heaven
and earth?’ The lad resumed, ‘Well, speak about what’s before our eyes&mdash;how
many hairs are there in your eyebrows?’</p>

<p>“Confucius smiled, but did not answer, and turning round to his disciples
called them and said, ‘This boy is to be feared; for it is easy to see that the
subsequent man will not be like the child.’ He then got into his carriage and
rode off.”<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE HIAO KING, OR CANONS OF FILIAL DUTY.</div>

<p>Next in course to this rather trifling primer comes the <cite>Hiao
King</cite>, or ‘Canons of Filial Duty,’ a short tractate of only 1,903
characters, which purports to be the record of a conversation
held between Confucius and his disciple Tsăng Tsan on the
principles of filial piety. Its authenticity has been disputed by
critics, but their doubts are not shared by their countrymen,
who commit it to memory as the words of the sage. The legend
is that a copy was discovered in the wall of his dwelling, and
compared with another secreted by Yen Chí at the burning of
the books; from the two Liu Hiang chose eighteen of the
chapters contained in it as alone genuine, and in this shape it
has since remained. The sixth section of the Imperial Catalogue
is entirely devoted to writers on the <cite>Hiao King</cite>, one of whom was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
Yuentsung, an emperor of the Tang dynasty (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 733). Another
comment was published in 32 volumes in Kanghí’s reign, discussing
the whole subject in one hundred chapters. Though it
does not share in critical eyes the confidence accorded to the
nine classics, the brevity and subject matter of this work have
commended it to teachers as one of the best books in the
language to be placed in the hands of their scholars; thus its
influence has been great and enduring. It has been translated
by Bridgman, who regards the first six sections as the words of
Confucius, while the other twelve contain his ideas. Two quotations
are all that need be here given to show its character.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Section I.</span>&mdash;<i>On the origin and nature of filial duty.</i>&mdash;Filial duty is the root
of virtue, and the stem from which instruction in the moral principle springs.
Sit down, and I will explain this to you. The first thing which filial duty requires
of us is, that we carefully preserve from all injury, and in a perfect
state, the bodies which we have received from our parents. And when we
acquire for ourselves a station in the world, we should regulate our conduct
by correct principles, so as to transmit our names to future generations, and
reflect glory on our parents. This is the ultimate aim of filial duty. Thus it
commences in attention to parents, is continued through a course of services
rendered to the prince, and is completed by the elevation of ourselves. It
is said in the <cite>Book of Odes</cite>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Ever think of your ancestors;</div>
      <div class="verse">Reproducing their virtue.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Section V.</span>&mdash;<i>On the attention of scholars to filial duty.</i>&mdash;With the same love
that they serve their fathers, they should serve their mothers; and with the
same respect that they serve their fathers, they should serve their prince; unmixed
love, then, will be the offering they make to their mothers; unfeigned
respect the tribute they bring to their prince; while toward their fathers both
these will be combined. Therefore they serve their prince with filial duty and
are faithful to him; they serve their superiors with respect and are obedient to
them. By constant obedience and faithfulness toward those who are above
them, they are enabled to preserve their stations and emoluments, and to offer
the sacrifices which are due to their deceased ancestors and parents. Such is
the influence of filial piety when performed by scholars. It is said in the
<cite>Book of Odes</cite>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">When the dawn is breaking, and I cannot sleep,</div>
      <div class="verse">The thoughts in my breast are of our parents.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></div>
</div></div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>
<p>The highest place in the list of virtues and obligations is accorded
to filial duty, not only in this, but in other writings of
Confucius and those of his school. “There are,” to quote from
another section, “three thousand crimes to which one or the
other of the five kinds of punishment is attached as a penalty;
and of these no one is greater than disobedience to parents.
When ministers exercise control over the monarch, then there
is no supremacy; when the maxims of the sages are set aside,
then the law is abrogated; and so those who disregard filial
duty are as though they had no parents. These three evils prepare
the way for universal rebellion.”</p>

<p>This social virtue has been highly lauded by all Chinese
writers, and its observance inculcated upon youth and children
by precept and example. Stories are written to show the good
effects of obedience, and the bad results of its contrary sin,
which are put into their hands, and form also subjects for pictorial
illustration, stanzas for poetry, and materials for conversation.
The following examples are taken from a toy-book of
this sort, called the <cite>Twenty-four Filials</cite>, one of the most popular
collections on the subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXTRACTS FROM THE TWENTY-FOUR FILIALS.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“During the Chau dynasty there lived a lad named Tsăng Tsan (also Tsz’-yu),
who served his mother very dutifully. Tsăng was in the habit of going to the
hills to collect fagots; and once, while he was thus absent, many guests came
to his house, toward whom his mother was at a loss how to act. She, while
expecting her son, who delayed his return, began to gnaw her fingers. Tsăng
suddenly felt a pain in his heart, and took up his bundle of fagots in order to
return home; and when he saw his mother, he kneeled and begged to know
what was the cause of her anxiety. She replied, ‘there have been some guests
here, who came from a great distance, and I bit my finger in order to arouse you
to return to me.’</p>

<p>“In the Chau dynasty lived Chung Yu, named also Tsz’-lu, who, because his
family was poor, usually ate herbs and coarse pulse; and he also went more
than a hundred <i>lí</i> to procure rice for his parents. Afterward, when they were
dead, he went south to the country of Tsu, where he was made commander of
a hundred companies of chariots; there he became rich, storing up grain in
myriads of measures, reclining upon cushions, and eating food served to him
in numerous dishes; but sighing, he said, ‘Although I should now desire to
eat coarse herbs and bring rice for my parents, it cannot be!’</p>

<p>“In the Chau dynasty there flourished the venerable Lai, who was very obedient
and reverential toward his parents, manifesting his dutifulness by exerting
himself to provide them with every delicacy. Although upward of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
seventy years of age, he declared that he was not yet old; and usually
dressed himself in parti-colored embroidered garments, and like a child
would playfully stand by the side of his parents. He would also take up
buckets of water, and try to carry them into the house; but feigning to slip,
would fall to the ground, wailing and crying like a child: and all these things
he did in order to divert his parents.</p>

<p>“During the Han dynasty lived Tung Yung, whose family was so very poor
that when his father died he was obliged to sell himself in order to procure
money to bury his remains. After this he went to another place to gain the
means of redeeming himself; and on his way he met a lady who desired to become
his wife, and go with him to his master’s residence. She went with him,
and wove three hundred pieces of silk, which being completed in two months,
they returned home; on the way, having reached the shade of the cassia tree
where they before met, the lady bowed and ascending, vanished from his sight.</p>

<p>“During the Han dynasty lived Ting Lan, whose parents both died when
he was young, before he could obey and support them; and he reflected that
for all the trouble and anxiety he had caused them, no recompense had yet
been given. He then carved wooden images of his parents, and served them
as if they had been alive. For a long time his wife would not reverence them;
but one day, taking a bodkin, she in derision pricked their fingers. Blood immediately
flowed from the wound; and seeing Ting coming, the images wept.
He examined into the circumstances, and forthwith divorced his wife.</p>

<p>“In the days of the Han dynasty lived Koh Kü, who was very poor. He
had one child three years old; and such was his poverty that his mother usually
divided her portion of food with this little one. Koh says to his wife,
‘We are so poor that our mother cannot be supported, for the child divides
with her the portion of food that belongs to her. Why not bury this child?
Another child may be born to us, but a mother once gone will never return.’
His wife did not venture to object to the proposal; and Koh immediately dug
a hole of about three cubits deep, when suddenly he lighted upon a pot of gold,
and on the metal read the following inscription: ‘Heaven bestows this treasure
upon Koh Kü, the dutiful son; the magistrate may not seize it, nor shall
the neighbors take it from him.’</p>

<p>“Măng Tsung, who lived in the Tsin dynasty, when young lost his father.
His mother was very sick; and one winter’s day she longed to taste a soup
made of bamboo sprouts, but Măng could not procure any. At last he went
into the grove of bamboos, clasped the trees with his hands, and wept bitterly.
His filial affection moved nature, and the ground slowly opened, sending forth
several shoots, which he gathered and carried home. He made a soup with
them, of which his mother ate and immediately recovered from her malady.</p>

<p>“Wu Măng, a lad eight years of age, who lived under the Tsin dynasty, was
very dutiful to his parents. They were so poor that they could not afford to
furnish their bed with mosquito-curtains; and every summer’s night, myriads
of mosquitos attacked them unrestrainedly, feasting upon their flesh and
blood. Although there were so many, yet Wu would not drive them away,
lest they should go to his parents, and annoy them. Such was his affection.”<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE SIAO HIOH, OR JUVENILE INSTRUCTOR.</div>

<p>The last book learned before entering on the classics has had
almost as great an influence as any of them, and none of the works
of later scholars are so well calculated to show the ideas of the
Chinese in all ages upon the principles of education, intercourse
of life, and rules of conduct as this; precepts are illustrated by
examples, and the examples referred back to precepts for their
moving cause. This is the <cite>Siao Hioh</cite>, or “Juvenile Instructor,”
and was intended by Chu Hí, its author, as a counterpart of the
<cite>Ta Hiao</cite>, on which he had written a commentary. It has had
more than fifty commentators, one of whom says, “We confide
in the <cite>Siao Hioh</cite> as we do in the gods, and revere it as we do
our parents.” It is divided into two books, the “fountain of
learning,” and “the stream flowing from it,” arranged in 20
chapters and 385 short sections. The first book has four parts
and treats of the first principles of education; of the duties we
owe our kindred, rulers, and fellow-men, of those we owe
ourselves in regard to study, demeanor, food, and dress; and
lastly gives numerous examples from ancient history, beginning
with very early times down to the end of the Chau dynasty,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 249, confirmatory of the maxims inculcated, and the good
effects resulting from their observance. The second book contains,
in its first part, a collection of wise sayings of eminent
men who flourished after <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 200, succeeded by a series of examples
of distinguished persons calculated to show the effects of
good principles; both designed to establish the truth of the
teachings of the first book. One or two quotations, themselves
extracted from other works, will suffice to show something of
its contents.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Confucius said, ‘Friends must sharply and frankly admonish each other,
and brothers must be gentle toward one another.’”</p>

<p>“Tsz’-kung, asking about friendship, Confucius said, ‘Faithfully to inform
and kindly to instruct another is the duty of a friend; if he is not tractable,
desist; do not disgrace yourself.’”</p>

<p>“Whoever enters with his guests, yields precedence to them at every door;
when they reach the innermost one, he begs leave to go in and arrange the
seats, and then returns to receive the guests; and after they have repeatedly
declined he bows to them and enters. He passes through the right door, they
through the left. He ascends the eastern, they the western steps. If a guest
be of a lower grade, he must approach the steps of the host, while the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
must repeatedly decline this attention; then the guest may return to the western
steps, he ascending, both host and guest must mutually yield precedence:
then the host must ascend first, and the guests follow. From step to step they
must bring their feet together, gradually ascending&mdash;those on the east moving
the right foot first, those on the west the left.”</p></div>

<p>The great influence which these six school-books have had is
owing to their formative power on youthful minds, a large proportion
of whom never go beyond them (either from want of
time, means, or desire), but are really here furnished with the
kernel of their best literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HABITS OF STUDY&mdash;SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES.</div>

<p>The tedium of memorizing these unmeaning sounds is relieved
by writing the characters on thin paper placed over copy slips.
The writing and the reading lessons are the same, and both are
continued for a year or two until the forms and sounds of a few
thousand characters are made familiar, but no particular effort
is taken to teach their meanings. It is after this that the teacher
goes over the same ground, and with the help of the commentary,
explains the meaning of the words and phrases one by
one, until they are all understood. It is not usual for the beginner
to attend much to the meaning of what he is learning to
read and write, and where the labor of committing arbitrary
characters is so great and irksome, experience has probably
shown that it is not wise to attempt too many things at once.
The boy has been familiarizing himself with their shapes as
he sees them all the time around him, and he learns what they
mean in a measure before he comes to school. The association
of form with ideas, as he cons his lesson and writes their words,
gradually strengthens, and results in that singular interdependence
of the eye and ear so observable among the scholars of the
far East. They trust to what is read to help in understanding what
is heard much more than is the case in phonetic languages. No
effort is made to facilitate the acquisition of the characters by the
boys in school by arranging them according to their component
parts; they are learned one by one, as boys are taught the names
and appearance of minerals in a cabinet. The effects of a course of
study like this, in which the powers of the tender mind are not
developed by proper nourishment of truthful knowledge, can
hardly be otherwise than to stunt the genius, and drill the fac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>ulties
of the mind into a slavish adherence to venerated usage
and dictation, making the intellects of Chinese students like the
trees which their gardeners so toilsomely dwarf into pots and
jars&mdash;plants, whose unnaturalness is congruous to the insipidity
of their fruit.</p>

<p>The number of years spent at school depends upon the means
of the parents. Tradesmen, mechanics, and country gentlemen
endeavor to give their sons a competent knowledge of the
usual series of books, so that they can creditably manage the
common affairs of life. No other branches of study are pursued
than the classics and histories, and what will illustrate
them, meanwhile giving much care and practice to composition.
No arithmetic or any department of mathematics, nothing
of the geography of their own or other countries, of natural
philosophy, natural history, or scientific arts, nor the study of
other languages, are attended to. Persons in these classes of
society put their sons into shops or counting-houses to learn the
routine of business with a knowledge of figures and the style
of letter-writing; they are not kept at school more than three
or four years, unless they mean to compete at the examinations.
Working men, desirous of giving their sons a smattering,
try to keep them at their books a year or two, but millions
must of course grow up in utter ignorance. It is, however,
an excellent policy for a state to keep up this universal honor
paid to education where the labor is so great and the return
so doubtful, for it is really the homage paid to the principles
taught.</p>

<p>Besides the common schools, there are grammar or high
schools and colleges, but they are far less effective. In Canton,
there are fourteen grammar schools and thirty colleges, some of
which are quite ancient, but most of them are neglected. Three
of the largest contain each about two hundred students and two
or three professors. The chief object of these institutions is to
instruct advanced scholars in composition and elegant writing;
the tutors do a little to turn attention to general literature, but
have neither the genius nor the means to make many advances.
In rural districts students are encouraged to meet at stated times
in the town-house, where the headman, or deputy of the <i>sz’</i> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
township, examines them on themes previously proposed by him.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
In large towns, the local officers, assisted by the gentry and
graduates, hold annual examinations of students, at which premiums
are given to the best essayists. At such an examination
in Amoy in March, 1845, there were about a thousand
candidates, forty of whom received sums varying from sixty to
sixteen cents.</p>

<p>One of the most notable, as well as the most ancient of collegiate
institutions, is the <i>Kwoh-tsz’ Kien</i>, or ‘School for the Sons
of the State,’ whose extensive buildings in Peking, now empty
and dilapidated, show how much easier it is to found and plan
a good thing than to maintain its efficiency. This state school
originated as early as the Chau dynasty, and the course of study
as given in the <cite>Ritual of Chau</cite> was much the same three thousand
years ago as at present. Its officers consisted of a rector,
usually a high minister of state, aided by five councillors, two
directors, two proctors, two secretaries, a librarian, two professors
in each of the six halls, and latterly five others for each of the
colleges for Bannermen. These halls are named Hall of the
Pursuit of Wisdom, the Sincere of Heart, of True Virtue, of
Noble Aspiration, of Broad Acquirements, and the Guidance of
Nature. The curriculum was not intended to go beyond the classics
and the six liberal arts of music, charioteering, archery, etiquette,
writing, and mathematics; but as if to encourage the
professors to “seek out by wisdom concerning all things that are
done under heaven,” as Solomon advises, they were told to take
their students to the original sources of strategy, astronomy, engineering,
music, law, and the like, and point out the defects and
merits of each author. The <i>Kwoh-tsz’ Kien</i> possesses now only
the husk of its ancient goodness; and if its professors were not
honored, and made eligible to be distinct magistrates after three
years’ term, the buildings would soon be left altogether empty.
Instead of reviving and rearranging it, the Chinese Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
has wisely supplanted it by a new college with its new professors
and new course of studies&mdash;the <i>Tung-wăn Kwan</i> mentioned on p.
<a href="#Page_436">436</a>. Native free schools, established by benevolent persons in
city or country, are not uncommon, and serve to maintain the literary
spirit; some may not be very long-lived, but others take
their place. In Peking, each of the Banners has its school, and so
has the Imperial Clan; retired officials contribute to schools
opened for boys connected with their native districts living in
the capital. Such efforts to promote education are expected
from those who have obtained its high prizes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROPORTION OF THOSE WHO CAN READ IN CHINA.</div>

<p>How great a proportion of the people in China can read, is a
difficult question to answer, for foreigners have had no means of
learning the facts in the case, and the natives never go into such
inquiries. More of the men in cities can read than in the country,
and more in some provinces than in others. In the district
of Nanhai, which forms part of the city of Canton, an imperfect
examination led to the belief that nearly all the men are
able to read, except fishermen, agriculturists, coolies, boat-people,
and fuelers, and that two or three in ten devote their lives
to literary pursuits. In less thickly settled districts, not more
than four- or five-tenths, and even less, can read. In Macao,
perhaps half of the men can read. From an examination of the
hospital patients at Ningpo, one of the missionaries estimated
the readers to form not more than five per cent. of the men;
while another missionary at the same place, who made inquiry in
a higher grade of society, reckoned them at twenty per cent.
The villagers about Amoy are deplorably ignorant; one lady
who had lived there over twenty years, writes that she had never
found a woman who could read, but these were doubtless from
among the poorer classes. It appears that as one goes north, the
extent and thoroughness of education diminishes. Throughout
the Empire the ability to understand books is not commensurate
with the ability to read the characters, and both have been somewhat
exaggerated. Owing to the manner in which education is
commenced&mdash;learning the forms and sounds of characters before
their meanings are understood&mdash;it comes to pass that many persons
can call over the names of the characters while they do not
comprehend in the least the sense of what they read. They can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
pick out a word here and there, it may be a phrase or a sentence,
but they derive no clearer meaning from the text before them
than a lad, who has just learned to scan, and has proceeded half
through the Latin Reader, does from reading Virgil; while in
both cases an intelligent audience, unacquainted with the facts,
might justly infer that the reader understood what he was reading
as well as his hearers did. Moreover, in the Chinese language,
different subjects demand different characters; and although a
man may be well versed in the classics or in fiction, he may be
easily posed by being asked to explain a simple treatise in medicine
or in mathematics, in consequence of the many new or unfamiliar
words on every page. This is a serious obstacle in the way
of obtaining a general acquaintance with books. The mind becomes
weary with the labor of study where its toil is neither rewarded
by knowledge nor beguiled by wit; consequently, few
Chinese are well read in their natural literature. The study of
books being regarded solely as the means wherewith to attain a
definite end, it follows naturally that when a cultivated man has
reached his goal he should feel little disposed to turn to these
implements of his profession for either instruction or pleasure.</p>

<p>Wealthy or official parents, who wish their sons to compete
for literary honors, give them the advantages of a full course in
reading and rhetoric under the best masters. Composition is
the most difficult part of the training of a Chinese student, and
requires unwearied application and a retentive memory. He
who can most readily quote the classics, and approach the nearest
to their terse, comprehensive, energetic diction and style, is,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</i>, most likely to succeed; while the man who can
most quickly throw off well rhythmed verses takes the palm
from all competitors. In novels, the ability to compose elegant
verses as fast as the pencil can fly is usually ascribed to the hero
of the plot. How many of those who intend to compete for
degrees attend at the district colleges or high schools is not
known, but they are resorted to by students about the time of
the examinations in order to make the acquaintance of those
who are to compete with them. No public examinations take
place in either day or private schools, nor do parents often visit
them, but rewards for remarkable proficiency are occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
conferred. There is little gradation of studies, nor are any
diplomas conferred on students to show that they have gone
through a certain course. Punishments are severe, and the
rattan or bamboo hangs conspicuously near the master, and its
liberal use is considered necessary: “To educate without rigor,
shows the teacher’s indolence,” is the doctrine, and by scolding,
starving, castigation, and detention, the master tries to instil
habits of obedience and compel his scholars to learn their
task.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the high opinion in which education is held,
the general diffusion of knowledge, and the respect paid to
learning in comparison with mere title and wealth, the defects of
the tuition here briefly described, in extent, means, purposes, and
results, are very great. Such, too, must necessarily be the case
until new principles and new information are infused into it.
Considered in its best point of view, this system has effected all
that it can in enlarging the understanding, purifying the heart,
and strengthening the minds of the people; but in none of these,
nor in any of the essential points at which a sound education
aims (as we understand the matter), has it accomplished half that
is needed. The stream never rises even as high as its source,
and the teachings of Confucius and Mencius have done all that
is possible to make their countrymen thinking, useful, and intelligent
men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MODE OF EXAMINATION AND CONFERRING DEGREES.</div>

<p>Turn we now from this brief sketch of primary education
among the Chinese, to a description of the mode of examining
students and conferring the degrees which have been made the
passport to office, and learn what are the real merits of the system.
Persons from almost every class of society may become
candidates for degrees under the certificates of securities, but
none are eligible for the second diploma who have not already
received the first. It therefore happens that the republican
license apparently allowed to well-nigh every subject, in reality
reserves the prizes for the few most talented or wealthy persons
in the community. A majority of the clever, learned, ambitious,
and intelligent spirits in the land look forward to these examinations
as the only field worthy of their efforts, and where they are
most likely to find their equals and friends. How much better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
for the good of society, too, is this arena than the camp or
the feudal court, the tournament or the monastery!</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXAMINATION FOR THE DEGREE OF SIU-TSAI.</div>

<p>There are four regular literary degrees, with some intermediate
steps of a titular sort. The first is called <i>siu-tsai</i>, meaning
‘flowering talent,’ because of the promise held out of the future
success of the scholar; it has often been rendered ‘bachelor of
arts’ as its nearest equivalent. The examinations to obtain it
are held under the supervision of the <i>chíhien</i> in a public
building belonging to the district situated near his yamun; and
the chief literary officer, called <i>hioh-ching</i>, ‘corrector of learning,’
or <i>kiao-yu</i>, ‘teacher of the commands,’ has the immediate
control. When assembled at the hall of examination, the district
magistrate, the deputy chancellor, and prefect, having prepared
the lists of the undergraduates and selected the themes,
allow only one day for writing the essays. The number of candidates
depends upon the population and literary spirit of the district;
in the districts of Nanhai and Pwanyu, upward of two
thousand persons competed for the prize in 1832, while in
Hiangshan not half so many came together. The rule for apportioning
them was at first according to the annual revenue.
When the essays are handed in, they are looked over by the
board of examiners, and the names of the successful students
entered on a roll, and pasted upon the walls of the magistrate’s
hall; this honor is called <i>hien ming</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘having a name in
the village.’ Out of the four thousand candidates referred to
above, only thirteen in one district, and fourteen in the other,
obtained a name in the village; the entire population of these
two districts is not much under a million and a half. Many of
the competitors at this primary tripos are unable to finish their
essays in the day, others make errors in writing, and others
show gross ignorance, all of which so greatly diminish their
numbers, that only those who stand near the head of the list of
<i>hien ming</i> do really or usually enter on the next trial before
the prefect. But all have had an equal chance, and few complain
that their performances were disregarded, for they can
try as often as they please.</p>

<p>Those who pass the first examination are entered as candidates
for the second, which takes place in the chief town of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
department before the literary chancellor and the prefect, assisted
by a literary magistrate called <i>kiao-shao</i>, ‘giver of instructions;’
it is more rigorous than that held before the <i>chíhien</i>,
though similar to it in nature. The prefect arranges the candidates
from each district by themselves according to their standing
on their several lists, and it is this vantage ground which
makes the first trial in one’s native place so important to the
ambitious scholar. The themes on which they have tested their
scholarship are published for the information of friends and the
other examiners. If the proportion given above of successful
candidates at the district examinations hold for each district,
there would not be more than two hundred students assembled
at the prefect’s hall, but the number is somewhat increased by
persons who have purchased the privilege; still the second trial
is made among a small number in proportion to the first, and
yet more trifling when compared with the amount of population.
The names of the successful students at the second trial are exposed
on the walls of the office, which is called <i>fu ming</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
‘having a name in the department,’ and these only are eligible
as candidates for the third trial. In addition to their knowledge
of the classics, the candidates at this trial are often required to
write off the text of the <cite>Shing Yu</cite>, or ‘Sacred Edict,’ from memory,
as this work consists of maxims for the guidance of officers.
The literary chancellor exercises a superintendence over the
previous examinations, and makes the circuit of the province to
attend them in each department, twice in three years. There
are various ranks among these educational officials, corresponding
to the civilians in the province; transfers are occasionally
made from one service to the other, and the oversight of the
latter is always given at the examinations wherever they are
held. Most of the literary officers, however, remain in their
own line, as it is highly honorable and more permanent. At the
third trial in the provincial capital, he confers the first degree of
<i>siu-tsai</i> upon those who are chosen out of the whole list as the
best scholars.</p>

<p>There are several classes of bachelors, depending somewhat
on the manner in which they obtained their degree; those who
get it in the manner here described take the precedence. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
possession of this degree protects the person from corporeal punishment,
raises him above the common people, renders him a
conspicuous man in his native place, and eligible to enter the
triennial examination for the second degree. Those who have
more money than learning, purchase this degree for sums varying
from $200 up to $1,000, and even higher; in later years, according
to the necessities of the government, diplomas have been
sold as low as $25 to $50, but such men seldom rise. They are
called <i>kien-săng</i>, and, as might be supposed, are looked upon
somewhat contemptuously by those who have passed through the
regular examinations, and “won the battle with their own
lance.” A degree called <i>kung-săng</i> is purchased by or bestowed
upon the <i>siu-tsai</i>, but is so generally recognized that it has almost
become a fifth degree, which does not entitle them to the
full honors of a <i>kü-jin</i>. What proportion of scholars are rewarded
by degrees is not known, but it is a small number compared
with the candidates. A graduate of considerable intelligence
at Ningpo estimated the number of <i>siu-tsai</i> in that city at
four hundred, and in the department at nearly a thousand. In
Canton City, the number of <i>shin-kin</i>, or gentry, who are allowed
to wear the sash of honor, and have obtained literary degrees, is
not over three hundred; but in the whole province there are
about twelve thousand bachelors in a population of nineteen
millions. Those who have not become <i>siu-tsai</i> are still regarded
as under the oversight of the <i>kiao-yu</i> and others of his class,
who still receive their essays; but the body of provincial
<i>siu-tsai</i> are obliged to report themselves and attend the prefectural
tripos before the chancellor, under penalty of losing all the
privileges and rank obtained. This law brings them before
those who may take cognizance of misdeeds, for these men are
often very oppressive and troublesome to their countrymen.
The graduates in each district are placed under the control of a
chief, whose power is almost equal to the deputy chancellor’s;
from them are taken the two securities required by each applicant
to enter the tripos.</p>

<p>The candidates for <i>siu-tsai</i> are narrowly examined when they
enter the hall, their pockets, shoes, wadded robes, and ink-stones,
all being searched, lest precomposed essays or other aids to com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>position
be smuggled in. When they are all seated in the hall
in their proper places, the wickets, doors, windows, and other
entrances are all guarded, and pasted over with strips of paper.
The room is filled with anxious competitors arranged in long
seats, pencil in hand, and ready to begin. The theme is given
out, and every one immediately writes off his essay, carefully
noting how many characters he erases in composing it, and hands
it up to the board of examiners; the whole day is allotted to the
task, and a signal-gun announces the hour when the doors are
thrown open, and the students can disperse. A man is liable to
lose his acquired honor of <i>siu-tsai</i> if at a subsequent inspection
he is found to have discarded his studies, and he is therefore impelled
to pursue them in order to maintain his influence, even if
he does not reach the next degree.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EXAMINATION FOR THE SECOND DEGREE.</div>

<p>Since the first degree is sometimes procured by influence and
money, it is the examination for the second, called <i>kü-jin</i>, or
‘promoted men,’ held triennially in the provincial capitals before
two imperial commissioners, that separates the candidates
into students and officers, though all the students who receive a
diploma by no means become officers. This examination is held
at the same time in all the eighteen provincial capitals, viz., on
the 9th, 12th, and 15th days of the eighth moon, or about the
middle of September; while it is going on, the city appears exceedingly
animated, in consequence of the great number of relatives
and friends assembled with the students. The persons
who preside at the examination, besides the imperial commissioners,
are ten provincial officers, with the futai at their head,
who jointly form a board of examiners, and decide upon the
merits of the essays. The number of candidates who entered
the lists at Canton in the years 1828 and 1831 was 4,800; in
1832 there were 6,000, which is nearer the usual number. In
the largest provinces it reaches as many as 7,000, 8,000, and upward.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>INTERIOR OF KUNG YUEN, OR ‘EXAMINATION HALL,’ PEKING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Previous to entering the <i>Kung Yuen</i>, each candidate has
given in all the necessary proofs and particulars, which entitle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
him to a cell, and receives the ticket which designates the one
he is to occupy. He enters the night before, and is searched to
see that no manuscript essay, “skinning paper,” or miniature
edition of the classics, is secreted on his person. If anything of
the sort is discovered, he is punished with the cangue, degraded
from his first degree, and forbidden again to compete at the examination;
his father and tutor are likewise punished. Some
of the pieces written for this purpose are marvels of penmanship,
and the most finished compositions; one set contained an essay
on every sentence in the Four Books, each of the sheets covered
with hundreds of characters, and the paper so thin that they
could be easily read through it. The practice is, however, quite
common, notwithstanding the penalties, and one censor requested
a law to be passed forbidding small editions to be
printed, and booksellers’ shops to be searched for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">METHOD OF CONDUCTING THE EXAMINATION.</div>

<p>The general arrangement of the examination halls in all the
provincial capitals is alike. A description of that at Canton,
given on page <a href="#Page_166">166</a>, is typical of them all.</p>

<p>The Hall at Peking, situated on the eastern side, not far from
the observatory, contains ten thousand cells, and these do not
always suffice for the host which assembles. The Hall at Fuhchau
is equally large; each cell is a little higher than a man’s
head, and is open on but one side&mdash;letting in more rain and wind
during inclement days than is comfortable. Confinement in
these cramped cells is so irksome as to frequently cause the death
of aged students, who are unable to sustain the fatigue, but who
still enter the arena in hopes of at last succeeding. Cases have
occurred where father, son, and grandson, appeared at the same
time to compete for the same prize. Dr. Martin<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> found that out
of a list of ninety-nine successful competitors for the second
degree, sixteen were over forty years of age, one sixty-two, and
one eighty-three. The average age of the whole number was over
thirty&mdash;while in comparison with like statistics for the third degree,
a proportionate increase might be looked for. The unpleasantness
of the strait cell is much increased by the smoke arising
from the cooking, and by the heat of the weather. All ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>vants
are provided by government, but each candidate takes in
the rice and fuel which he needs, together with cakes, tea, candles,
bedding, etc., as he can afford; no one can go in with him. The
enclosure presents a bustling scene during the examination, and
its interest intensifies until the names of the successful scholars
are published. Should a student die in his cell, the body is pulled
through a hole made in the wall of the enclosure, and left there for
his friends to carry away. Whenever a candidate breaks any of
the prescribed regulations of the contest, his name and offence are
reported, and his name is “pasted out” by placarding it on the
outer door of the hall, after which he is not allowed to enter until
another examination comes around. More than a hundred
persons are thus “pasted out” each season, but no heavy disgrace
seems to attach to them in consequence.</p>

<p>On the first day after the doors have been sealed up, four
themes are selected by the examiners from the Four Books, one
of which subjects must be discussed in a poetical essay. The
minimum length of the compositions is a hundred characters, and
they must be written plainly and elegantly, and sent in without
any names attached. In 1828, the acumen of four thousand
eight hundred candidates was exercised during the first day on
these themes: “Tsăng-tsz’ said, ‘To possess ability, and yet ask
of those who do not; to know much, and yet inquire of those
who know little; to possess, and yet appear not to possess; to
be full, and yet appear empty.’”&mdash;“He took hold of things by
the two extremes, and in his treatment of the people maintained
the golden medium.”&mdash;“A man from his youth studies eight
principles, and when he arrives at manhood, he wishes to reduce
them to practice.”&mdash;The fourth essay, to be written in
pentameters, had for its subject, “The sound of the oar, and the
green of the hills and water.” Among the themes given out
in 1843, were these: “He who is sincere will be intelligent,
and the intelligent man will be faithful.”&mdash;“In carrying out
benevolence, there are no rules.” In 1835, one was, “He acts
as he ought, both to the common people and official men, receives
his revenue from Heaven, and by it is protected and highly
esteemed.” Among other more practical texts are the following:
“Fire-arms began with the use of rockets in the Chau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
dynasty; in what book do we first meet with the word for cannon?
Is the defence of Kaifung fu its first recorded use?
Kublai khan, it is said, obtained cannon of a new kind; from
whom did he obtain them? When the Ming Emperors, in the
reign of Yungloh, invaded Cochinchina, they obtained a kind
of cannon called the weapons of the gods; can you give an account
of their origin?”</p>

<p>The three or five themes (for the number seems to be optional)
selected from the Five Classics are similar to these, but as those
works are regarded as more recondite than the Four Books, so
must the essayists try to take a higher style. An officer goes
around to gather in the papers, which are first handed to a body
of scholars in waiting, who look them over to see if the prescribed
rules have all been observed, and reject those which infringe
them. The rest are then copied in red ink, to prevent
recognition of the handwriting, and the original manuscripts
given to the governor. The copies are submitted to another
class of old scholars for their criticism, each of whom marks the
essays he deems best with a red circle, and these only are placed
in the hands of the chancellors sent from Peking for their decision.
The examining board are aided by twelve scholars of
repute, to each of whom forty or fifty essays are given to read.
The students are dismissed during the night of the ninth day,
and reassemble before sunrise of the eleventh; all whose essays
were rejected on the first review are refused entrance to their
cells. At the second tripos, five themes are given out from the
Five Classics, and everything proceeds as before in respect
to the disposal of the manuscripts. The students are liberated
early on the thirteenth as before by companies, under a salute
and music as they leave the great door; their number has been
much reduced by this time. On the next morning the roll is
called, and those who answer to their names for the last struggle
are furnished with five themes for essays, one for poetry, taken
from the classics or histories, upon doubtful matters of government,
or such problems as might arise in law and finance.
These questions take even a more extended range, including topics
relating to the laws, history, geography, and customs of the
Empire in former times, doubtful points touching the classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
works, and the interpretation of obscure passages, and biographical
notices of statesmen. It is forbidden, however, to discuss
any points relating to the policy of the present family, or the character
and learning of living statesmen; but the conduct of their
rulers is now and then alluded to by the candidates. Manuals of
questions on such subjects as candidates are examined in, are commonly
exposed for sale in shops about the time of these examinations.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
By noon of the sixteenth day of the eighth moon, all
the candidates throughout the Empire have left their halls, and
the examination is over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXAMPLE OF AN ESSAY.</div>

<p>The manner in which subjects are handled may be readily illustrated
by introducing an essay upon this theme: “When persons
in high stations are sincere in the performance of relative
and domestic duties, the people generally will be stimulated to
the practice of virtue.” It is a fair specimen of the jejune style
of Chinese essayists, and the mode of reasoning in a circle which
pervades their writings.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When the upper classes are really virtuous, the common people will inevitably
become so. For, though the sincere performance of relative duties by
superiors does not originate in a wish to stimulate the people, yet the people
do become virtuous, which is a proof of the effect of sincerity. As benevolence
is the radical principle of all good government in the world, so also benevolence
is the radical principle of relative duties amongst the people. Traced back to
its source, benevolent feeling refers to a first progenitor; traced forward, it
branches out to a hundred generations yet to come. The source of personal existence
is one’s parents, the relations which originate from Heaven are most intimate;
and that in which natural feeling blends is felt most deeply. That
which is given by Heaven and by natural feeling to all, is done without any
distinction between noble or ignoble. One feeling pervades all. My thoughts
now refer to him who is placed in a station of eminence, and who may be
called a good man. The good man who is placed in an eminent station, ought
to lead forward the practice of virtue; but the way to do so is to begin with
his own relations, and perform his duties to them.</p>

<p>“In the middle ages of antiquity, the minds of the people were not yet dissipated&mdash;how
came it that they were not humble and observant of relative duties,
when they were taught the principles of the five social relations? This
having been the case, makes it evident that the enlightening of the people
must depend entirely on the cordial performance of immediate relative duties.
The person in an eminent station who may be called a good man, is he who appears
at the head of all others in illustrating by his practice the relative duties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
To ages nearer to our own, the manners of the people were not far removed from
the dutiful; how came it that any were disobedient to parents, and without
brotherly affection, and that it was yet necessary to restrain men by inflicting
the eight forms of punishment? This having been the case, shows that in the
various modes of obtaining promotion in the state, there is nothing regarded of
more importance than filial and fraternal duties. The person in an eminent
station who may be called a good man, is he who stands forth as an example of
the performance of relative duties.</p>

<p>“The difference between a person filling a high station and one of the common
people, consists in the department assigned them, not in their relation to
Heaven; it consists in a difference of rank, not in a difference of natural feeling;
but the common people constantly observe the sincere performance of
relative duties in people of high stations. In being at the head of a family
and preserving order amongst the persons of which it is composed, there should
be sincere attention to politeness and decorum. A good man placed in a high
station says, ‘Who of all these are not related to me, and shall I receive them
with mere external forms?’ The elegant entertainment, the neatly arranged
tables, and the exhilarating song, some men esteem mere forms, but the good
man esteems that which dictates them as a divinely instilled feeling, and attends
to it with a truly benevolent heart. And who of the common people
does not feel a share of the delight arising from fathers, and brothers, and
kindred? Is this joy resigned entirely to princes and kings?</p>

<p>“In favors conferred to display the benignity of a sovereign, there should
be sincerity in the kindness done. The good man says, ‘Are not all these
persons whom I love, and shall I merely enrich them by largesses?’ He gives
a branch as the sceptre of authority to a delicate younger brother, and to another
he gives a kingdom with his best instructions. Some men deem this as
merely extraordinary good fortune, but the good man esteems it the exercise
of a virtue of the first order, and the effort of inexpressible benevolence.
But have the common people no regard for the spring whence the water flows,
nor for the root which gives life to the tree and its branches? Have they no
regard for their kindred? It is necessary both to reprehend and to urge them
to exercise these feelings. The good man in a high station is sincere in the
performance of relative duties, because to do so is virtuous, and not on account
of the common people. But the people, without knowing whence the impulse
comes, with joy and delight are influenced to act with zeal in this career of
virtue; the moral distillation proceeds with rapidity, and a vast change is effected.</p>

<p>“The rank of men is exceedingly different; some fill the imperial throne,
but every one equally wishes to do his utmost to accomplish his duty; and
success depends on every individual himself. The upper classes begin and
pour the wine into the rich goblet; the poor man sows his grain to maintain
his parents; the men in high stations grasp the silver bowl, the poor present
a pigeon; they arouse each other to unwearied cheerful efforts, and the principles
implanted by Heaven are moved to action. Some things are difficult to
be done, except by those who possess the glory of national rule; but the kind
feeling is what I myself possess, and may increase to an unlimited degree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
The prince may write verses appropriate to his vine bower; the poor man can
think of his gourd shelter; the prince may sing his classic odes on fraternal
regards; the poor man can muse on his more simple allusions to the same subject,
and asleep or awake indulge his recollections; for the feeling is instilled
into his nature. When the people are aroused to relative virtues, they will
be sincere; for where are there any of the common people that do not desire
to perform relative duties? But without the upper classes performing relative
duties, this virtuous desire would have no point from which to originate, and
therefore it is said, ‘Good men in high stations, as a general at the head of his
armies, will lead forward the world to the practice of social virtues.’”</p></div>

<p>The discipline of mind and memory which these examinations
draw out furnishes a grade of intellect which only needs the
friction and experience of public life to make statesmen out of
scholars, and goes far to account for the influence of Chinese in
Asia. The books studied in preparation for such trials must be
remembered with extraordinary accuracy, though we may wish
they contained more truth and better science. The following
are among the questions proposed in 1853, and must be taken
as an average: “In the Han dynasty, there were three commentators
on the <cite>Yih King</cite>, whose explanations, and divisions
into chapters and sentences were all different: can you give an
account of them?”&mdash;“Sz’ma Tsien took the classics and ancient
records in arranging his history according to their facts; some
have accused him of unduly exalting the Taoists and thinking
too highly of wealth and power. Pan Ku is clear and comprehensive,
but on Astronomy and the Five Elements, he has written
more than enough. Give examples and proof of these two
statements.”&mdash;“Chin Shao had admirable abilities for historical
writings. In his <cite>San Kwoh Chí</cite> he has depreciated Chu-koh
Liang, and made very light of Í and Í, two other celebrated
characters. What does he say of them?” This kind of
question involves a wide range of reading within the native literature,
though it of course contracts the mind to look upon that
literature as containing all that is worth anything in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARDUOUS LABORS OF THE EXAMINERS.</div>

<p>Twenty-five days are allowed for the examining board to decide
on the essays; and few tasks can be instanced more irksome
to a board of honest examiners than the perusal of between fifty
and seventy-five thousand papers on a dozen subjects, through
which the most monotonous uniformity must necessarily run,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
and out of which they have to choose the seventy or eighty best&mdash;for
the number of successful candidates cannot vary far from
this, according to the size of the province. The examiners, as
has already been described, are aided by literary men in sifting
this mass of papers, which relieves them of most of the labor,
and secures a better decision. If the number of students be
five thousand, and each writes thirteen essays, there will be
sixty-five thousand papers, which allots two hundred and sixty
essays for each of the ten examiners. With the help of the assistants
who are intrusted with their examination, most of the
essays obtain a reading, no doubt, by some qualified scholar.
There is, therefore, no little sifting and selection, so that when at
the last the commissioners choose three rolls of essays and poems
from each of the sessions belonging to the same scholar, to pass
their final judgment, the company of candidates likely to succeed
has been reduced as small in proportion as those in Gideon’s
host who lapped water. One of the examining committee, in
1832, who sought to invigorate his nerves or clear his intellect
for the task by a pipe of opium, fell asleep in consequence, and
on awaking, found that many of the essays had caught fire and
been consumed. It is generally supposed that hundreds of them
are unread, but the excitement of the occasion, and the dread on
the part of the examining board to irritate the body of students,
act as checks against gross omissions. Very trivial errors are
enough to condemn an essay, especially if the examiners have
not been gained to look upon it kindly. Section LII. of the code
regulates the conduct of the examiners, but the punishments are
slight. One candidate, whose essay had been condemned without
being read, printed it, which led to the punishment of the
examiner, degradation of the graduate, and promulgation of a
law forbidding this mode of appealing to the public. Another
essay was rejected because the writer had abbreviated a single
character.</p>

<p>When the names of the successful wranglers are known, they
are published by a crier at midnight, on or before the tenth of
the ninth moon; at Canton, he mounts the highest tower, and,
after a salute, announces them to the expectant city; the next
morning, lists of the lucky scholars are hawked about the streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
and rapidly sent to all parts of the province. The proclamation
which contains their names is pasted upon the governor’s office
under a salute of three guns; his excellency comes out and bows
three times towards the names of the <em>promoted men</em>, and retires
under another salute. The disappointed multitude must then
rejoice in the success of the few, and solace themselves with the
hope of better luck next time; while the successful ones are
honored and feasted in a very distinguished manner, and are the
objects of flattering attention from the whole city. On an appointed
day, the governors, commissioners, and high provincial
officers banquet them all at the futai’s palace; inferior officers
attend as servants, and two lads, fantastically dressed, and holding
fragrant branches of the olive (<i>Olea fragrans</i>) in their hands
grace the scene with this symbol of literary attainments. The
number of A.M., licentiates, or <i>kü-jin</i>, who triennially receive
their degrees in the Empire, is upwards of thirteen hundred:
the expense of the examinations to the government in various
ways, including the presents conferred on the graduates, can
hardly be less than a third of a million of taels. Besides the
triennial examinations, special ones are held every ten years,
and on extraordinary occasions, as a victory, a new reign, or an
imperial marriage. One was granted in 1835 because the Empress-dowager
had reached her sixtieth year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXAMINATIONS FOR THIRD AND FOURTH DEGREES.</div>

<p>The third degree of <i>tsin-sz’</i>, ‘entered scholars,’ or doctors, is
conferred triennially at Peking upon the successful licentiates
who compete for it, and only those among the <i>kü-jin</i>, who have
not already taken office, are eligible as candidates. On application
at the provincial treasury, they are entitled to a part of their
travelling expenses to court, but it doubtless requires some interest
to get the mileage granted, for many poor scholars are detained
from the metropolitan examination, or must beg or borrow
in order to reach it. The procedure on this trial is the
same as in the provinces, but the examiners are of higher rank;
the themes are taken from the same works, and the essays are
but little else than repetitions of the same train of thought and
argument. After the degrees are conferred upon all who are
deemed worthy, which varies from one hundred and fifty to four
hundred each time, the doctors are introduced to the Emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
and do him reverence, the three highest receiving rewards from
him. At this examination, candidates, instead of being promoted,
are occasionally degraded from their acquired standing
for incompetency, and forbidden to appear at them again. The
graduates are all inscribed upon the list of candidates for promotion,
by the Board of Civil Office, to be appointed on the first
vacancy; most of them do in fact enter on official life in some
way or other by attaching themselves to high dignitaries, or getting
employment in some of the departments at the capital.
One instance is recorded of a student taking all the degrees
within nine months; and some become <i>hanlin</i> before entering
office. Others try again and again, till gray hairs compel them
to retire. There are many subordinate offices in the Academy,
the Censorate, or the Boards, which seem almost to have been
instituted for the employment of graduates, whose success has
given them a partial claim upon the country. The Emperor
sometimes selects clever graduates to prepare works for the use
of government, or nominates them upon special literary commissions;<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
it can easily be understood that no small address in
managing and appeasing such a crowd of disciplined active
minds is required on the part of the bureaucracy, and only the
long experience of many generations of the graduates could suffice
to keep the system so vigorous as it is.</p>

<p>The fourth and highest degree of <i>hanlin</i> is rather an office
than a degree, for those who attain it are enrolled as members
of the Imperial Academy, and receive salaries. The triennial
examination for this distinction is held in the Emperor’s palace,
and is conducted on much the same plan as all preceding ones,
though being in the presence of the highest personages in the
Empire, it exceeds them in honor.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Manchus and Mongols<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
compete at these trials with the Chinese, but many facts show
that the former are generally favored at the expense of the latter;
the large proportion of men belonging to these races filling
high offices indicates who are the rulers of the land. The candidates
are all examined at Peking; one instance is recorded
of a Chinese who passed himself off for a Manchu, but afterward
confessed the dissimulation; the head of the division was
tried in consequence of his oversight. It is the professed policy
of the government to discourage literary pursuits among them,
in order to maintain the ancient energy of the race; but where
the real power is lodged in the hands of civilians, it is impossible
to prevent so powerful a component of the population
from competing with the others for its possession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS OF THE MILITARY.</div>

<p>The present dynasty introduced examinations and gradations
among the troops on the same principles as obtain in the civil
service; nothing more strikingly proves the power of literary
pursuits in China, than this vain attempt to harmonize the profession
of arms in all its branches with them. Their enemies
were, however, no better disciplined and equipped than they
themselves were. Candidates for the first degree present
themselves before the district magistrate, with proper testimonials
and securities. On certain days they are collected on
the parade-grounds, and exhibit their skill in archery (on foot
and in the saddle), in wielding swords and lifting weights,
graduated to test their muscle. The successful men are assembled
afterward before the prefect; and again at a third trial
before the literary chancellor, who at the last tripos tests them
on their literary attainments, before giving them their degrees
of <i>siu-tsai</i>. The number of successful military <i>siu-tsai</i> is the
same as the literary. They are triennially called together by
the governor at the provincial capital to undergo further examination
for <i>kü-jin</i> in four successive trials of the same nature.
These occasions are usually great gala days, and three or four
scores of young warriors who carry off prizes at these tournaments
receive honors and degrees in much the same style as
their literary compeers. The trials for the highest degree are
held at Peking; and the long-continued efforts in this service
generally obtain for the young men posts in the body-guard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
the governors or staff appointments. The forty-nine successful
candidates out of several thousands at the triennial examination
for <i>kü-jin</i> in Canton, November, 1832, all hit the target on
foot six times successively, and on horseback six times; once
with the arrow they hit a ball lying on the ground as they
passed it at a gallop; and all were of the first class in wielding
the iron-handled battle-axe, and lifting the stone-loaded beam.
The candidates are all persons of property, who find their own
horses, dresses, arms, etc., and are handsomely dressed, the
horses, trimmings, and accoutrements in good order&mdash;the arrows
being without barbs, to prevent accidents. One observer
says, “the marks at which they fired, covered with white
paper, were about the height of a man and somewhat wider,
placed at intervals of fifty yards; the object was to strike these
marks successively with their three arrows, the horses being
kept at full speed. Although the bull’s-eye was not always
hit, the target was never missed: the distance did not exceed
fifteen or twenty feet.”<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Since military honors depend so entirely on personal skill, it
may partly account for the inferior rank the graduates hold in
comparison with civilians. No knowledge of tactics, gunnery,
engineering, fortifications, or even letters in general, seems to
be required of them; and this explains the inefficiency of the
army, and the low estimation its officers are held in. Sir J.
Davis mentions one military officer of enormous size and
strength, whom he saw on the Pei ho, who had lately been
promoted for his personal prowess; and speaks of another attached
to the guard on one of the boats, who was such a foolish
fellow that none of the civilians would associate with him.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
All the classes eligible to civil promotion can enter the lists for
military honors; the Emperor is present at the examination for
the highest, and awards prizes, such as a cap decorated with a
peacock’s feather; but no system of prizes or examinations can
supply the want of knowledge and courage. Military distinctions
not being much sought by the people, and conferring but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
little emolument or power, do not stand as high in public estimation
as the present government wishes. The selection of
officers for the naval service is made from the land force, and
a man is considered quite as fit for that branch after his feats of
archery, as if the trials had been in yacht-sailing or manning
the yards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OBSERVATIONS UPON THE SYSTEM.</div>

<p>Such is the outline of the system of examinations through
which the civil and military services of the Chinese government
are supplied, and the only part of their system not to be
paralleled in one or other of the great monarchies of past or
present times; though the counterpart of this may have also
existed in ancient Egypt. “It is the only one of their inventions,”
as has been remarked, “which is perhaps worth preserving,
and has not been adopted by other countries, and carried
to greater perfection than they were equal to.” But such a
system would be unnecessary in an enlightened Christian
country, where the people, pursuing study for its own sake, are
able and willing to become as learned as their rulers desire
without any such inducement. Nor would they submit to the
trammels and trickery attendant on competition for office; the
ablest politicians are by no means found among the most
learned scholars. The honor and power of official position
have proved to be ample stimulus and reward for years of
patient study. Not one in a score of graduates ever obtains an
office, not one in a hundred of competitors ever gets a degree;
but they all belong to the literary class, and share in its influence,
dignity, and privileges. Moreover, these books render
not only those who get the prizes well acquainted with the true
principles on which power should be exercised, but the whole
nation&mdash;gentry and commoners&mdash;know them also. These unemployed
<i>literati</i> form a powerful middle class, whose members
advise the work-people, who have no time to study, and aid
their rulers in the management of local affairs. Their intelligence
fits them to control most of the property, while few
acquire such wealth as gives them the power to oppress. They
make the public opinion of the country, now controlling it,
then cramping it; alternately adopting or resisting new influences,
and sometimes successfully thwarting the acts of officials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
when the rights of the people are in danger of encroachment;
or at other times combining with the authorities to repress anarchy
or relieve suffering.</p>

<p>This class has no badge of rank, and is open to every man’s
highest talent and efforts, but its complete neutralization of
hereditary rights, which would have sooner or later made a
privileged oligarchy and a landed or feudal aristocracy, proves
its vitalizing, democratic influence. It has saved the Chinese
people from a second disintegration into numerous kingdoms,
by the sheer force of instruction in the political rights and
duties taught in the classics and their commentaries. While
this system put all on equality, human nature, as we know, has
no such equality. At its inception it probably met general
support from all classes, because of its fitness for the times, and
soon the resistance of multitudes of hopeful students against
its abrogation and their consequent disappointment in their life-work
aided its continuance. As it is now, talent, wealth, learning,
influence, paternal rank, and intrigue, each and all have
full scope for their greatest efforts in securing the prizes. If
these prizes had been held by a tenure as slippery as they
are at present in the American Republic, or obtainable only
by canvassing popular votes, the system would surely have
failed, for “the game would not have been worth the candle.”
But in China the throne gives a character of permanency to
the government, which opposes all disorganizing tendencies,
and makes it for the interest of every one in office to strengthen
the power which gave it to him. This loyalty was remarkably
shown in the recent rebellion, in which, during the eighteen
years of that terrible carnage and ruin, not one imperial official
voluntarily joined the Tai-pings, while hundreds died resisting
them.</p>

<p>There is no space here for further extracts from the classics
which will adequately show their character. They would prove
that Chinese youth, as well as those in Christian lands, are
taught a higher standard of conduct than they follow. The
former are, however, drilled in the very best moral books the
language affords; if the Proverbs of Solomon and the New
Testament were studied as thoroughly in our schools as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
Four Books are in China, our young men would be better fitted
to act their part as good and useful citizens.</p>

<p>In this way literary pursuits have taken precedence of warlike,
and no unscrupulous Cæsar or Napoleon has been able to
use the army for his own aggrandizement. The army of
China is contemptible, certainly, if compared with those of
Western nations, and its use is rather like a police, whose powers
of protection or oppression are exhibited according to the
tempers of those who employ them. But in China the army
has not been employed, as it was by those great captains, to
destroy the institutions on which it rests; though its weakness
and want of discipline often make it a greater evil than good to
the people. But had the military waxed strong and efficient,
it would certainly have become a terror in the hands of ambitious
monarchs, a drain on the resources of the land, perhaps
a menace to other nations, or finally a destroyer of its own.
The officials were taught, when young, what to honor in their
rulers; and, now that they hold those stations, they learn that
discreet, upright magistrates do receive reward and promotion,
and experience has shown them that peace and thrift are the
ends and evidence of good government, and the best tests of
their own fitness for office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIOUS RESULTS TO THE LAND AND PEOPLE.</div>

<p>Another observable result of this republican method of getting
the best-educated men into office is the absence of any
class of slaves or serfs among the population. Slavery exists in
a modified form of corporeal mortgage for debt, and thousands
remain in this serfdom for life through one reason or another.
But the destruction of a feudal baronage involved the extinction
of its correlative, a villein class, and the oppression of
poor debtors, as was the case in Rome under the consuls. Only
freemen are eligible to enter the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concours</i>, but the percentage
of slaves is too small to influence the total. To this cause, too,
may, perhaps, to a large degree, be ascribed the absence of
anything like caste, which has had such bad effects in India.</p>

<p>The system could not be transplanted; it is fitted for the
genius of the Chinese, and they have become well satisfied
with its workings. Its purification would do great good, doubtless,
if the mass of the people are to be left in their present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
state of ignorance, but their elevation in knowledge would, ere
long, revolutionize the whole. There can be no doubt as to
the important and beneficial results it has accomplished, with
all its defects, in perpetuating and strengthening the system of
government, and securing to the people a more equitable and
vigorous body of magistrates than they could get in any other
way. It offers an honorable career to the most ambitious, talented,
or turbulent spirits in the country, which demands all
their powers; and by the time they enter upon office, those
aspirations and powers have been drilled and molded into useful
service, and are ever after devoted to the maintenance of
the system they might otherwise have wrecked. Most of the
real benefits of Chinese education and this system of examinations
are reached before the conferment of the degree of <i>kü-jin</i>.
These consist in diffusing a general respect and taste for
letters among the people; in calling out the true talent of the
country to the notice of the rulers in an honorable path of effort;
in making all persons so thoroughly acquainted with the
best moral books in the language that they cannot fail to exercise
some salutary restraint; in elevating the general standard
of education so much that every man is almost compelled to
give his son a little learning in order that he may get along in
life; and finally, through all these influences, powerfully contributing
to uphold the existing institutions of the Empire.</p>

<p>From the intimate knowledge thus obtained of the writings
of their best minds, Chinese youth learn the principles of democratic
rule as opposed to personal authority; and from this instruction
it has resulted that no monarch has ever been able to
use a standing army to enslave the people, or seize the proceeds
of their industry for his own selfish ends. Nothing in Chinese
politics is more worthy of notice than the unbounded reverence
for the Emperor, while each man resists unjust taxation, and
joins in killing or driving away oppressive officials. Educated
men form the only aristocracy in the land; and the attainment
of the first degree, by introducing its owner into the class of
<em>gentry</em>, is considered ample compensation for all the expense
and study spent in getting it. On the whole, it may safely be
asserted that these examinations have done more to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
the stability, and explain the continuance, of the Chinese government
than any other single cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS PRACTICAL DEFECTS AND CORRUPTION.</div>

<p>The principal defects and malversations in the system can
soon be shown. Some are inherent, but others rather prove
the badness of the material than of the system and its harmonious
workings. One great difficulty in the way of the graduated
students attaining office according to their merits is the
favor shown to those who can buy nominal and real honors.
Two censors, in 1822, laid a document before his Majesty, in
which the evils attendant on selling office are shown; viz., elevating
priests, highwaymen, merchants, and other unworthy or
uneducated men, to responsible stations, and placing insurmountable
difficulties in the way of hard-working, worthy students
reaching the reward of their toil. They state that the
plan of selling offices commenced during the Han dynasty, but
speak of the greater disgrace attendant upon the plan at the
present time, because the avails all go into the privy purse instead
of being applied to the public service; they recommend,
therefore, a reduction in the disbursements of the imperial establishment.
Among the items mentioned by these oriental
Joseph Humes, which they consider extravagant, are a lac of
taels (100,000) for flowers and rouge in the seraglio, and 120,000
in salaries to waiting-boys; two lacs were expended on the
gardens of Yuenming, and almost half a million of taels upon
the parks at Jeh ho, while the salaries to officers and presents
to women at Yuenming were over four lacs. “If these few
items of expense were abolished,” they add, “there would be a
saving of more than a million of taels of useless expenditure;
talent might be brought forward to the service of the country,
and the people’s wealth be secured.”</p>

<p>In consequence of the extensive sale of offices, they state
that more than five thousand <i>tsin-sz’</i> doctors, and more than
twenty-seven thousand <i>kü-jin</i> licentiates, are waiting for employment;
and those first on the list obtained their degrees
thirty years ago, so that the probability is that when at last
employed, they will be too old for service, and be declared
superannuated in the first examination of official merits and demerits.
The rules to be observed at the regular examinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
are strict, but no questions are asked the buyers of office; and
they enter, too, on their duties as soon as the money is paid.
The censors quote three sales, whose united proceeds amounted
to a quarter of a million of taels, and state that the whole income
from this source for twenty years was only a few lacs.
Examples of the flagitious conduct of these purse-proud magistrates
are quoted in proof of the bad results of the plan.
“Thus the priest Siang Yang, prohibited from holding office,
bought his way to one; the intendant at Ningpo, from being a
mounted highwayman, bought his way to office; besides others
of the vilest parentage. But the covetousness and cruelty of
these men are denominated purity and intelligence; they inflict
severe punishments, which make the people terrified, and
their superiors point them out as possessing decision: these are
our able officers!”</p>

<p>After animadverting on the general practice “of all officers,
from governor-generals down to village magistrates, combining
to gain their purposes by hiding the truth from the sovereign,”
and specifying the malversations of Tohtsin, the premier, in
particular, they close their paper with a protestation of their
integrity. “If your Majesty deems what we have now stated
to be right, and will act thereon in the government, you will
realize the designs of the souls of your sacred ancestors; and
the army, the nation, and the poor people, will have cause for
gladness of heart. Should we be subjected to the operation of
the hatchet, or suffer death in the boiling caldron, we will not
decline it.”</p>

<p>These censors place the proceeds of “button scrip” far too
low, for in 1826, the sale produced about six millions of taels,
and was continued at intervals during the three following
years. In 1831, one of the sons of Howqua was created a
<i>kü-jin</i> by patent for having subscribed nearly fifty thousand
dollars to repair the dikes near Canton; and upon another was
conferred the rank and title of “director of the salt monopoly”
for a lac of taels toward the war in Turkestan. Neither of
these persons ever held any office of power, nor probably did
they expect it; and such may be the case with many of those
who are satisfied with the titles and buttons, feathers and robes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
which their money procures. The sale of office is rather accepted
as a State necessity which does not necessarily bring
tyrants upon the bench; but when, as was the case in 1863,
Peiching, head of the Examining Board at Peking, fraudulently
issued two or three diplomas, his execution vindicated
the law, and deterred similar tampering with the life-springs of
the system. During the present dynasty, military men have
been frequently appointed to magistracies, and the detail of
their offices intrusted to needy scholars, which has tended, still
further, to disgust and dishearten the latter from resorting to
the literary arena.</p>

<p>The language itself of the Chinese, which has for centuries
aided in preserving their institutions and strengthening national
homogeneity amid so many local varieties of speech, is now
rather in the way of their progress, and may be pointed to as
another unfortunate feature which infects this system of education
and examination; for it is impossible for a native to write
a treatise on grammar about another language in his own
tongue, through which another Chinese can, unaided, learn to
speak that language. This people have, therefore, no ready
means of learning the best thoughts of foreign minds. Such
being the case, the ignorance of their first scholars as regards
other races, ages, and lands has been their misfortune far more
than their fault, and they have suffered the evils of their isolation.
One has been an utter ignorance of what would have
conferred lasting benefit resulting from the study of outside
conceptions of morals, science, and politics. Inasmuch as
neither geography, natural history, mathematics, nor the history
or languages of other lands forms part of the curriculum,
these men, trained alone in the classics, have naturally grown
up with distorted views of their own country. The officials
are imbued with conceit, ignorance, and arrogance as to its
power, resources, and comparative influence, and are helpless
when met by greater skill or strength. However, these disadvantages,
great as they are and have been, have mostly resulted
naturally from their secluded position, and are rapidly yielding
to the new influences which are acting upon government and
people. To one contemplating this startling metamorphosis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
the foremost wish, indeed, must be that these causes do not
disintegrate their ancient economies too fast for the recuperation
and preservation of whatever is good therein.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SALE OF DEGREES AND FORGED DIPLOMAS.</div>

<p>Another evil is the bribery practised to attain the degrees.
By certain signs placed on the essays, the examiner can easily
pick out those he is to approve; $8,000 was said to be the
price of a bachelor’s degree in Canton, but this sum is within
the reach of few out of the six thousand candidates. The poor
scholars sell their services to the rich, and for a certain price
will enter the hall of examination, and personate their employer,
running the risk and penalties of a disgraceful exposure if
detected; for a less sum they will drill them before examination,
or write the essays entirely, which the rich booby must commit
to memory. The purchase of forged diplomas is another mode
of obtaining a graduate’s honors, which, from some discoveries
made at Peking, is so extensively practised, that when this and
other corruptions are considered, it is surprising that any person
can be so eager in his studies, or confident of his abilities,
as ever to think he can get into office by them alone. In 1830,
the <cite>Gazette</cite> contained some documents showing that an inferior
officer, aided by some of the clerks in the Board of Revenue,
during the successive superintendence of twenty presidents of
the Board had sold twenty thousand four hundred and nineteen
forged diplomas; and in the province of Nganhwui, the
writers in the office attached to the Board of Revenue had
carried on the same practice for four years, and forty-six persons
in that province were convicted of possessing them. All
the principal criminals convicted at this time were sentenced to
decapitation, but these cases are enough to show that the real
talent of the country does not often find its way into the magistrate’s
seat without the aid of money; nor is it likely that the
tales of such delinquencies often appear in the <cite>Gazette</cite>. Literary
chancellors also sell bachelors’ degrees to the exclusion of
deserving poor scholars; the office of the <i>hiohching</i> of Kiangsí
was searched in 1828 by a special commission, and four lacs of
taels found in it; he hung himself to avoid further punishment,
as did also the same dignitary in Canton in 1833, as was supposed,
for a similar cause. It is in this way, no doubt, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
the ill-gotten gains of most officers return to the general circulation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these startling corruptions, which seem to
involve the principle on which the harmony and efficiency of
the whole machinery of state stand, it cannot be denied, judging
from the results, that the highest officers of the Chinese
government do possess a very respectable rank of talent and
knowledge, and carry on the unwieldy machine with a degree
of integrity, patriotism, industry, and good order which shows
that the leading minds in it are well chosen. The person who
has originally obtained his rank by a forged diploma, or by
direct purchase, cannot hope to rise or to maintain even his first
standing, without some knowledge and parts. One of the three
commissioners whom Kíying associated with himself in his
negotiations with the American minister in 1844, was a supernumerary
<i>chíhien</i> of forbidding appearance, who could hardly
write a common document, but it was easy to see the low estimation
the ignoramus was held in. It may therefore be fairly
inferred that enough large prizes are drawn to incite successive
generations of scholars to compete for them, and thus to maintain
the literary spirit of the people. At these examinations
the superior minds of the country are brought together in large
bodies, and thus they learn each others views, and are able to
check official oppressions with something like a public opinion.
In Peking the concourse of several thousands, from the remotest
provinces, to compete at or assist in the triennial examinations,
exerts a great and healthy influence upon their rulers
and themselves. Nothing like it ever has been seen in any
other metropolis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INFLUENCE AND RESPECT OBTAINED BY BACHELORS.</div>

<p>The enjoyment of no small degree of power and influence in
their native village, is also to be considered in estimating the
rewards of studious toil, whether the student get a diploma or
not; and this local consideration is the most common reward
attending the life of a scholar. In those villages where no
governmental officer is specially appointed, such men are almost
sure to become the headmen and most influential persons in the
very spot where a Chinese loves to be distinguished. Graduates
are likewise allowed to erect flag-staffs, or put up a red sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
over the door of their houses showing the degree they have obtained,
which is both a harmless and gratifying reward of
study; like the additions of <i>Cantab.</i> or <i>Oxon.</i>, D.D. or LL.D.,
to their owner’s names in other lands.</p>

<p>The fortune attending the unsuccessful candidates is various.
Thousands of them get employment as school-teachers, pettifogging
notaries, and clerks in the public offices, and others who
are rich return to their families. Some are reduced by degrees
to beggary, and resort to medicine, fortune-telling, letter-writing,
and other such shifts to eke out a living. Many turn their
attention to learning the modes of drawing up deeds and forms
used in dealings regarding property; others look to aiding
military men in their duties, and a few turn authors, and thus
in one way or another contrive to turn their learning to account.</p>

<p>During the period of the examinations, when the students
are assembled in the capital, the officers of government are
careful not to irritate them by punishment, or offend their <i>esprit
de corps</i>, but rather, by admonitions and warnings, induce them
to set a good example. The personal reputation of the officer
himself has much to do with the influence he exerts over the
students, and whether they will heed his <i>caveats</i>. One of the
examiners in Chehkiang, irritated by the impertinence of a
bachelor, who presumed upon his immunity from corporeal
chastisement, twisted his ears to teach him better manners;
soon after, the student and two others of equal degree were
accused before the same magistrate for a libel, and one of them
beaten forty strokes upon his palms. At the ensuing examination,
ten of the <i>siu-tsai</i>, indignant at this unauthorized treatment,
refused to appear, and all the candidates, when they saw
who was to preside, dispersed immediately. In his memorial
upon the matter, the governor-general recommends both this
officer, and another one who talked much about the affair and
produced a great effect upon the public mind, to be degraded,
and the bachelors to be stripped of their honors. A magistrate
of Honan, having punished a student with twenty blows, the
assembled body of students rose and threw their caps on the
ground, and walked off, leaving him alone. The prefect of
Canton, in 1842, having become obnoxious to the citizens from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
the part he took in ransoming the city when surrounded by the
British forces, the students refused to receive him as their examiner,
and when he appeared in the hall to take his seat,
drove him out of the room by throwing their ink-stones at him;
he soon after resigned his station. Perhaps the <i>siu-tsai</i> are
more impatient than the <i>kü-jin</i> from being better acquainted
with each other, and being examined by local officers, while the
<i>kü-jin</i> are overawed by the rank of the commissioners, and,
coming from distant parts of a large province, have little
mutual sympathy or acquaintance. The examining boards,
however, take pains to avoid displeasing any gathering of graduates.</p>

<p>We have seen, then, in what has been of necessity a somewhat
cursory <i>resumé</i>, the management and extent of an institution
which has opened the avenues of rank to all, by
teaching candidates how to maintain the principles of liberty
and equality they had learned from their oft-quoted ‘ancients.’
All that these institutions need, to secure and promote the
highest welfare of the people&mdash;as they themselves, indeed,
aver&mdash;is their faithful execution in every department of government;
as we find them, no higher evidence of their remarkable
wisdom can be adduced, than the general order and peace of
the land. When one sees the injustice and oppressions in law
courts, the feuds and deadly fights among clans, the prevalence
of lying, ignorance, and pollution among commoners, and the
unscrupulous struggle for a living going on in every rank of
life, he wonders that universal anarchy does not destroy the
whole machine. But ‘the powers that be are ordained of God.’
The Chinese seem to have attained the great ends of human
government to as high a degree as it is possible for man to go
without the knowledge of divine revelation. That, in its great
truths, its rewards, its hopes, and its stimulus to good acts has
yet to be received among them. The course and results of the
struggle between the new and the old in the land of Sinim will
form a remarkable chapter in the history of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEMALE EDUCATION IN CHINA.</div>

<p>With regard to female education, it is a singular anomaly
among Chinese writers, that while they lay great stress upon
maternal instruction in forming the infant mind, and leading it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
on to excellence, no more of them should have turned their attention
to the preparation of books for girls, and the establishment
of female schools. There are some reasons for the absence
of the latter to be found in the state of society, notable
among which must stand, of course, the low position of woman
in every oriental community, and a general contempt for the
capacity of the female mind. It is, moreover, impossible to
procure many qualified schoolmistresses, and to this we must
add the hazard of sending girls out into the streets alone, where
they would run some risk of being stolen. The principal stimulus
for boys to study&mdash;the hope and prospect of office&mdash;is
taken away from girls, and Chinese literature offers little to repay
them for the labor of learning it in addition to all the
domestic duties which devolve upon them. Nevertheless, education
is not entirely confined to the stronger sex; seminaries
for young women are not at all uncommon in South China, and
it is not unusual to find private tutors giving instruction to
young ladies at their houses.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Though this must be regarded
as a comparative statement, and holding much more for the
southern than for the northern provinces, on the other hand, it
may be asserted that literary attainments are considered creditable
to a woman, more than is the case in India or Siam; the
names of authoresses mentioned in Chinese annals would make
a long list. Yuen Yuen, the governor-general of Canton, in
1820, while in office, published a volume of his deceased
daughter’s poetical effusions; and literary men are usually desirous
of having their daughters accomplished in music and
poetry, as well as in composition and classical lore. Such an
education is considered befitting their station, and reflecting
credit on the family.</p>

<p>One of the most celebrated female writers in China is Pan
Hwui-pan, also known as Pan Chao, a sister of the historian
Pan Ku, who wrote the history of the former Han dynasty.
She was appointed historiographer after his death, and completed
his unfinished annals; she died at the age of seventy,
and was honored by the Emperor Ho with a public burial, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
the title of the Great Lady Tsao. About <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 80, she was made
preceptress of the Empress, and wrote the first work in any
language on female education; it was called <cite>Nü Kiai</cite> or <cite>Female
Precepts</cite>, and has formed the basis of many succeeding
books on female education. The aim of her writings was to
elevate female character, and make it virtuous. She says, “The
virtue of a female does not consist altogether in extraordinary
abilities or intelligence, but in being modestly grave and inviolably
chaste, observing the requirements of virtuous widowhood,
and in being tidy in her person and everything about
her; in whatever she does to be unassuming, and whenever she
moves or sits to be decorous. This is female virtue.” Instruction
in morals and the various branches of domestic economy
are more insisted upon in the writings of this and other authoresses,
than a knowledge of the classics or histories of the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE “FEMALE INSTRUCTOR” ON WOMEN.</div>

<p>One of the most distinguished Chinese essayists of modern
times, Luhchau, published a work for the benefit of the sex,
called the <cite>Female Instructor</cite>; an extract from his preface will
show what ideas are generally entertained on female education
by Chinese moralists.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The basis of the government of the Empire lies in the habits of the people,
and the surety that their usages will be correct is in the orderly management
of families, which last depends chiefly upon the females. In the good
old times of Chau, the virtuous women set such an excellent example that it
influenced the customs of the Empire&mdash;an influence that descended even to
the times of the Ching and Wei states. If the curtain of the inner apartment
gets thin, or is hung awry [<i>i.e.</i>, if the sexes are not kept apart], disorder will
enter the family, and ultimately pervade the Empire. Females are doubtless
the sources of good manners; from ancient times to the present this has been
the case. The inclination to virtue and vice in women differs exceedingly;
their dispositions incline contrary ways, and if it is wished to form them alike,
there is nothing like education. In ancient times, youth of both sexes were
instructed. According to the <cite>Ritual of Chau</cite>, ‘the imperial wives regulated
the law for educating females, in order to instruct the ladies of the palace in
morals, conversation, manners, and work; and each led out her respective
classes, at proper times, and arranged them for examination in the imperial
presence.’ But these treatises have not reached us, and it cannot be distinctly
ascertained what was their plan of arrangement....</p>

<p>“The education of a woman and that of a man are very dissimilar. Thus,
a man can study during his whole life; whether he is abroad or at home, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
can always look into the classics and history, and become thoroughly acquainted
with the whole range of authors. But a woman does not study more than ten
years, when she takes upon her the management of a family, where a multiplicity
of cares distract her attention, and having no leisure for undisturbed
study, she cannot easily understand learned authors; not having obtained a
thorough acquaintance with letters, she does not fully comprehend their principles;
and like water that has flowed from its fountain, she cannot regulate
her conduct by their guidance. How can it be said that a standard work on
female education is not wanted! Every profession and trade has its appropriate
master; and ought not those also who possess such an influence over manners
[as females] to be taught their duties and their proper limits? It is a
matter of regret, that in these books no extracts have been made from the
works of Confucius in order to make them introductory to the writings on polite
literature; and it is also to be regretted that selections have not been made
from the commentaries of Ching, Chu, and other scholars, who have explained
his writings clearly, as also from the whole range of writers, gathering from
them all that which was appropriate, and omitting the rest. These are circulated
among mankind, together with such books as the <cite>Juvenile Instructor</cite>;
yet if they are put into the hands of females, they cause them to become like a
blind man without a guide, wandering hither and thither without knowing
where he is going. There has been this great deficiency from very remote
times until now.</p>

<p>“Woman’s influence is according to her moral character, therefore that point
is largely explained. First, concerning her obedience to her husband and to
his parents; then in regard to her complaisance to his brothers and sisters,
and kindness to her sisters-in-law. If unmarried, she has duties toward her
parents, and to the wives of her elder brothers; if a principal wife, a woman
must have no jealous feelings; if in straitened circumstances, she must be
contented with her lot; if rich and honorable, she must avoid extravagance
and haughtiness. Then teach her, in times of trouble and in days of ease,
how to maintain her purity, how to give importance to right principles, how
to observe widowhood, and how to avenge the murder of a relative. Is she
a mother, let her teach her children; is she a step-mother, let her love
and cherish her husband’s children; is her rank in life high, let her be
condescending to her inferiors; let her wholly discard all sorcerers, superstitious
nuns, and witches; in a word let her adhere to propriety and avoid
vice.</p>

<p>“In conversation, a female should not be froward and garrulous, but observe
strictly what is correct, whether in suggesting advice to her husband, in
remonstrating with him, or teaching her children, in maintaining etiquette,
humbly imparting her experience, or in averting misfortune. The deportment
of females should be strictly grave and sober, and yet adapted to the occasion;
whether in waiting on her parents, receiving or reverencing her husband,
rising up or sitting down, when pregnant, in times of mourning, or when
fleeing in war, she should be perfectly decorous. Rearing the silkworm and
working cloth are the most important of the employments of a female; preparing
and serving up the food for the household, and setting in order the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
sacrifices, follow next, each of which must be attended to; after them, study
and learning can fill up the time.”<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p></div>

<p>The work thus prefaced, is similar to Sprague’s <cite>Letters to a
Daughter</cite>, rather than to a text-book, or a manual intended to
be read and obeyed rather than recited by young ladies. Happy
would it be for the country, however, if the instructions given
by this moralist were followed; it is a credit to a pagan, to write
such sentiments as the following: “During infancy, a child ardently
loves its mother, who knows all its traits of goodness:
while the father, perhaps, cannot know about it, there is nothing
which the mother does not see. Wherefore the mother teaches
more effectually, and only by her unwise fondness does her son
become more and more proud (as musk by age becomes sourer
and stronger), and is thereby nearly ruined.”&mdash;“Heavenly order
is to bless the good and curse the vile; he who sins against it
will certainly receive his punishment sooner or later: from lucid
instruction springs the happiness of the world. If females are
unlearned, they will be like one looking at a wall, they will know
nothing: if they are taught, they will know, and knowing they
will imitate their examples.”</p>

<p>It is vain to expect, however, that any change in the standing
of females, or extent of their education, will take place until influences
from abroad are brought to bear upon them&mdash;until the
same work that is elsewhere elevating them to their proper place
in society by teaching them the principles on which that elevation
is founded, and how they can themselves maintain it, is
begun. The Chinese do not, by any means, make slaves of their
females, and if a comparison be made between their condition in
China and other modern unevangelized countries, or even with
ancient kingdoms or Moslem races, it will in many points acquit
them of much of the obloquy they have received on this behalf.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXTRACT FROM A GIRLS’ PRIMER.</div>

<p>There are some things which tend to show that more of the
sex read and write sufficiently for the ordinary purposes of life,
than a slight examination would at first indicate. Among these
may be mentioned the letter-writers compiled for their use, in
which instructions are given for every variety of note and epis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>tle,
except, perhaps, love letters. The works just mentioned, intended
for their improvement, form an additional fact. A
Manchu official of rank, named Sin-kwăn, who rose to be governor
of Kiangsí in Kiaking’s reign, wrote a primer in 1838, for
girls, called the <cite>Nü-rh Yü</cite>, or ‘<cite>Words for Women and Girls</cite>.’
It is in lines of four characters, and consists of aphorisms and
short precepts on household management, behavior, care of
children, neatness, etc., so written as to be easily memorized.
It shows one of the ways in which literary men interest themselves,
in educating youth, and further that there is a demand for
such books. A few lines from this primer will exhibit its
tenor:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

      <div class="verse">Keep back the heart from thoughts impure,</div>
      <div class="verse">Nor let your hands grow fond of sloth;</div>
      <div class="verse">Then no o’ersight or call deferred</div>

      <div class="verse">For this will guard from ill and woe.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The pride taken by girls in showing their knowledge of letters
is evidence that it is not common, while the general respect in
which literary ladies are held proves them not to be so very rare;
though for all practical good, it may be said that half of the
Chinese people know nothing of books. The fact that female
education is so favorably regarded is encouraging to those philanthropic
persons and ladies who are endeavoring to establish
female schools at the mission stations, since they have not prejudice
to contend with in addition to ignorance.</p>

<span class="smaller">STRUCTURE OF THE CHINESE LANGUAGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It might reasonably be inferred, judging from the attention
paid to learning, and the honors conferred upon its successful
votaries, that the literature of the Chinese would contain much
to repay investigation. Such is not the case, however, to one
already acquainted with the treasures of Western science, and, in
fairness, such a comparison is not quite just. Yet it has claims
to the regard of the general student, from its being the literature
of so vast a portion of the human species, and the result
of the labors of its wisest and worthiest minds during many
successive ages. The fact that it has been developed under a
peculiar civilization, and breathes a spirit so totally different
from the writings of Western sages and philosophers, perhaps
increases the curiosity to learn what are its excellences and
defects, and obtain some criteria by which to compare it with
the literature of other Asiatic or even European nations. The
language in which it is written&mdash;one peculiarly mystical and
diverse from all other media of thought&mdash;has also added to its
singular reputation, for it has been surmised that what is
“wrapped up” in such complex characters must be pre-eminently
valuable for matter or elegant for manner, and not less
curious than profound. Although a candid examination of
this literature will disclose its real mediocrity in points of research,
learning, and genius, there yet remains enough to
render it worthy the attention of the oriental or general student.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INFLUENCE OF THE LANGUAGE UPON LITERATURE.</div>

<p>Some of its peculiarities are owing to the nature of the language,
and the mode of instruction, both of which have affected
the style and thoughts of writers: for, having, when young,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
been taught to form their sentences upon the models of antiquity,
their efforts to do so have moulded their thoughts in the
same channel. Imitation, from being a duty, soon became a necessity.
The Chinese scholar, forsaking the leadings of his own
genius, soon learned to regard his models as not only being all
truth themselves, but as containing the sum total of all things
valuable. The intractable nature of the language, making it impossible
to study other tongues through the medium of his own,
moreover tended to repress all desire in the scholar to become
acquainted with foreign books; and as he knew nothing of
them or their authors, it was easy to conclude that there was
nothing worth knowing in them, nothing to repay the toil of
study, or make amends for the condescension of ascertaining.
The neighbors of the Chinese have unquestionably been their
inferiors in civilization, good government, learning, and wealth;
and this fact has nourished their conceit, and repressed the wish
to travel, and ascertain what there was in remoter regions. In
judging of the character of Chinese literature, therefore, these
circumstances among others under which it has risen to its
present bulk, must not be overlooked; we shall conclude that
the uniformity running through it is perhaps owing as much
to the isolation of the people and servile imitation of their
models, as to their genius: each has, in fact, mutually acted
upon and influenced the other.</p>

<p>The “homoglot” character of the Chinese people has arisen
more from the high standard of their literature, and the political
institutions growing out of its canonical books (which have
impelled and rewarded the efforts of students to master the language),
than from any one other cause. This feature offers a great
contrast to the polyglot character which the Romans possessed
even to the last, and suggests the cause and results as interesting
topics of inquiry. The Egyptian, Jewish, Syriac, Greek,
and Latin languages had each its own national literature, and
its power was enough to retain these several nations attached to
their own mother tongue, while the Gauls, Iberians, and other
subject peoples, having no books, took the language and literature
of their rulers and conquerors. Thus the kingdom, “part
iron and part clay,” fell apart as soon as the grasp of Rome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
was weakened; while the tendency in China always has been
to reunite and homologate.</p>

<p>In this short account of the Chinese tongue, it will be sufficient
to give such notices of the origin and construction of the
characters, and of the idioms and sounds of the written and
spoken language, as shall convey a general notion of all its
parts, and to show the distinction between the spoken and
written media, and their mutual action. They are both archaic,
because the symbols prevented all inflexion and agglutination in
the sounds, and all signs to indicate what part of speech each
belonged to. They are like the ten digits, containing no vocable
and imparting their meaning more to the eye than the ear.</p>

<p>Chinese writers, unable to trace the gradual formation of
their characters (for, of course, there could be no intelligible
historical data until long after their formation), have ascribed
them to Hwangtí, one of their primeval monarchs, or even earlier,
to Fuh-hí, some thirty centuries before Christ; as if they
deemed writing to be as needful to man as clothes or marriage,
all of which came from Fuh-hí. A mythical personage, Tsang-kieh,
who flourished about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2700, is credited with the invention
of symbols to represent ideas, from noticing the marking
on tortoise-shell, and thence imitating common objects in nature.</p>

<p>The Japanese have tried to attach their <i>kana</i> to the Chinese
characters to indicate the case or tense, but the combination
looks incongruous to an educated Chinese. We might express,
though somewhat crudely, analogous combinations in English
by endeavoring to write <i>1-ty</i>, <i>1-ness</i>, <i>1-ted</i>, for <i>unity</i>, <i>oneness</i>,
<i>united</i>, or <i>3-1 God</i> for <i>triune God</i>.</p>

<p>At this crisis, when a medium for conveying and giving permanency
to ideas was formed, Chinese historians say: “The
heavens, the earth, and the gods, were all agitated. The inhabitants
of hades wept at night; and the heavens, as an expression
of joy, rained down ripe grain. From the invention
of writing, the machinations of the human heart began to operate;
stories false and erroneous daily increased, litigations
and imprisonments sprang up; hence, also, specious and artful
language, which causes so much confusion in the world. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
for these reasons that the shades of the departed wept at night.
But from the invention of writing, polite intercourse and music
proceeded; reason and justice were made manifest; the relations
of social life were illustrated, and laws became fixed.
Governors had laws to which they might refer; scholars had
authorities to venerate; and hence, the heavens, delighted,
rained down ripe grain. The classical scholar, the historian,
the mathematician, and the astronomer can none of them do
without writing; were there no written language to afford proof
of passing events, the shades might weep at noonday, and the
heavens rain down blood.”<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> This singular myth may, perhaps,
cover a genuine fact worthy of more than passing notice&mdash;indicating
a consentaneous effort of the early settlers on the Yellow
River to substitute for the purpose of recording laws and events
something more intelligible than the knotted cords previously
in use. Its form presents a curious contrast to the personality
of the fable of Cadmus and his invention of the Greek letters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF THE LANGUAGE.</div>

<p>The date of the origin of this language, like that of the letters
of Western alphabets, is lost in the earliest periods of post-diluvian
history, but there can be no doubt that it is the most
ancient language now spoken, and along with the Egyptian and
cuneiform, among the oldest written languages used by man.
The Ethiopic and Coptic, the Sanscrit and Pali, the Syriac,
Aramaic, and Pehlvic, have all become dead languages; and
the Greek, Latin, and Persian, now spoken, differ so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
from the ancient style, as to require special study to understand
the books in them: while during successive eras, the written
and spoken language of the Chinese has undergone few alterations,
and done much to deepen the broad line of demarkation
between them and other branches of the human race. The
fact, then, that this is the only living language which has survived
the lapse of ages is, doubtless, owing to its ideographic
character and its entire absence of sound as an integral factor
of any symbol. Their form and meaning were, therefore, only
the more strongly united because each reader was at liberty to
sound them as he pleased or had been taught by local instructors.
He was not hindered, on account of his local <i>brogue</i>,
from communicating ideas with those who employed the same
signs in writing. Upon the subsequent rise of a great and valuable
literature, the maintenance of the written language was
the chief element of national life and integrity among those
peoples who read and admired the books. Nor has this language,
like those of the Hebrews, the Assyrians, and others
already mentioned, ever fallen into disuse and been supplanted
by the sudden rise and physical or intellectual vigor of some
neighboring community speaking a <i>patois</i>. For we find that
alphabetic languages, whose words represent at once meaning
and sound, are as dependent upon local dialects as is the
Chinese tongue upon its symbols; consequently, when in the
former case the sounds had so altered that the meanings were
obscured, the mode of writing was likely to be changed. The
extent of its literature and uses made of it were then the only
safeguard of the written forms; while as men learned to read
books they became more and more prone to associate sense and
form, regarding the sound as traditionary. We have, in illustration
of this, to look no further than to our own language,
whose cumbersome spelling is in a great measure resulting from
a dislike of changing old associations of sense and form which
would be involved in the adoption of a phonetic system.</p>

<p>The Chinese have had no inducement, at any stage of their
existence, to alter the forms of their symbols, inasmuch as no
nation in Asia contiguous to their own has ever achieved a literature
which could rival theirs; no conqueror came to impose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
his tongue upon them; their language completely isolated them
from intellectual intercourse with others. This isolation, fraught
with many disadvantages in the contracted nature of their literature,
and the reflux, narrowing influence on their minds, has
not been without its compensations. A national life of a
unique sort has resulted, and to this self-nurtured language
may be traced the origin of much of the peace, industry, population,
and healthy pride of the Chinese people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IDEOGRAPHIC NATURE OF THE SYMBOLS.</div>

<p>The Chinese have paid great and praiseworthy attention to
their language, and furnished us with all needed books to its
study. Premising that the original symbols were ideographic,
the necessities of the case compelled their contraction as much
as possible, and soon resulted in arbitrary signs for all common
uses. Their symbols varied, indeed, at different times and in
different States; it was not until a genuine literature appeared
and its readers multiplied that the variants were dropped and
uniformity sought. The original characters of this language
are derived from natural or artificial objects, of which they
were at first the rude outlines. Most of the forms are preserved
in the treatises of native philologists, where the changes they
have gradually undergone are shown. The number of objects
chosen at first was not great; among them were symbols for
the sun, moon, hills, animals, parts of the body, etc.; and in
drawing them the limners seem to have proposed nothing
further than an outline sketch, which, by the aid of a little explanation,
would be intelligible. Thus the picture <img src="images/zill_f583a.png" class="inline" alt="moon" /> would
probably be recognized by all who saw it as representing the
<i>moon</i>; that of <img src="images/zill_f583b.png" class="inline" alt="fish" /> as a <i>fish</i>; and so of others. It is apparent
that the number of pictures which could be made in this manner
would hear no proportion to the wants and uses of a language,
and therefore recourse must soon be had to more complicated
symbols, to combining those already understood, or to
the adoption of arbitrary or phonetic signs. All these modes
have been more or less employed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIX CLASSES OF CHARACTERS.</div>

<p>Chinese philologists arrange all the characters in their language
into six classes, called <i>luh shu</i>, or ‘six writings.’ The
first, called <i>siang hing</i>, morphographs, or ‘imitative symbols,’
are those in which a plain resemblance can be traced between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
the original form and the object represented; they are among
the first characters invented, although the six hundred and
eight placed in this class do not include all the original symbols.
These pristine forms have since been modified so much that
the resemblance has disappeared in most of them, caused chiefly
by the use of paper, ink, and pencils, instead of the iron style
and bamboo tablets formerly in use for writing; circular strokes
being more distinctly made with an iron point upon the hard
wood than with a hair pencil upon thin paper; angular strokes
and square forms, therefore, gradually took the place of round
or curved ones, and contracted characters came into use in place
of the original imitative symbols. In this class such characters
as the following are given:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td><img src="images/zill_f584a.png" class="inline_l" alt="gui seal script" /></td><td><img src="images/zill_f584b.png" class="inline_l" alt="che seal script" /></td><td><img src="images/zill_f584c.png" class="inline_l" alt="zi seal script" /></td><td><img src="images/zill_f584d.png" class="inline_l" alt="xiang seal script" /></td><td><img src="images/zill_f584e.png" class="inline_l" alt="lu seal script" /></td><td><img src="images/zill_f584f.png" class="inline_l" alt="hu seal script" /></td><td><img src="images/zill_f584g.png" class="inline_l" alt="shan seal script" /></td><td><img src="images/zill_f584h.png" class="inline_l" alt="mu seal script" /></td></tr>
<tr><td>tortoise,</td><td>chariot,</td><td>child,</td><td>elephant,</td><td>deer,</td><td>vase,</td><td>hill,</td><td>eye.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>altered to</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr class="large"><td>龜</td><td>車</td><td>子</td><td>象</td><td>鹿</td><td>壺</td><td>山</td><td>目</td></tr>
<tr><td>kwei,</td><td>chí,</td><td>tsz’,</td><td>siang,</td><td>luh,</td><td>hu,</td><td>shan,</td><td>muh.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The second class, only one hundred and seven in number, is
called <i>chí sz’</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘symbols indicating thought.’ They differ
from the preceding chiefly in that the characters are formed by
combining previously formed symbols in such a way as to indicate
some idea easily deducible from their position or combination,
and pointing out some property or relative circumstance
belonging to them. Chinese philologists consider these two
classes as comprising all the symbols in the language, which
depict objects either in whole or in part, and whose meaning is
apparent from the resemblance to the object, or from the position
of the parts. Among those placed in this class are,</p>

<p>
<img src="images/zill_f584i.png" class="inline" alt="xi seal script" /> moon half appearing, signifies evening; now written 夕<br />
<img src="images/zill_f584j.png" class="inline" alt="dan seal script" /> sun above the horizon, denotes morning; now written 旦<br />
<img src="images/zill_f584k.png" class="inline" alt="gan seal script" /> something in the mouth, meaning sweet; now written 甘<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span></p>

<p>The third class, amounting to seven hundred and forty characters,
is called <i>hwui í</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘combined ideas,’ or ideographs, and
comprises characters made up of two or three symbols to form a
single idea, whose meanings are deducible either from their position,
or supposed relative influence upon each other. Thus the
union of the sun and moon, <img src="images/zill_f585a.png" class="inline" alt="ming seal script" /> <i>ming</i>, expresses brightness; <img src="images/zill_f585b.png" class="inline" alt="xian seal script" />
<i>kien</i>, a piece of wood in a doorway, denotes obstruction; two
trees stand for a forest, as <img src="images/zill_f585c.png" class="inline" alt="lin seal script" /> <i>lin</i>; and three for a thicket, as <img src="images/zill_f585d.png" class="inline" alt="sen seal script" />
<i>săn</i>; two men upon the ground conveys the idea of sitting; a
<i>mouth</i> in a <i>door</i> signifies to ask; <i>man</i> and <i>words</i> means truth
and to believe; <i>heart</i> and <i>death</i> imports forgetfulness; <i>dog</i> and
<i>mouth</i> means to bark; <i>woman</i> and <i>broom</i> denotes a wife, referring
to her household duties; <i>pencil</i> and <i>to speak</i> is a book, or
to write. But in none of these compounded characters is there
anything like that perfection of picture writing stated by some
writers to belong to the language, which will enable one unacquainted
with the meaning of the separate symbols to decide
upon the signification of the combined group. On the contrary
it is in most cases certain that the third idea made by combining
two already known symbols, usually required more or less
explanation to fix its precise meaning, and remove the doubt
which would otherwise arise. For instance, the combination of
the sun and moon might as readily mean a solar or lunar eclipse,
or denote the idea of time, as brightness. A piece of wood in
a doorway would almost as naturally suggest a <i>threshold</i> as an
<i>obstruction</i>; and so of others. A straight line in a doorway
would more readily suggest a closed or bolted door, which is
the signification of 閂 <i>shan</i>, anciently written <img src="images/zill_f585e.png" class="inline" alt="shuan seal script" />; but the idea
intended to be conveyed by these combinations would need
prior explanation as much as the primitive symbol, though it
would thenceforth readily recur to mind when noticing the
construction.</p>

<p>It is somewhat singular that the opinion should have obtained
so much credence, that their meanings were easily deducible
from their shape and construction. It might almost be
said, that not a single character can be accurately defined from
a mere inspection of its parts; and the meanings now given of
some of those which come under this class are so arbitrary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
far-fetched, as to show that Chinese characters have not been
formed by rule and plummet more than words in other languages.
The mistake which Du Ponceau so learnedly combats
arose, probably, from confounding <em>sound</em> with <em>construction</em>,
and inferring that, because persons of different nations, who
used this as their written language, could understand it when
written, though mutually unintelligible when speaking, that it
addressed itself so entirely to the eye, as to need no previous explanation.</p>

<p>The fourth class, called <i>chuen chu</i>, ‘inverted significations,’
includes three hundred and seventy-two characters, being such
as by some inversion, contraction, or alteration of their parts,
acquire different meanings. This class is not large, but these
and other modifications of the original symbols to express abstract
and new ideas show that those who used the language
either saw at once how cumbrous it would become if they went
on forming imitative signs, or else that their invention failed,
and they resorted to changes more or less arbitrary in characters
already known to furnish distinctive signs for different
ideas. Thus <i>yu</i> <img src="images/zill_f586a.png" class="inline" alt="you seal script" /> the <i>hand</i>, turning toward the right means
the right; inclined in the other direction, as <i>tso</i> <img src="images/zill_f586b.png" class="inline" alt="zuo seal script" /> it means
the left. The <i>heart</i> placed beneath <i>slave</i>, 怒 signifies anger;
<i>threads obstructed</i>, as <img src="images/zill_f586c.png" class="inline" alt="sunder" />, means to sunder; but turned the
other way, as <img src="images/zill_f586d.png" class="inline" alt="continuous" />, signifies continuous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">METHOD OF FORMING PHONETIC CHARACTERS.</div>

<p>The fifth class, called <i>kiai shing</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘uniting sound symbols,’
or phonogram, contains twenty-one thousand eight hundred
and ten characters, or nearly all in the language. They
are formed of an imitative symbol united to one which merely
imparts its sound to the compound; the former usually partakes
more or less of the new idea, while the latter loses its
own meaning, and gives only its name. In this respect, Chinese
characters are superior to the Arabic numerals, inasmuch
as combinations like 25, 101, etc., although conveying the same
meaning to all nations using them, can <em>never</em> indicate sound.
This plan of forming new combinations by the union of symbols
expressing idea and sound, enables the Chinese to increase
the number of characters without multiplying the original symbols;
but these compounds, or <i>lexigraphs</i>, as Du Ponceau calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
them, do not increase very rapidly. In Annam they have become
so numerous in the course of years that the Chinese
books made in that country are hard to read. The probable
mode in which this arose can best be explained by a case which
occurred at Canton in 1832. Immature locusts were to be described
in a proclamation, but the word <i>nan</i>, by which they
were called, was not contained in any dictionary. It would be
sufficient to designate this insect to all persons living where it
was found by selecting a well-understood character, like 南
<i>south</i>, having the exact sound <i>nan</i>, by which the insect itself
was called, and joining it to the determinative symbol <i>chung</i>
虫 insect. It would then signify, to every one who knew the
sound and meaning of the component parts, the <i>insect nan</i>;
and be read <i>nan</i>, 蝻 meaning this very insect to the people in
Kwangtung. If this new combination was carried to a distant
part of the country, where the insect itself was unknown, it
would convey no more information to the Chinese who <em>saw</em> the
united symbol, than the sounds <i>insect nan</i> would to an Englishman
who <em>heard</em> them; to both persons a meaning must be
given by describing the insect. If, however, the people living
in this distant region called the phonetic part of the new character
by another sound, as <i>nam</i>, <i>nem</i>, or <i>lam</i>, they would attach
another name to the new compound, but the people on the
spot would, perhaps, not understand them when they spoke it
by that name. If they wrote it, however, both would give it
the same signification, but a different sound.</p>

<p>In this way, the thousands of characters under this class
have probably originated. But this rule of sounding them according
to the phonetic part is not in all cases certain; for in
the lapse of time, the sounds of many characters have changed,
while those of the parts themselves have not altered; in other
cases, the parts have altered, and the sounds remained; so that
now only a great degree of probability as to the correct sound
can be obtained by inspecting the component parts. The similarity
in sound between most of the characters having the same
phonetic part is a great assistance in reading Chinese, though
very little in understanding it, and has had much influence in
keeping the sounds unchanged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span></p>

<p>There are a few instances of an almost inadvertent arrival at
a true syllabic system, by which the initial consonant of one
part, when joined to the final vowel of the other, gives the
sound of the character; as <i>ma</i> and <i>fí</i>, in the character 靡,
when united in this way, make <i>mí</i>. The meanings of the components
are <i>hemp</i> and <i>not</i>, that of the compound is <i>extravagant</i>,
<i>wasteful</i>, etc., showing no relation to the primary signification.
The number of such characters is very small, and the syllabic
composition here noticed is probably fortuitous, and not intentional.</p>

<p>The sixth class, called <i>kia tsié</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘borrowed uses,’ includes
metaphoric symbols and combinations, in which the meaning is
deduced by a somewhat fanciful accommodation; their number
is five hundred and ninety-eight. They differ but little from
the second class of indicative symbols. For instance, the symbol
字 or <img src="images/zill_f588a.png" class="inline" alt="zi seal script" />, meaning a written character, is composed of a <i>child</i>
under a <i>shelter</i>&mdash;characters being considered as the well-nurtured
offspring of hieroglyphics. The character for <i>hall</i> means
also <i>mother</i>, because she constantly abides there. The word for
<i>mind</i> or <i>heart</i> is <i>sin</i> <img src="images/zill_f588b.png" class="inline" alt="xin seal script" />, originally intended to represent that
organ, but now used chiefly in a metaphorical sense. Chinese
grammarians find abundant scope for the display of their fancy
in explaining the etymology and origin of the characters, but the
aid which their researches give toward understanding the language
as at present used is small. This classification under six
heads is modern, and was devised as a means of arranging what
existed already, for they confess that their characters were not
formed according to fixed rules, and have gradually undergone
many changes.</p>

<p>The total number in the six classes is twenty-four thousand
two hundred and thirty-five, being many less than are found in
Kanghí’s Dictionary, which amount to forty-four thousand four
hundred and forty-nine; but in the larger sum are included the
obsolete and synonymous characters, which, if deducted, would
reduce it to nearly the same number. It is probable that the
total of really different characters in the language sanctioned by
good usage, does not vary greatly from twenty-five thousand,
though authors have stated them at from fifty-four thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
four hundred and nine, as Magaillans does, up to two hundred
and sixty thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine, as Montucci.
The Chinese editor of the large lexicon on which Dr. Morrison
founded his Dictionary, gives it as his opinion that there are fifty
thousand characters, including synonyms and different forms;
and taking in every variety of tones given to the words, and
sounds for which no characters exist, that there are five thousand
different words. But even the sum of twenty-five thousand different
characters contains thousands of unusual ones which are
seldom met with, and which, as is the case with old words
in English, are not often learned.</p>

<p>The burden of remembering so many complicated symbols,
whose form, sound, and meanings are all necessary to enable the
student to read and write intelligibly, is so great that the result
has been to diminish those in common use, and increase their
meanings. This course of procedure really occurs in most languages,
and in the Chinese greatly reduces the labor of acquiring
it. It may be safely said, that a good knowledge of ten
thousand characters will enable one to read any work in Chinese,
and write intelligibly on any subject; and Prémare says a
good knowledge of four or five thousand characters is sufficient
for all common purposes, while two-thirds of that number might
in fact suffice. The troublesome ones are either proper names
or technics peculiar to a particular science. The nine canonical
works contain altogether only four thousand six hundred and
one <em>different</em> characters, while in the Five Classics alone there
are over two hundred thousand words. The entire number of
different characters in the code of laws translated by Staunton is
under two thousand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MODES OF ARRANGING CHARACTERS.</div>

<p>The invention of printing and the compilation of dictionaries
have given to the form of modern characters a greater degree
of certainty than they had in ancient times. The variants of
some of the most common ones were exceedingly numerous before
this period; Callery gives forty-two different modes of
writing <i>pao</i>, ‘precious;’ and forty-one for writing <i>tsun</i>, ‘honorable;’
showing the absence of an acknowledged standard, and the
slight intercourse between learned men. The best mode of arranging
the characters so as to find them easily, has been a sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>ject
of considerable trouble to Chinese lexicographers, and the
various methods they have adopted renders it difficult to consult
their dictionaries without considerable previous knowledge
of the language. In some, those having the same sound are
grouped together, so that it is necessary to know what a character
is called before it can be found; and this arrangement
has been followed in vocabularies designed principally for the
use of the common people. One well-known vocabulary used at
Canton, called the <cite>Făn Yun</cite>, or ‘Divider of Sounds,’ is arranged
on this plan, the words being placed under thirty-three
orders, according to their terminations. Each order is subdivided
into three or four classes according to the tones, and all
the characters having the same tone and termination are placed
together, as <i>kam</i>, <i>lam</i>, <i>tam</i>, <i>nam</i>, etc. As might be supposed,
it requires considerable time to find a character whose tone is
not exactly known; and even with the tone once mastered, the
uncertainty is equally troublesome if the termination is not familiar:
for singular as it may seem to those who are acquainted
only with phonetic languages, a Chinese can, if anything, more
readily distinguish between two words <i>♯ming</i> and <i>♭ming</i>, whose
tones are unlike, than he can between <i>♯ming</i> and <i>♯meng</i>, <i>♯ming</i>
or <i>♯bing</i>, where the initial or final differs a little, and the tones
are the same.</p>

<p>An improvement on this plan of arrangement was made by
adopting a mode of expressing the sounds of Chinese characters
introduced by the Buddhists, in the <cite>Yuh Pien</cite>, published <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
543, and ever since used in all dictionaries. This takes the
initial of the sound of one character and the final of another,
and combines them to indicate the sound of the given character;
as from <i>li</i>-en and y-<i>ing</i> to form <i>ling</i>. There are thirty-six
characters chosen for the initial consonants, and thirty-eight for
the final sounds, but the student is perplexed by the different
characters chosen in different works to represent them.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> The
inhabitants of Amoy use a small lexicon called the <cite>Shih-wu
Yin</cite>, or ‘Fifteen Sounds,’ in which the characters are classified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
on this principle, by first arranging them all under fifty finals,
and then placing all those having the same termination in a
regular series under fifteen initials. Supposing a new character,
<i>chien</i>, is seen, whose sound is given, or the word is heard in
conversation and its meanings are wanted, the person turns to
the part of the book containing the final <i>ien</i>, which is designated
perhaps by the character <i>kien</i>, and looks along the initials
until he comes to <i>ch</i>, which is indicated by the character <i>chang</i>.
In this column, all the words in the book read or spoken <i>chien</i>,
of whatever tone they may be, are placed together according to
their tones; and a little practice readily enables a person speaking
the dialect to use this manual. It is, however, of little or no
avail to persons speaking other dialects, or to those whose vernacular
differs much from that of the compiler, whose own ear
was his only guide. Complete dictionaries have been published
on the phonetic plan, the largest of which, the <cite>Wu Ché Yun
Fu</cite>, is arranged with so much minuteness of intonation as to
puzzle even the best educated natives, and consequently abridge
its usefulness as an expounder of words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO COMPOSITION.</div>

<p>The unfitness of either of these modes of arrangement to find
an unknown character, led to another classification according to
their composition, by selecting the most prominent parts of
each character as its key, or radical, and grouping those together
in which the same key occurred. This plan was adopted
subsequently to that of arranging the characters according to
the sounds, about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 543, when their number was put at
five hundred and forty-two; they were afterward reduced to
three hundred and sixty, and toward the close of the Ming dynasty
finally fixed at two hundred and fourteen in the <cite>Tsz’ Lui</cite>.
It is now in general use from the adoption of the abridged
dictionary, the <cite>Kanghí Tsz’ Tien</cite>; though this number could
have been advantageously reduced, as has been shown by Gonçalves,
its universal adoption, more than anything else, renders
it the best system. All characters found under the same radical
are placed consecutively, according to the number of strokes necessary
to write them, but no regularity is observed in placing
those having the same number of strokes. The term <i>primitive</i>
has been technically applied to the remaining part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
character, which, though perhaps no older than the radical, is
conveniently denoted by this word. The characters selected for
the radicals are all common ones, and among the most ancient in
the language; they are here grouped according to their meanings
in order to show something of the leading ideas followed in
combination.</p>

<p>The number of characters found under each of these radicals
in Kanghí’s Dictionary varies from five up to one thousand three
hundred and fifty-four. The radical is not uniformly placed,
but its usual position is on the left of the primitive. Some occur
on the top, others on the bottom; some inclose the primitive,
and many have no fixed place, making it evident that no uniform
plan was adopted in the original construction. They must be
thoroughly learned before the dictionary can be readily used,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
and some practice had before a character can be quickly found.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
The groups occurring under a majority of the radicals are more
or less natural in their general meaning, a feature of the language
which has already been noticed (page <a href="#Page_375">375</a>). Some of
the radicals are interchanged, and characters having the same
meaning sometimes occur under two or three different ones&mdash;variations
which seem to have arisen from the little importance
of a choice out of two or three similar radicals. Thus the same
word <i>tsien</i>, ‘a small cup,’ is written under the three radicals
<i>gem</i>, <i>porcelain</i>, and <i>horn</i>, originally, no doubt, referring to the
material for making it. This interchange of radicals adds
greatly to the number of duplicate forms, which are still further
increased by a similar interchange of primitives having the
same sound. These two changes very seldom occur in the same
character, but there are numerous instances of synonymous
forms under almost every radical, arising from an interchange
of primitives, and also under analogous radicals caused by their
reciprocal use. Thus, from both these causes, there are, under
the radical <i>ma</i>, ‘a horse,’ one hundred and eighteen duplicate
forms, leaving two hundred and ninety-three different words;
of the two hundred and four characters under <i>niu</i>, ‘an ox,’
thirty-nine are synonymous forms; and so under other radicals.
These characters do not differ in meaning more than <i>favor</i> and
<i>favour</i>, or <i>lady</i> and <i>ladye</i>; they are mere variations in the
form of writing, and though apparently adding greatly to the
number of characters, do not seriously increase the difficulty of
learning the language.</p>

<p>Variants of other descriptions frequently occur in books,
which needlessly add to the labor of learning the language.
Ancient forms are sometimes adopted by pedantic writers to
show their learning, while ignorant and careless writers use
abridged or vulgar forms, because they either do not know the
correct form, or are heedless in using it. When such is the
case, and the character cannot be found in the dictionary, the
reader is entirely at fault, especially if he be a foreigner,
though in China itself he would not experience much difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
where the natives were at hand to refer to. Vulgar forms are
very common in cheap books and letters, which are as unsanctioned
by the dictionaries and good usage, as cockney
phrases or miner’s slang are in pure English. They arise,
either from a desire on the part of the writer to save time by
making a contracted form of few strokes instead of the correct
character of many strokes; or he uses common words to express
an energetic vulgar phrase, for which there are no authorized
characters, but which will be easily understood phonetically by
his readers. These characters would perchance not be understood
at all outside of the range of the author’s dialect, because
the phrase itself was new; their individual meaning, indeed,
has nothing to do with the interpretation of the sentence, for in
this case they are merely signs of sound, like words in other
languages, and lose their lexigraphic character. For instance,
the words <i>kia-fí</i> for coffee, <i>kap-tan</i> for captain, <i>mí-sz’</i> for Mr.,
etc., however they were written, would be intelligible to a
native of Canton if they expressed those sounds, because he was
familiar with the words themselves; but a native of Shensí
would not understand them, because, not knowing the things
intended, he would naturally refer to the characters themselves
for the meaning of the phrase, and thus be wholly misled.
In such cases, the characters become mere syllables of a phonetic
word. Foreign names are often transliterated by writers
on geography or history, and their recognition is no easy task
to their readers.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SIX STYLES OF CHINESE CHARACTERS.</div>

<p>In addition to the variations in the forms of characters, there
are six different styles of writing them, which correspond to
black-letter, script, italic, roman, etc., in English. The first is
called <i>Chuen shu</i> (from the name of the person who invented it),
which foreigners have styled the <i>seal character</i>, from its use in
seals and ornamental inscriptions. It is next to the picture hieroglyphics,
the most ancient fashion of writing, and has undergone
many changes in the course of ages. It is studied by those who
cut seals or inscriptions, but no books are ever printed in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span></p>

<p>The second is the <i>lí shu</i>, or style of official attendants, which
was introduced about the Christian era, as an elegant style to be
employed in engrossing documents. It is now seen in prefaces
and formal inscriptions, and requires no special study to read it,
as it differs but slightly from the following.</p>

<p>The third is the <i>kiai shu</i>, or pattern style, and has been gradually
formed by the improvements in good writing. It is the
usual form of Chinese characters, and no man can claim a literary
name among his countrymen if he cannot write neatly and
correctly in this style.</p>

<p>The fourth is called <i>hing shu</i>, or running hand, and is the
common hand of a neat writer. It is frequently used in prefaces
and inscriptions, scrolls and tablets, and there are books prepared
in parallel columns having this and the pattern style arranged
for school-boys to learn to write both at the same time.
The running hand cannot be read without a special study; and
although this labor is not very serious when the language of
books is familiar, still to become well acquainted with both of
them withdraws many days and months of the pupil from progress
in acquiring knowledge to learning two modes of writing
the same word.</p>

<p>The fifth style is called <i>tsao tsz’</i>, or plant character, and is a
freer description of running hand than the preceding, being full
of abbreviations, and the pencil runs from character to character,
without taking it from the paper, almost at the writer’s fancy.
It is more difficult to read than the preceding, but as the abbreviations
are somewhat optional, the <i>tsao tsz’</i> varies considerably,
and more or less resembles the running hand according to the
will of the writer. The fancy of the Chinese for a “flowing
pencil,” and a mode of writing where the elegance and freedom of
the caligraphy can be admired as much or more than the style or
sentiment of the writing, as well as the desire to contract their
multangular characters as much as possible, has contributed to introduce
and perpetuate these two styles of writing. How much
all these varieties of form superadd to the difficulty of learning
the mere apparatus of knowledge need hardly be stated.</p>

<p>The sixth style is called <i>Sung shu</i>, and was introduced under
the Sung dynasty in the tenth century, soon after printing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
wooden blocks was invented. It differs from the third style,
merely in a certain squareness and angularity of stroke, which
transcribers for the press only are obliged to learn. Of these
six forms of writing, the pattern style and running hand are the
only two which the people learn to any great extent, although
many acquire the knowledge of some words in the seal character,
and the running hand of every person, especially those engaged
in business, approaches more or less to the plant character. But
foreigners will seldom find time or inclination to learn to write
more than one form, to be able to read and communicate on all
occasions.</p>

<p>Besides these styles, there are fanciful ones, called ‘tadpole
characters,’ in imitation of various objects;<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> the Emperor
Kienlung brought together thirty-two of them in an edition of
his poem, the <cite>Elegy upon the City of Mukden</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ELEMENTARY STROKES OF THE CHARACTERS.</div>

<p>All the strokes in the characters are reduced to eight elementary
ones, which are contained in the single character
永 <i>yung</i>, ‘eternal.’</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="center" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="strokes">

<tr><td>A dot,</td><td>a line,</td><td>a perpendicular,</td><td>a hook,</td><td>a spike,</td><td>a sweep,</td><td>a stroke,</td><td>a dash-line.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Each of these is subdivided into many forms in copy-books,
having particular names, with directions how to write them,
and numerous examples introduced under each stroke.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chinese regard their characters as highly elegant, and
take unwearied pains to learn to write them in a beautiful,
uniform, well-proportioned manner. Students are provided
with a painted board upon which to practise with a brush
dipped in blackened water. The articles used in writing, collectively
called <i>wan fang sz’ pao</i>, or ‘four precious things of
the library,’ are the pencil, ink, paper, and ink-stone. The
best pencils are made of the bristly hair of the sable and fox,
and cheaper ones from the deer, cat, wolf and rabbit; camel’s
hair is not used. A combination of softness and elasticity is
required, and those who are skilled in their use discern a difference
and an excellence altogether imperceptible to a novice.
The hairs are laid in a regular manner, and when tied up are
brought to a delicate tip; the handle is made of the twigs of
a bamboo cultivated for the purpose. The ink, usually known
as India ink, is made from the soot of burning oil, pine, fir,
and other substances, mixed with glue or isinglass, and scented.
It is formed into oblong cakes or cylinders, inscribed with the
maker’s name, the best kinds being put up in a very tasteful
manner. A singular error formerly obtained credence regarding
this ink, that it was inspissated from the fluid found in the
cuttle-fish. When used, the ink is rubbed with water upon
argillite, marble, or other stones, some of which are cut and
ground in a beautiful manner. Chinese paper is made from
bamboo, by triturating the woody fibre to a pulp in mortars
after the pieces have been soaked in ooze, and then taking it
up in moulds; the pulp is sometimes mixed with a little cotton
fibre. Inferior sorts are made entirely from cotton refuse;
and in the North, where the bamboo does not grow, the bark
of the <i>Broussonetia</i>, or paper mulberry, furnishes material for
a tough paper used for windows, wrappings, and account
books, etc. Bamboo paper has no sizing in it, and is a frail
material for preserving valuable writings, as it is easily destroyed
by insects, mildew, or handling.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PAPER AND PRINTING.</div>

<p>In the days of Confucius, pieces of bamboo pared thin, palm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
leaves, and reeds, were all used for writing upon with a sharp
stick or stile. About the third century before Christ, silk and
cloth were employed, and hair pencils made for writing. Paper
was invented about the first century, and cotton-paper may
have been brought from India, where it was in use more than
a hundred years before. India ink was manufactured by the
seventh century; and the present mode of printing upon blocks
was adopted from the discovery of Fungtau in the tenth century,
of taking impressions from engraved stones. In the style
of their notes and letters, the Chinese show both neatness and
elegance; narrow slips of tinted paper are employed, on which
various emblematic designs are stamped in water lines, and enclosed
in fanciful envelopes. It is common to affix a cipher
instead of the name, or to close with a periphrasis or sentence
well understood by the parties, and thereby avoid any signature;
this, which originated, no doubt, in a fear of interception
and unpleasant consequences, has gradually become a common
mode of subscribing friendly epistles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MANUFACTURE OF CHINESE BOOKS.</div>

<p>The mode of printing is so well fitted for the language that
few improvements have been made in its manipulations, while
the cheapness of books brings them within reach of the poorest.
Cutting the blocks, and writing the characters, form two distinct
branches of the business; printing the sheets, binding the
volumes, and publishing the books, also furnish employment to
other craftsmen. The first step is to write the characters upon
thin paper, properly ruled with lines, two pages being cut upon
one block, and a heavy double line surrounding them. The
title of the work, chapter, and paging are all cut in a central
column, and when the leaf is printed it is folded through this
column so as to bring the characters on the edge and partly on
both pages. Marginal notes are placed on the top of the page;
comments, when greatly extended, occupy the upper part, separated
from the text by a heavy line, or when mere scholia, are
interlined in the same column in characters of half the size.
Sometimes two works are printed together, one running through
the volume on the upper half of the leaves, and separated from
that occupying the lower half by a heavy line. Illustrations
usually occupy separate pages at the commencement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
book, but there are a few works with woodcuts of a wretched
description, inserted in the body of the page. In books printed
by government, each page is sometimes surrounded with dragons,
or the title page is adorned in red by this emblem of imperial
authority.</p>

<p>When the leaf has been written out as it is to be printed, it
is turned over and pasted upon the block, face downward.
The wood usually used by blockcutters is pear or plum; the
boards are half or three-fourths of an inch thick, and planed
for cutting on both sides. The paper, when dried upon the
board, is carefully rubbed off with the wetted finger, leaving
every character and stroke plainly delineated. The cutter then,
with his chisels, cuts away all the blank spots in and around
the characters, to the depth of a line or more, after which the
block is ready for the printer, whose machinery is very simple.
Seated before a bench, he lays the block on a bed of paper so
that it will not move nor chafe. The pile of paper lies on
one side, the pot of ink before him, and the pressing brush on
the other. Taking the ink brush, he slightly rubs it across the
block twice in such a way as to lay the ink equally over the
surface; he then places a sheet of paper upon it, and over that
another, which serves as a tympanum. The impression is
taken with the fibrous bark of the gomuti palm; one or two
sweeps across the block complete the impression, for only one
side of the paper is printed. Another and cheaper method in
common use for publishing slips of news, court circulars, etc.,
consists in cutting the characters in blocks of hard wax, from
which as many as two hundred impressions can often be taken
before they become entirely illegible. The ink is manufactured
from lampblack mixed with vegetable oil; the printers
grind it for themselves.</p>

<p>The sheets are taken by the binder, who folds them through
the middle by the line around the pages, so that the columns
shall register with each other, he then collates them into volumes,
placing the leaves evenly by their folded edge, when the
whole are arranged, and the covers pasted on each side. Two
pieces of paper stitch it through the back, the book is trimmed,
and sent to the bookseller. If required, it is stitched firmly with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
thread, but this part, as well as writing the title on the bottom
edges of the volume, and making the pasteboard wrapper, are
usually deferred till the taste of a purchaser is ascertained.
Books made of such materials are not as durable as European
volumes, and those who can afford the expense frequently have
valuable works inclosed in wooden boxes. They are printed of
all sizes between small <i>sleeve</i> editions (as the Chinese call 24
and 32 mos) up to quartos, twelve or fourteen inches square,
larger than which it is difficult to get blocks.</p>

<p>The price varies from one cent&mdash;for a brochure of twenty-five
or thirty pages&mdash;to a dollar and a half a volume. It is
seldom higher save for illustrated works. A volume rarely
contains more than a hundred leaves, and in fine books their
thickness is increased by inserting an extra sheet inside of each
leaf. At Canton or Fuhchau, the <cite>History of the Three States</cite>,
bound in twenty-one volumes 12mo, printed on white paper, is
usually sold for seventy-five cents or a dollar per set.
Kanghí’s Dictionary, in twenty-one volumes 8vo, on yellow
paper, sells for four dollars; and all the nine classics can be
purchased for less than two. Books are hawked about the
streets, circulating libraries are carried from house to house
upon movable stands, and booksellers’ shops are frequent in
large towns. No censorship, other than a prohibition to write
about the present dynasty, is exercised upon the press; nor are
authors protected by a copyright law. Men of wealth sometimes
show their literary taste by defraying the expense of getting
the blocks of extensive works cut, and publishing them.
Pwan Sz’-ching, a wealthy merchant at Canton, published, in
1846, an edition of the <cite>Pei Wăn Yun Fu</cite>, in one hundred and
thirty thick octavo volumes, the blocks for which must have
cost him more than ten thousand dollars. The number of good
impressions which can be obtained from a set of blocks is about
sixteen thousand, and by retouching the characters, ten thousand
more can be struck off.</p>

<p>The disadvantages of this mode of printing are that other
languages cannot easily be introduced into the page with the
Chinese characters; the blocks occupy much room, are easily
spoiled or lost; and are incapable of correction without much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
expense. It possesses some compensatory advantages peculiar
to the Chinese and its cognate languages, Manchu, Corean, Japanese,
etc., all of which are written with a brush and have
few or no circular strokes. Its convenience and cheapness,
coupled with the low rate of wages, will no doubt make it the
common mode of printing Chinese among the people for a long
time.</p>

<p>The honor of being the first inventor of movable types undoubtedly
belongs to a Chinese blacksmith named Pí Shing, who
lived about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1000, and printed books with them nearly five
hundred years before Gutenberg cut his matrices at Mainz.
They were made of plastic clay, hardened by fire after the
characters had been cut on the soft surface of a plate of clay in
which they were moulded. The porcelain types were then set
up in a frame of iron partitioned off by strips, and inserted in a
cement of wax, resin, and lime to fasten them down. The printing
was done by rubbing, and when completed the types were
loosened by melting the cement, and made clean for another impression.</p>

<p>This invention seems never to have been developed to any
practical application in superseding block-printing. The Emperor
Kanghí ordered about two hundred and fifty thousand
copper types to be engraved for printing publications of the government,
and these works are now highly prized for their beauty.
The cupidity of his successors led to melting these types into
cash, but his grandson Kienlung directed the casting of a large
font of lead types for government use.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOVABLE CHINESE TYPES MADE BY FOREIGNERS.</div>

<p>The attention of foreigners was early called to the preparation
of Chinese movable types, especially for the rapid manufacture
of religious books, in connection with missionary work. The
first fonts were made by P. P. Thoms, for the E. I. Company’s
office at Macao in 1815, for the purpose of printing Morrison’s
Dictionary. The characters were cut with chisels on blocks of
type metal or tin, and though it was slow work to cut a full
font, they gradually grew in numbers and variety till they served
to print over twenty dictionaries and other works, designed
to aid in learning Chinese, before they were destroyed by fire
in 1856. A small font had been cast at Serampore in 1815,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
and in 1838, the Royal Printing Office at Paris had obtained
a set of blocks engraved in China, from which thick castings
were made and the separate types obtained by sawing the plates.
M. Le Grand, a type-founder in Paris, about the year 1836,
prepared an extensive font of type with comparatively few
matrices, by casting the radical and primitive on separate bodies;
and the plan has been found, within certain limits, to save so
much expense and room that it has been adopted in other fonts.</p>

<p>These experiments in Europe showed the feasibility of making
and using Chinese type to any extent, but their results as to elegance
and accuracy of form were not satisfactory, and proved
that native workmen alone could meet the native taste. Rev.
Samuel Dyer of the London Mission at Singapore began in
1838, under serious disadvantages, for he was not a practical
printer, to cut the matrices for two complete fonts. He continued
at his self-appointed task until his death in 1844, having
completed only one thousand eight hundred and forty-five
punches. His work was continued by R. Cole, of the American
Presbyterian Missions, a skilful mechanic in his line, and in
1851 he was able to furnish fonts of two sizes with four thousand
seven hundred characters each. Their form and style met every
requirement of the most fastidious taste, and they are now in
constant use.</p>

<p>While Mr. Dyer’s fonts were suspended by his death, an attempt
was made by a benevolent printer, Herr Beyerhaus of
Berlin, to make one of an intermediate size on the Le Grand
principle of divisible types; his proposal was taken up by the
Presbyterian Board of Missions in New York, and after many
delays a beautiful font was completed and in use about 1859.
At this time, Mr. W. Gamble of that Mission in Shanghai, carried
out his plan of making matrices by the electrotype process,
and completed a large font of small pica type in about as many
months as Dyer and Beyerhaus had taken years. By means of
these various fonts books are now printed in many parts of
China, in almost any style, and type foundries cast in whatever
quantities are needed. The government has opened an extensive
printing office in Peking, and its example will encourage
native booksellers to unite typography with xylographic print<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>ing.
More than this as conducing to the diffusion of knowledge
among the people is the stimulus these cheap fonts of type have
given to the circulation of newspapers in all the ports; but for
their convenient and economical use Chinese newspapers could
not have been printed at all. It will be quite within the reach
of native workmen, who are skilled in electrotyping, stereotyping,
and casting type, to make types of all sizes and styles for
their own books, as the growing intelligence of the people creates
a demand for illustrated and scientific publications, as well
as cheap ones.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PHONETIC CHARACTER OF THE LANGUAGE.</div>

<p>Nothing has conduced more to a misapprehension of the nature
of the Chinese language than the way in which its phonetic
character has been spoken of by different authors. Some,
describing the primitive symbols, and the modifications they
have undergone, have conveyed the impression that the whole
language consisted of hieroglyphic or ideographic signs, which
depicted ideas, and conveyed their meaning entirely to the eye,
irrespective of the sound. For instance, Rémusat says, “The
character is not the delineation of the sound, nor the sound the
expression of the character;” forgetting to ask himself how or
when a character in any language ever delineated a sound. Yet
every Chinese character is sounded as much as the words in alphabetic
languages, and some have more than one to express
their different meanings; so that, although the character could
not delineate the sound of the thing it denoted, the sound is the
expression of the character. Others, as Mr. Lay,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> have dissected
the characters, and endeavored to trace back some analogy in the
meanings of all those in which the same primitive is found, and
by a sort of analysis, to find out how much of the signification
of the radical was infused into the primitive to form the present
meaning. His plan, in general terms, is to take all the characters
containing a certain primitive, and find out how much of
the meaning of that primitive is contained in each one; then
he reconstructs the series by defining the primitive, incidentally
showing the intention of the framers of the characters in choos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>ing
that particular one, and apportioning so much of its aggregate
meaning to each character as is needed, and adding the
meaning of the radical to form its whole signification. If we
understand his plan, he wishes to construct a formula for each
group containing the same primitive, in which the signification
of the primitive is a certain function in that of all the characters
containing it; to add up the total of their meanings, and divide
the amount among the characters, allotting a quotient to each
one. Languages are not so formed, however, and the Chinese
is no exception. Some of Mr. Lay’s statements are correct, but
his theory is fanciful. It is impossible to decide what proportion
was made by combining a radical and a primitive with any
reference to their meanings, according to Mr. Lay’s theory, and
how many of them were simply phonetic combinations; probably
nine-tenths of the compound characters have been constructed
on the latter principle.</p>

<p>The fifth class of syllabic symbols were formed by combining
the symbolic and syllabic systems, so as to represent sound
chiefly, but bearing in the construction of each one some reference
to its general signification. The original hieroglyphics contained
no sound, <i>i.e.</i>, were not formed of phonetic constituents;
the object depicted had a name, but there was no clue to it. It
was impossible to do both&mdash;depict the object, and give its name
in the same character. At first, the number of people using
these ideographic symbols being probably small, every one
called them by the same name, as soon as he knew what they
represented, and began to read them. But when the ideas attempted
to be written far exceeded in number the symbols, or,
what is more likely, the invention of the limners, recourse was
had to the combination of the symbols already understood to express
the new idea. This was done in several modes, as noticed
above, but the syllabic system needs further explanation, from
the extent to which it has been carried. The character 蝻 <i>nan</i>,
to denote the young of the locust, has been adduced. The
same principle would be applied in <em>reading</em> every new character,
of which the phonetic primitive merely was recognized, although
its meaning might not be known. Probably all the characters
in the fifth class were sounded in strict accordance with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
phonetic primitives when constructed, but usage has changed
some of their sounds, and many characters belonging to other
classes, apparently containing the same primitive, are sounded
quite differently; this tends to mislead those who infer the
sound from the primitive. This mode of constructing and
naming the characters also explains the reason why there are so
few sounds compared with the number of characters; the phonetic
primitive perpetuated its name in all its progeny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MODES OF INCORPORATING NEW WORDS.</div>

<p>More than seven-eighths of the characters have been formed
from less than two thousand symbols, and it is difficult to imagine
how it could have been used so long and widely without
some such method to relieve the memory of the burden of retaining
thousands of arbitrary marks. But, until the names
and meanings of the original symbols are learned, neither the
sound nor sense of the compound characters will be more apparent
to a Chinese than they are to any one else; until those are
known, their combinations cannot be understood, nor even then
the meaning wholly deduced; each character must be learned
by itself, just as words in other languages. The sounds given
the original symbols doubtless began to vary early after coming
into use. Intercommunication between different parts of the
country was not so frequent as to prevent local dialects from
arising; but however strong the tendency of the spoken monosyllables
to coalesce into polysyllables, the intractable symbols
kept them apart. It is surprising, too, what a tendency the
mind has to trust to the eye rather than to the ear, in getting
and retaining the sense of a book; it is shown in many ways,
and arises from habit more than any real difficulty in catching
the idea <i>vivâ voce</i>. If the characters could have coalesced,
their names would soon have run together, and been modified
as they are in other languages. The classics, dictionaries, and
unlimited uses of a written language, maintained the same meaning;
but as their sounds must be learned traditionally, endless
variations and patois arose. Moreover, as new circumstances
and increasing knowledge give rise to new words in all countries,
so in China, new scenes and expressions arise requiring to be
incorporated into the written language. Originally they were
unwritten though well understood sounds; and when first writ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>ten
must be explained, as is the case with foreign words like
<i>tabu</i>, <i>ukase</i>, <i>vizier</i>, etc., <i>ad infin.</i>, when introduced into English.
Different writers might, however, employ different primitives
to express the sound, not aware that it had already been
written, and hence would arise synonyms; they might use dissimilar
radicals, and this as well would increase the modes of
writing the sound. But the inconvenience of thus multiplying
characters would be soon perceived in the obscurity of the sentence,
for if the new character was not in the dictionary, its
sound and composition were not enough to explain the meaning.
When the language had attained a certain copiousness, the mode
of education and the style of literary works compelled scholars
to employ such characters only as were sanctioned by good use,
or else run the risk of not being understood.</p>

<p>The unwritten sounds, however, could not wait for this slow
mode of adoption, but the risk of being misunderstood by using
characters phonetically led to descriptive terms, conveying the
idea and not the sound. Where alphabetic languages adopt a
technic for a new thing, the Chinese make a new phrase. This
is illustrated by the terms <i>Hung-mao jin</i>, or ‘Red Bristled
men,’ for Englishmen; <i>Hwa-kí</i>, or ‘Flowery Flag,’ for Americans;
<i>Sí-yang</i>, or ‘Western Ocean,’ for Portuguese, etc., used at
Canton, instead of the proper names of those countries. Cause
and effect act reciprocally upon each other in this instance; the effect
of using unsanctioned characters to express unwritten sounds,
is to render a composition obscure, while the restriction to a set of
characters compels their meaning to be sufficiently comprehensive
to include all occasions. Local, unwritten phrases, and
unauthorized characters, are so common, however, owing to
the partial communication between distant parts of so great a
country and mass of people, that it is evident, if this bond of
union were removed by the substitution of an alphabetical language,
the Chinese would soon be split into many small nations.
However desirable, therefore, might be the introduction of a
written language less difficult of acquisition, and more flexible,
there are some reasons for wishing it to be delayed until
more intelligence is diffused and juster principles of government
obtain. When the people themselves feel the need of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
they will contrive some better medium for the promotion of
knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“CLAM-SHELL WORDS” AND TONES.</div>

<p>The monosyllabic sound of the primitive once imparted to
the ideophonous compound, explains the existence of so many
characters having the same sound. When these various characters
were presented to the eye of the scholar, no trouble was
felt in recognizing their sense and sound, but confusion was experienced
in speaking. This has been obviated in two ways.
One is by repeating a word, or joining two of similar meanings
but of different sounds, to convey a single idea; or else by adding
a classifying word to express its nature. Both these modes
do in fact form a real dissyllable, and it would appear so in an
alphabetical language. The first sort of these <i>hien-hioh sz’</i>, or
‘clam-shell words,’ as they are called, are not unfrequent in books,
far more common in conversation and render the spoken more
diffuse than the written language&mdash;more so, perhaps, than is the
case in other tongues. Similar combinations of three, four, and
more characters occur, especially where a foreign article or term
is translated, but the genius of the language is against the use
of polysyllables. Such combinations in English as <i>household</i>,
<i>house-warming</i>, <i>housewife</i>, <i>house-room</i>, <i>houseleeks</i>, <i>hot-house</i>,
<i>wood-house</i>, <i>household-stuff</i>, etc., illustrate these dissyllables in
Chinese; but they are not so easily understood. Such terms as
<i>understand</i>, <i>courtship</i>, <i>withdraw</i>, <i>upright</i>, etc., present better
analogies to the Chinese compounds. In some the real meaning
is totally unlike either of the terms, as <i>tungkia</i> (lit. ‘east house’),
for master; <i>tungsí</i> (lit. ‘east west’), for thing; <i>kungchu</i> (lit.
‘lord ruler’), for princess, etc. The classifiers partake of the
nature of adjectives, and serve not only to sort different words,
but the same word when used in different senses. They correspond
to such words in English as <i>herd</i>, <i>fleet</i>, <i>troop</i>, etc. To say
a fleet of cows, a troop of ships, or a herd of soldiers, would be
ridiculous only in English, but a similar misapplication would
confuse the sense in Chinese.</p>

<p>The other way of avoiding the confusion of homophonous
monosyllables, which, notwithstanding the “clam-shell words,”
and the extensive use of classifiers, are still liable to misapprehension,
is by accurately marking its right <i>shing</i> or tone, but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
nothing analogous to them is found in European languages, it is
rather difficult to describe them. At Canton there are eight
arranged in an upper and lower series of four each; at Peking
there are only four, at Nanking five, and at Swatow seven. The
Chinese printers sometimes mark the <i>shing</i> on certain ambiguous
characters, by a semicircle put on one corner; but this is
rarely done, as every one who can read is supposed to know how
to speak, and consequently to be familiar with the right tone.
These four tones are called <i>ping</i>, <i>shang</i>, <i>kü</i>, and <i>jih</i>, meaning,
respectively, the <i>even</i>, <i>ascending</i>, <i>departing</i>, and <i>entering</i> tone.
They are applied to every word, and have nothing to do either
with accent or emphasis; in asking or answering, entreating or
refusing, railing or flattering, soothing or recriminating, they remain
ever the same. The unlettered natives, even children and
females, who know almost nothing of the distinctions into four,
five, seven, or eight <i>shing</i>, observe them closely in their speech,
and detect a mispronunciation as soon as the learned man. A
single illustration of them will suffice. The <i>even</i> tone is the natural
expression of the voice, and native writers consider it the
most important. In the sentence,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When I asked him, ‘Will you let me see it?’ he said, ‘No, I’ll do no
such thing,’”</p></div>

<p>the different cadence of the question and reply illustrate the
upper and lower even tone. The <i>ascending</i> tone is heard in
exclamatory words as <i>ah! indeed!</i> It is a little like the crescendo
in music, while the <i>departing</i> tone corresponds in the
same degree to the diminuendo. The drawling tone of repressed
discontent, grumbling and eking out a reply, is not unlike the
departing tone. The entering tone is nearly eliminated in the
northern provinces, but gives a marked feature to speech in the
southern; it is an abrupt ending, in the same modulation that
the even tone is, but as if broken off; a man about to say <i>lock</i>,
and taken with a hiccup in the middle so that he leaves off the
last two letters, or the final consonant, pronounces the <i>juh shing</i>.
A few characters have two tones, which give them different
meanings; the <i>ping shing</i> often denotes the substantive, and the
<i>kü shing</i>, the verb, but there is no regularity in this respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span></p>

<p>The tones are observed by natives of all ranks, speaking all
patois and dialects, and on all occasions. They present a serious
difficulty to the adult foreigner of preaching or speaking acceptably
to the natives, for although by a proper use of classifiers,
observance of idioms, and multiplication of synonyms, he may
be understood, his speech will be rude and his words distasteful,
if he does not learn the tones accurately. In Amoy and Fuhchau,
he will also run a risk of being misunderstood. If the
reader, in perusing the following sentence, will accent the italicized
syllables, he will have an imperfect illustration of the confusion
a wrong intonation produces: “The pre<em>sent</em> of that ob<em>ject</em>
occasioned such a trans<em>port</em> as to <em>ab</em>stract my mind from all
around.” In Chinese, however, it is not <em>accent</em> upon one of two
syllables which must be learned, but the integral tone of a single
sound, as much as in the musical octave.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary here to enter into any detailed description or
enumeration of the words in the Chinese language. One remarkable
feature is the frequency of the termination <i>ng</i> preceded
by all the vowels, which imparts a peculiar singing
character to Chinese speech, as <i>Kwangtung</i>, <i>Yangtsz’ kiang</i>,
etc. In a list of sounds in the court dialect, about one-sixth of
the syllables have this termination, but a larger proportion of
characters are found under those syllables, than the mere list indicates.
In Morrison’s Dictionary the number of separate words
in the court dialect is 411, but if the aspirated syllables be distinguished,
there are 533. In the author’s <cite>Syllabic Dictionary</cite>
the number is 532; Wade reduces the Peking dialect to 397
syllables in one list, and increases it to 420 in another. In the
Cantonese there are 707; in the dialect of Swatow, 674; at
Amoy, about 900; at Fuhchau, 928; and 660 at Shanghai. All
these lists distinguish between aspirated and unaspirated words,
as <i>ting</i> and <i>t’ing</i>, <i>pa</i> and <i>p’a</i>, which to an English ear are
nearly identical. The largest part of the sounds are common
to the dialects, but the distinctions are such as to render it easy
to detect each when spoken; the court dialect is the most mellifluous
of the whole and easiest to acquire. All the consonants
in English are found in one or another of the dialects, besides
many not occurring in that language, as <i>bw</i>, <i>chw</i>, <i>gw</i>, <i>jw</i>, <i>lw</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
<i>mw</i>, <i>nw</i>, etc. There are also several imperfect vowel sounds
not known in any European language, as <i>hm</i> or <i>’m</i>, <i>hn</i> or <i>’n</i>, <i><sup>ng</sup></i> (a
high nasal sound), <i>sz’</i>, <i>’rh</i>, <i>ch’</i>, etc. The phrase <i>’m ’ng tăk</i> in the
Canton dialect, meaning <i>cannot be pushed</i>, or <i>chain<sup>n</sup> mai<sup>n</sup> lang</i>,
‘a blind man,’ in the Amoy, cannot be so accurately expressed
by these or any other letters that one can learn the sound from
them. If it is difficult for us to express their sounds by Roman
letters, it is still stranger for the Chinese to write English words.
For instance, <i>baptize</i> in the Canton dialect becomes <i>pa-pí-tai-sz’</i>;
<i>flannel</i> becomes <i>fat-lan-yin</i>; <i>stairs</i> becomes <i>sz’-ta-sz’</i>; <i>impregnable</i>
becomes <i>ím-pí-luk-na-pu-lí</i>; etc. Such words as <i>Washington</i>,
<i>midshipman</i>, <i>tongue</i>, etc., can be written nearer their
true sound, but the indivisible Chinese monosyllables offer a
serious obstacle in the way of introducing foreign words and
knowledge into the language.</p>

<p>The preceding observations explain how the numerous local
variations from the general language found in all parts of China
have arisen. Difficult as the spoken language is for a foreigner
to acquire, from the brevity of the words and nicety of their
tones, the variety of the local pronunciations given to the same
character adds not a little to the labor, especially if he be situated
where he is likely to come in contact with persons from
different places. Amid such a diversity of pronunciation, and
where one sound is really as correct as another, it is not easy to
define what should constitute a dialect, a patois, or a corruption.
A dialect in other languages is usually described as a local variation
in pronunciation, or the use of peculiar words and expressions,
not affecting the idiom or grammar of the tongue; but in
the Chinese, where the written character unites the mass of
people in one language, a dialect has been usually regarded by
those who have written on the subject, as extending to variations
in the idiom, and not restricted to differences in pronunciation
and local expressions. According to this definition, there are
only four or five dialects (which would in fact be as many languages
if they were not united by the written character), but an
endless variety of patois or local pronunciations. The Chinese
have published books to illustrate the court, Changchau or Amoy,
the Canton and Fuhchau dialects. The differences in the idi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>oms
and pronunciation are such as to render persons speaking
them mutually unintelligible, but do not affect the style of writing,
whose idioms are founded upon the usage of the best writers,
and remain unchanged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COURT, OR MANDARIN DIALECT.</div>

<p>The court language, the <i>kwan hwa</i>, or mandarin dialect, is
rather the proper language of the country&mdash;<em>the Chinese language</em>&mdash;than
a dialect. It is studied and spoken by all educated
men, and no one can make any pretence to learning or
accomplishments who cannot converse in it in whatever part
of the Empire he may be born. It is the common language
throughout the northeastern provinces, especially Honan, Shantung,
and Nganhwui, though presenting more or less variations
even in them from the standard of the court and capital.
This speech is characterized by its soft and mellifluous tones,
the absence of all harsh, consonantal endings, and the prevalence
of liquids and labials. In parts of the provinces
where it is spoken, as the eastern portions of Chehkiang and
Kiangsu, gutturals are common, and the initials softened or
changed.</p>

<p>This tongue is the most ancient speech now spoken, for
stanzas of poetry written twenty-five centuries ago, in the times
previous to Confucius, are now read with the same rhymes as
when penned. The expressions of the <i>kwan hwa</i>, although resembling
the written language more than the other dialects, are
still unlike it, being more diffuse, and containing many synonyms
and particles not required to make the sense clear when
it is addressed to the eye. The difference is such in this respect
that two well-educated Chinese speaking in the terse style
of books would hardly understand each other, and be obliged
to use more words to convey their meaning when speaking than
they would consider elegant or necessary in an essay. This is,
to be sure, more or less the case in all languages, but from the
small variety of sounds and their monosyllabic brevity, it is unavoidable
in Chinese, though it must not be inferred that the
language cannot be written so as to be understood when read
off; it can be written as diffusely as it is spoken, but such a
style is not considered very elegant. There are books written
in the colloquial, however, from which it is not difficult to learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
the style of conversation, and such books are among the best to
put into the hands of a foreigner when beginning the study.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIALECTS OF CANTON AND AMOY.</div>

<p>The local patois of a place is called <i>tu tan</i>, or <i>hiang tan</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
local or village brogue, and there is an interpreter of it attached
to almost every officer’s court for the purpose of translating the
peculiar phrases of witnesses and others brought before him.
The term <i>dialect</i> cannot, strictly, in its previous definition, be
applied to the <i>tu tan</i>, though it is usually so called; it is a
patois or brogue. The Canton dialect is called by its citizens
<i>pak wa</i>, ‘the plain speech,’ because it is more intelligible
than the court dialect. It is comparatively easy of acquisition,
and differs less from the <i>kwan hwa</i>, in its pronunciation and
idioms, than that of Amoy and its vicinity; but the diversity
is still enough to render it unintelligible to people from the
north. A very few books have been written in it, but none
which can afford assistance in learning it. A native scholar
would consider his character for literary attainments almost degraded
if he should write books in the provincial dialects, and
forsake the style of the immortal classics. The principal feature
in the pronunciation of the Canton dialect which distinguishes
it from the general language, is the change of the abrupt
vowel terminations, as <i>loh</i>, <i>kiah</i>, <i>pih</i>, into the well-defined
consonants <i>k</i>, <i>p</i>, and <i>t</i>, as <i>lok</i>, <i>kap</i>, <i>pít</i>, a change that considerably
facilitates the discrimination of the syllables. The idioms
of the two cannot well be illustrated without the help of the
written character, but the differences between the sounds of
two or three sentences may be exhibited: The phrase, <i>I do not
understand what he says</i>, is in the</p>

<p>Court dialect: <i>Wo min puh tung teh ta kiang shim mo.</i></p>

<p>Canton dialect: <i>Ngo ’m hiu kü kong măt yé.</i></p>

<p><i>The rice contains sand in it.</i></p>

<p>Court dialect: <i>Na ko mí yu sha tsz’.</i></p>

<p>Canton dialect: <i>Ko tik mai yau sha tsoi noi.</i></p>

<p>None of the provincial patois differ so much from the <i>kwan
hwa</i>, and afford so many peculiarities, as those spoken in the
province of Fuhkien and eastern portions of Kwangtung. All
of them are nasal, and, compared with those spoken elsewhere,
harsh and rough. They have a large number of unwritten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
sounds, and so supply the lack; the same character often has
one sound when read and another when spoken; all of them
are in common use. This curious feature obliges the foreigner
to learn two parallel languages when studying this dialect, so
intimate and yet so distinct are the two. The difference between
them will be more apparent by quoting a sentence: “He
first performed that which was difficult, and afterward imitated
what was easier.” The corresponding words of the colloquial
are placed underneath the reading sounds.</p>

<p>The changes from one into the other are exceedingly various
both in sound and idiom. Thus, <i>bien chien</i>, ‘before one’s face,’
becomes <i>bin chan</i> when spoken; while in the phrase <i>cheng jit</i>,
‘a former day,’ the same word <i>chien</i> becomes <i>cheng</i> and not
<i>chan</i>; <i>bòé chu</i>, ‘pupil of the eye,’ becomes <i>ang a</i>; <i>sit hwan</i>,
‘to eat rice,’ becomes <i>chiah pui<sup>n</sup></i>. Their dialect, not less than
their trafficking spirit, point out the Amoy people wherever
they are met, and as they are usually found along the whole
coast and in the Archipelago, and are not understood except by
their provincial compatriots, they everywhere clan together and
form separate communities. Dr. Medhurst published a dictionary
of the Changchau dialect, in which the sounds of the characters
are given as they are read. Dr. C. Douglas has gathered a
great vocabulary of words and phrases used in the Amoy colloquial,
in which he has attempted to reduce everything to the
Romanized system of writing, and omitted all the characters.</p>

<p>The dialects of Fuhchau, Swatow, and Canton have been similarly
investigated by Protestant missionaries. Messrs. Maclay
and Baldwin have taken the former in hand, and their work
leaves very little to be desired for the elucidation of that speech.
Goddard’s vocabulary of the Swatow has no examples; and
Williams’ <cite>Tonic Dictionary</cite> of the Canton dialect gave no characters
with the examples. This deficiency was made up in
Lobscheid’s rearrangement of it under the radicals.</p>

<p>The extent to which the dialects are used has not been ascertained,
nor the degree of modification each undergoes in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
parts where it is spoken; for villagers within a few miles, although
able to understand each other perfectly, still give different
sounds to a few characters, and have a few local phrases,
enough to distinguish their several inhabitants, while towns one
or two hundred miles apart are still more unlike. For instance,
the citizen of Canton always says <i>shui</i> for water, and <i>tsz’</i> for
child, but the native of Macao says <i>sui</i> and <i>chí</i> for these two
words; and if his life depended upon his uttering them as they
are spoken in Canton, they would prove a shibboleth which he
could not possibly enunciate. Strong peculiarities of speech also
exist in the villages between Canton and Macao which are found
in neither of those places. Yet whatever sound they give to a
character it has the same tone, and a Chinese would be much
less surprised to hear water called <i>♯chwui</i>, than he would to
hear it called <i>♭shui</i> in the lower even tone, instead of its proper
ascending tone. The tones really approach vowels in their nature
more than mere musical inflections; and it is by their nice
discrimination, that the people are able to understand each other
with less difficulty than we might suppose amidst such a jargon
of vocables.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRONUNCIATION AND GRAMMAR.</div>

<p>This accurate discrimination in the vowel sounds, and comparative
indifference to consonants, which characterize the Chinese
spoken languages, has arisen, no doubt, from the monosyllabic
nature, and the constant though slight variations the names of
characters undergo from the traditionary mode in which they
must be learned. There being no integral sound in any character,
each and all of them are, of course, equally correct, <i>per se</i>;
but the various general and local dictionaries have each tended
somewhat to fix the pronunciation, just as books and education
have fixed the spelling of English words. Nor do the Chinese
more than other people learn to pronounce their mother tongue
from dictionaries, and the variations are consequently but partially
restrained by them. It may truly be said, that no two
Chinese speak all words alike, while yet, through means of the
universally understood character, the greatest mass of human
beings ever collected under one government are enabled to express
themselves without difficulty, and carry on all the business
and concerns of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span></p>

<p>The grammar of the Chinese language is unique, but those
writers who say it has no grammar at all must have overlooked
the prime signification of the word. There are in all languages
words which denote things, and others which signify qualities;
words which express actions done by one or many, already done,
doing or to be done; actions absolute, conditional, or ordered.
The circumstances of the doer and the subject of the action,
make prepositions necessary, as well as other connecting words.
Thus the principles of grammar exist in all intelligible speech,
though each may require different rules. These rules the Chinese
language possesses, and their right application, the proper
collocation of words, and use of particles, which supply the
place of inflection, constitute a difficult part in its acquisition.
It has no etymology, properly speaking, for neither the characters
nor their names undergo any change; whether used as
verbs or nouns, adjectives or particles, they remain the same.
The same word may be a noun, a verb, an adverb, or any part
of speech, nor can its character be certainly known till it is
placed in a sentence, when its meaning becomes definite. Its
grammar, therefore, is confined chiefly to its syntax and prosody.
This feature of the Chinese language is paralleled in English by
such words as <i>light</i>, used as a noun, adjective, and verb; <i>like</i>,
used as a verb, adjective, and adverb; <i>sheep</i> and <i>deer</i>, used both
in the singular and plural; <i>read</i>, used in the past, present, and
future tenses; and in all cases without undergoing any change.
But what is occasional and the exception in that tongue, becomes
the rule in Chinese; nor is there any more confusion in the last
than in the first.</p>

<p>A good summary of the principles of Chinese grammar is
given by Rémusat, who says that generally,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In every Chinese sentence, in which nothing is understood, the elements
of which it is composed are arranged in the following order: the subject, the
verb, the complement direct, and the complement indirect.</p>

<p>“Modifying expressions precede those to which they belong: thus, the adjective
is placed before the substantive, subject, or complement; the substantive
governed before the verb that governs it; the adverb before the verb, the proposition
incidental, circumstantial, or hypothetical, before the principal proposition,
to which it attaches itself by a conjunction expressed or understood.</p>

<p>“The relative position of words and phrases thus determined, supplies the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
place often of every other mark intended to denote their mutual dependence,
their character whether adjective or adverbial, positive, conditional, or circumstantial.</p>

<p>“If the subject be understood, it is because it is a personal pronoun, or
that it is expressed above, and that the same substantive that is omitted is
found in the preceding sentence, and in the same quality of subject, and not
in any other.</p>

<p>“If the verb be wanting, it is because it is the substantive verb, or some
other easily supplied, or one which has already found place in the preceding
sentences, with a subject or complement not the same.</p>

<p>“If several substantives follow each other, either they are in construction
with each other, or they form an enumeration, or they are synonyms which
explain and determine each other.</p>

<p>“If several verbs succeed each other, which are not synonyms and are not
employed as auxiliaries, the first ones should be taken as adverbs or verbal
nouns, the subjects of those which follow; or these latter as verbal nouns,
the complements of those which precede.”</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">PARTS OF SPEECH.</div>

<p>Chinese grammarians divide all words into <i>shih tsz’</i> and <i>hü
tsz’</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, essential words and particles. The former are subdivided
into <i>sz’ tsz’</i> and <i>hwoh tsz’</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, nouns and verbs; the latter
into initials or introductory words, conjunctions, exclamations,
finals, transitive particles, etc. They furnish examples under
each, and assist the student, with model books, in which the
principles of the language and all rhetorical terms are explained.
The number and variety of grammatical and philological works
prove that they have not neglected the elucidation and arrangement
of their mother tongue. The rules above cited are applicable
to the written language, and these treatises refer entirely
to that; the changes in the phraseology of the colloquial do
not affect its grammar, however, which is formed upon the same
rules.</p>

<p>Although the characters are, when isolated, somewhat indefinite,
there are many ways of limiting their meaning in sentences.
Nouns are often made by suffixing formative particles, as <i>nu kí</i>,
‘angry spirit,’ merely means <i>anger</i>; <i>í kí</i>, ‘righteous spirit,’ is
<i>rectitude</i>; <i>chin ’rh</i>, ‘needle child,’ is a needle, etc.; the suffix,
in these cases, simply materializing the word. Gender is formed
by distinctive particles, prefixed or suffixed by appropriate words
for each gender, or by denoting one gender always by a dissyllabic
compound; as <i>male</i>-being, for the masculine; horse-<i>sire</i>,
or horse-<i>mother</i>, for stallion or dam; <i>hero</i>, <i>heroine</i>, <i>emperor</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
<i>empress</i>, etc.; and lastly as <i>wang-hau</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, king-<i>queen</i>, for <i>queen</i>,
while <i>wang</i> alone means <i>king</i>. Number is formed by prefixing
a numeral, as <i>Yung</i>, <i>Tsin</i>, <i>two</i> men; by suffixing a formative,
<i>mun</i>, <i>tăng</i>, and others, as <i>jin-tăng</i>, man-<i>sort</i>, or men; <i>ta-mun</i>,
he-<i>s</i> or they; by repeating the word, as <i>jin-jin</i>, man-man
or <i>men</i>; <i>chu-chu</i>, place-place, or places, <i>i.e.</i>, everywhere; and
lastly, by the scope of the passage. The nominative, accusative,
and vocative cases are commonly known by their position; the
genitive, dative, and ablative are formed by appropriate prepositions,
expressed or understood. The vocative is common in
light reading and historical studies.</p>

<p>Adjectives precede nouns, by which position they are usually
determined. Comparisons are made in many ways. <i>Hau</i> is
<i>good</i>, <i>kăng hau</i> is <i>better</i>, and <i>chí hau</i> is <i>best</i>; <i>shih făn hau hau</i>
is <i>very good</i>; <i>hau hau tih</i> is <i>pretty good</i>, etc. The position of
an adjective determines its comparison, as <i>chang yih chih</i> means
<i>longer by one cubit</i>; <i>yih chih chang</i> is a <i>cubit long</i>. The comparison
of ideas is made by placing the two sentences parallel to
each other; for instance, “Entering the hills and seizing a tiger
is easy, opening the mouth and getting men to lean to is difficult,”
is the way of expressing the comparison, “It is easier to
seize a tiger in the hills, than to obtain the good offices of men.”
The proper use of antithesis and parallelism is considered one of
the highest attainments in composition. The numerals are thirteen
in number, with the addition of the character 零 <i>ling</i> to
denote a cipher. All amounts are written just as they are to
be read, as <i>yih peh sz’ shih san</i>, 一百四十三 <i>i.e.</i>, ‘one hundred
four tens three.’ They are here introduced, with their
pronunciation in three dialects.</p>

<p>The Chinese, like the ancient Greeks, enumerate only up to
a myriad, expressing sums higher than that by stating how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
myriads there are; the notation of 362,447,180 is three myriads,
six thousand, two hundred and forty-four myriads, seven thousand,
one hundred, and eighty. Pronouns are few in number,
and their use is avoided whenever the sense is clear without
them. The personal pronouns are three, <i>wo</i>, <i>ní</i>, and <i>ta</i>, but
other pronouns can all be readily expressed by adjectives, by
collocation, and by participial phrases. The classifiers sometimes
partake of the nature of adjective pronouns, but usually are mere
distributive or numerical adjectives.</p>

<p>Verbs, or “living characters,” constitute the most important
part of speech in the estimation of Chinese grammarians, and
the <i>shun tuh</i>, or easy flow of expression, in their use, is carefully
studied. The dissyllabic compounds, called <i>clam-shell words</i>,
are usually verbs, and are made in many ways; by uniting two
similar words, as <i>kwei-kien</i> (lit. peep-look), ‘to spy;’ by doubling
the verb, as <i>kien-kien</i>, meaning to look earnestly; by prefixing a
formative denoting action, as <i>ta shwui</i> (lit. strike sleep), ‘to sleep;’
by suffixing a modifying word, as <i>grasp-halt</i>, to grasp firmly;
<i>think-arise</i>, to cogitate, etc. No part of the study requires more
attention than the right selection of these formatives in both
nouns and verbs; perfection in the <i>shun tuh</i> and use of antitheses
is the result only of years of study.</p>

<p>The various accidents of voice, mood, tense, number, and person,
can all be expressed by corresponding particles, but the
genius of the language disfavors their frequent use. The passive
voice is formed by prefixing particles indicative of agency
before the active verb, as “The villain <i>received</i> my sword’s
<i>cutting</i>,” for “The villain was wounded by my sword.” The imperative,
potential, and subjunctive moods are formed by particles
or adjuncts, but the indicative and infinitive are not designated,
nor are the number and person of verbs usually distinguished.
The number of auxiliaries, particles, adjuncts, and
suffixes of various kinds, employed to express what in other
languages is denoted by inflections, is really very moderate; and
a nice discrimination exhibited in their use indicates the finished
scholar.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">DEFECTS IN THE CHINESE LANGUAGE.</div>

<p>The greatest defect in the Chinese language is the indistinct
manner in which time is expressed; not that there is any want
of terms to denote its varieties, but the terseness of expression
admired by Chinese writers leads them to discard every unessential
word, and especially those relating to time. This defect
is more noticed by the foreigner than the native, who has no
knowledge of the precision of time expressed by inflection in
other languages. Adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections
are not distinguished by native grammarians; the
former are classed with adjectives, and the others are collectively
called <i>hü tsz’</i>&mdash;‘empty words.’</p>

<p>No distinction is made between proper and common names,
and as every word can be employed as a name it becomes a
source of confusion to the translator; in some books a single
line drawn on the side of characters denotes the names of persons,
and a double line the names of places; important words are denoted
by commencing a new line with them, raised one or two
characters above the other columns, which answers to capitalizing
them. In most books an entire absence of all marks of
punctuation, and divisions into sentences and paragraphs, causes
needless doubt in the mind of the reader. The great convenience
experienced in European languages from the use of capital
letters, marks of punctuation, separation into sentences and paragraphs,
and the distinction of time, is more plainly seen when a
translation is to be made from languages like the Chinese and
Japanese, in which they are disregarded. A false taste prevents
them from using them; they admire a page of plain characters
so much that a student who should punctuate his essay would
run a risk of being ridiculed.</p>

<p>It is not easy yet to decide on the best way to adapt the
technical words in western science to the genius of this language.
The vast terminology in natural history, with the still greater
array of scientific names, need not be introduced into it, but can
remain in their original Latin and Greek, where Chinese scientists
can consult them. New compounds have already been
proposed for gases, metals, earths, acids, and other elementary
substances, in which the radical and primitive are chosen with
reference to their meanings, the latter being more complicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
than usual for this purpose. These will gradually get into use
as the sciences are studied, and their number will not be troublesomely
large.</p>

<p>There are several distinct styles of composition recognized.
The <i>ku wăn</i>, or the terse antithetic style of the ancient classics,
is considered as inimitable and unimprovable, and really possesses
the qualities of energy, vivacity, and brevity in a superior degree;
the <i>wăn chang</i>, or style of elevated composition, adopted
in essays, histories, and grave works; and the <i>siao shwoh</i>, or
colloquial style, used in stories.</p>

<p>If there are serious defects, this language also possesses some
striking beauties. The expressive nature of the characters, after
their component parts have become familiar, causes much of the
meaning of a sentence to pass instantly before the eye, while
the energy arising from the brevity attainable by the absence of
all inflections and partial use of particles, add a vigor to the
style that is hardly reached by any alphabetic language. Dr.
Morrison observes that “Chinese fine writing darts upon the
mind with a vivid flash, a force and a beauty, of which alphabetic
language is incapable.” It is also better fitted than any
other for becoming a universal medium of communication, and
has actually become so to a much greater extent than any other;
but the history of its diffusion, and the modifications it has undergone
among the five nations who use it, though presenting a
curious topic for philological inquiry, is one far too extensive to
be discussed here. So general a use of one written language,
however, affords some peculiar facilities for the diffusion of
knowledge by means of books as introductory to the general
elevation of the people using it, and their preparation for substituting
an alphabetic language for so laborious and unwieldy a
vehicle of thought, which it seems impossible to avoid as Christian
civilization and knowledge extend.</p>

<p>It is often asked, is the Chinese language hard to learn? The
preceding account of it shows that to become familiar with its
numerous characters, to be able to speak the delicately marked
tones of its short monosyllables, and to compose in it with perspicuity
and elegance, is the labor of years of close application.
To do so in Greek, Latin, English, or any settled tongue, is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
a toilsome task, and excepting the barren labor of remembering
so many different characters, it is not more so in Chinese than
in others. But knowledge sufficient to talk intelligibly, to write
perspicuously, and read with considerable ease, is not so herculean
a task as some suppose, though this degree is not to be attained
without much hard study. Moreover, dictionaries, manuals,
and translations are now available which materially diminish
the labor, and their number is constantly increasing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">METHOD OF STUDYING CHINESE.</div>

<p>The rules for studying it cannot be laid down so that they
will answer equally well for all persons. Some readily catch
the most delicate inflections of the voice, and imitate and remember
the words they hear; such persons soon learn to speak,
and can make themselves understood on common subjects with
merely the help of a vocabulary. Others prefer to sit down
with a teacher and learn to read, and for most persons this is
the best way to begin. At first, the principal labor should be
directed to the characters, reading them over with a teacher and
learning their form. Commence with the two hundred and
fourteen radicals, and commit them to memory, so that they
can be repeated and written in their order; then learn the primitives,
or at least become familiar with the names and meaning
of all the common ones. The aid this preliminary study gives
in remembering the formation of characters is worth all the
time it takes. Students make a mistake if they begin with the
Testament or a tract; they can learn more characters in the
same period, and lay a better foundation for acquiring others,
by commencing with the radicals and primitives. Meanwhile,
they will also be learning sounds and becoming familiar with
the tones, which should be carefully attended to as a particular
study from the living voice.</p>

<p>When these characters are learned, short sentences or reading
lessons selected from good <em>Chinese</em> authors, with a translation attached,
should be taken up and committed to memory. Phrases
may also be learned at the same time, for use in conversation;
an excellent way is to memorize one or two hundred common
words, and then practise putting them together in sentences. The
study of reading lessons and phrases, with practice in speaking
and writing them, will prepare the way for commencing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
study of the classics or other native authors. By the time the
student has reached this point he needs no further directions;
the path he wishes thenceforth to pursue can easily be marked
out by himself. It is not amiss here to remark that many persons
ardently desirous of fitting themselves soon for preaching
or talking to the people, weary their minds and hinder their
ultimate progress by too hard study at first upon the dry characters;
others come to look upon the written language as less
important so long as they can talk rapidly and well, but in the
end find that in this, as in every other living tongue, there is
no royal road which does not lead them through the grammar
and literature.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PIGEON-ENGLISH.</div>

<p>This sketch of the Chinese language would be incomplete
without a notice of the singular jargon which has grown up between
the natives and foreigners along the coast, called <i>pigeon-English</i>.
It has been so long in use as the medium of traffic
and household talk that it now bids fair to become an unwritten
patois, of which neither the Chinese nor the English
will own the parentage. The term <i>pigeon</i>, a corruption from
<i>business</i>, shows, in its transformation, some of the influences
which our words must undergo as they pass through the Chinese
characters. The foreigners who first settled at Canton
had no time nor facilities for learning the dialect, and the
traders with whom they bargained soon picked up more foreign
words than the former did native. The shopmen ere long
formed vocabularies of foreign words obtained from their customers,
and wrote the sounds as nearly as possible; these were
committed to memory and formed into sentences according to
the idioms of their own language, and disregarding all our inflections,
in which they had no instruction. Thus the two parties
gradually came to understand each other enough for all
practical ends; the foreigners were rather pleased to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
“broken China,” as it was not inaptly called, and habit soon
made it natural to a new-comer to talk it to the natives, and it
obviated all necessity for studying Chinese. The body of the
jargon is English, the few Chinese, Portuguese, and Malay
words therein imparting a raciness which, with the novelty of
the expressions, has of late attracted much attention to this
new language. Though apparently without any rules, the natives
are very liable to misapprehend what is said to them by
their masters or customers, because these rules are not followed,
and constant difficulty arises from mutual misunderstanding of
this sort. The widening study of Chinese is not likely to do
away with this droll lingo at the trade ports, and several attempts
have been made to render English pieces into it. On
the other hand, in California and elsewhere, the Chinese generally
succeed in learning the languages of their adopted countries
better than in talking <i>pigeon-English</i>, or the similar mongrel
vernacular spoken at Macao by the native-born Chinese.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the Chinese language is a passport to the
confidence of the people, and when foreigners generally learn it
the natives will begin to divest themselves of their prejudices
and contempt. As an inducement to study, the scholar and
the philanthropist have the prospect of benefiting and informing
through it vast numbers of their fellow-men, of imparting
to them what will elevate their minds, purify their hearts, instruct
their understandings, and strengthen their desire for
more knowledge; they have an opportunity of doing much to
counteract the tremendous evils of the opium trade by teaching
the Chinese the only sure grounds on which they can be restrained,
and at the same time of making them acquainted with
the discoveries in science, medicine, and arts among western
nations.</p>

<span class="smaller">CLASSICAL LITERATURE OF THE CHINESE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The literature contained in the language now briefly described
is very ample and discursive, but wanting in accuracy
and unenlivened by much variety or humor. The books of the
Chinese have formed and confirmed their national taste, which
consequently exhibits a tedious uniformity. The unbounded
admiration felt for the classics and their immaculate authors,
fostered by the examinations, has further tended to this result,
and caused these writings to become still more famous from
the unequalled influence they have exerted. It may be very
readily seen, then, with what especial interest the student of
Chinese sociology turns to an investigation of their letters,
the immense accumulation of forty centuries. Were its amount
and prominence the only features of their literature, these
would suffice to make necessary some study thereof; but in addition,
continued research may reveal some further qualities of
“eloquence and poetry, enriched by the beauty of a picturesque
language, preserving to imagination all its colors,” which will
substantiate the hearty expressions used by Rémusat when first
he entered upon a critical examination of its treasures.</p>

<p>In taking a survey of this literature, the <cite>Sz’ Ku Tsiuen Shu
Tsung-muh</cite>, or ‘Catalogue of all Books in the Four Libraries,’
will be the best guide, since it embraces the whole range of
letters, and affords a complete and succinct synopsis of the contents
of the best books in the language. It is comprised in one
hundred and twelve octavo volumes, and is of itself a valuable
work, especially to the foreigner. The books are arranged into
four divisions, viz., Classical, Historical, and Professional writings,
and Belles-lettres. This Catalogue contains about 3,440
separate titles, comprising upward of 78,000 books; besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
these, 6,764 other works, numbering 93,242 books, have been
described in other catalogues of the imperial collections. These
lists comprise the bulk of Chinese literature, except novels,
Buddhist translations, and recent publications.</p>

<p>The works in the first division are ranged under nine sections;
one is devoted to each of the five Classics (with a subsidiary
section upon these as a whole), one to the memoir on
Filial Duty, one to the Four Books, one to musical works, and
the ninth to treatises on education, dictionaries, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE YIH KING, OR BOOK OF CHANGES.</div>

<p>At the head of the ‘Five Classics’ (<cite>Wu King</cite>) is placed the
<cite>Yih King</cite>, or ‘Book of Changes,’ a work which if not&mdash;as it
has been repeatedly called&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiquissimus Sinarum liber</i>, can
be traced with tolerable accuracy to an origin three thousand
years ago. It ranks, according to Dr. Legge, third in antiquity
among the Chinese classics, or after the <cite>Shu</cite> and portions of
the <cite>Shí King</cite>; but if an unbounded veneration for enigmatical
wisdom supposed to lie concealed under mystic lines be any
just claim for importance, to this wondrous monument of literature
may easily be conceded the first place in the estimation of
Chinese scholars.</p>

<p>While following Dr. Legge in his recent exposition of this
classic,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> a clearer idea of its subject-matter can hardly be given
than by quoting his words stating that “the text may be briefly
represented as consisting of sixty-four short essays, enigmatically
and symbolically expressed, on important themes, mostly
of a moral, social, and political character, and based on the
same number of lineal figures, each made up of six lines, some
of which are whole and the others divided.” The evolution of
the eight diagrams from two original principles is ascribed to
Fuh-hí (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 3322), who is regarded as the founder of the nation,
though his history is, naturally enough, largely fabulous. From
the <i>Liang Í</i>, or ‘Two Principles’ (⚊) (⚋), were fashioned the
<i>Sz’ Siang</i>, or ‘Four Figures,’ by placing these over themselves
and each of them over the other, thus:</p>

<p class="center x-large">⚌ ⚍ ⚎ ⚏</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM.</div>

<p>The table furnishes us with the natural objects that these
figures are said to represent, the attributes which should seem
to be suggested by them, and which, with the application of the
eight points of the compass, together form the material for a
cabalistic logomancy peculiarly pleasing to Chinese habits of
thought. The trigrams furnish, moreover, the state and position,
at any given place or time, of the twofold division of the
one primordial <i>kí</i>, or ‘Air,’ called <i>Yang</i> and <i>Yin</i>, and have
thus become the source from whence the system of <i>Fung-shui</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
is derived and on whose changes it is founded. This substance
<i>kí</i> answers sufficiently closely to the animated air of the Grecian
philosopher Anaximenes; its divisions are a subtle and a coarse
principle which, acting and reacting upon each other, produce
four <i>siang</i>, or ‘forms,’ and these again combine into eight <i>kwa</i>,
or trigrams. Fuh-hí is thus said to have arranged the first four
of the <i>Pah Kwa</i> under the <i>Yang</i> (strong or hard) principle,
and the last four under the <i>Yin</i> (weak or soft) principle; the
former indicate vigor or authority, and it is their part to command,
while of the latter, representing feebleness or submission,
it is the part to obey.</p>

<p>It was probably Wăn Wang, King Wăn, chief of the principality
of Chau in 1185 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, who when thrown into prison by his
jealous suzerain Shau, the tyrant of Shang, arranged and multiplied
the trigrams&mdash;long before his time used for purposes
of divination&mdash;into the sixty-four hexagrams as they now occur
in the <cite>Yih King</cite>. His was a wholly different disposition, both
of names, attributes, and the compass points, from the original
trigrams of Fuh-hí; again, he added to them certain social relations
of father, mother, three sons, and three daughters, which
has ever since been found a convenient addition to the conjuring
apparatus of the work. “I like to think,” says Dr. Legge,
“of the lord of Chau, when incarcerated in Yu-lí, with the
sixty-four figures arranged before him. Each hexagram assumed
a mystic meaning and glowed with a deep significance.
He made it to tell him of the qualities of various objects of
nature, or of the principles of human society, or of the condition,
actual and possible, of the kingdom. He named the
figures each by a term descriptive of the idea with which he
had connected it in his mind, and then he proceeded to set that
idea forth, now with a note of exhortation, now with a note of
warning. It was an attempt to restrict the follies of divination
within the bounds of reason.... But all the work of
King Wăn in the <cite>Yih</cite> thus amounts to no more than sixty-four
short paragraphs. We do not know what led his son Tan to
enter into his work and complete it as he did. Tan was a
patriot, a hero, a legislator, and a philosopher. Perhaps he
took the lineal figures in hand as a tribute of filial duty. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
had been done for the whole hexagram he would do for each
line, and make it clear that all the six lines ‘bent one way their
precious influence,’ and blended their rays in the globe of light
which his father had made each figure give forth. But his
method strikes us as singular. Each line seemed to become
living, and suggested some phenomenon in nature, or some case
of human experience, from which the wisdom or folly, the
luckiness or unluckiness, indicated by it could be inferred. It
cannot be said that the duke carried out his plan in a way likely
to interest any one but a <i>hien shăng</i> who is a votary of divination
and admires the style of its oracles. According to our
notions, a framer of emblems should be a good deal of a poet;
but those of the <cite>Yih</cite> only make us think of a dryasdust. Out
of more than three hundred and fifty, the greater number are
only grotesque. We do not recover from the feeling of disappointment
till we remember that both father and son had to
write ‘according to the trick,’ after the manner of diviners, as
if this lineal augury had been their profession.”</p>

<p>Such is the text of the <cite>Yih</cite>. The words of King Wăn and
his son are followed by commentaries called the <cite>Shih Yih</cite>, or
‘Ten Wings.’ These are of a much later period than the text,
and are commonly ascribed to Confucius, though it is extremely
doubtful if the sage was author of more than the sentences introduced
by the oft-repeated formula, “The Master said,” occurring
in or concluding many chapters of the ‘Wings.’ Without
lingering over the varied contents of these appendices,
more than to point out that the fifth and sixth Wings (‘Appended
Sentences’), known as the ‘Great Treatise,’ contains for
the first time the character <i>Yih</i>, or ‘Change,’ it will be necessary,
before leaving this classic, to illustrate its curious nature
by means of a single quotation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS CHARACTER AND INFLUENCE.</div>

<p>An idea of the several commentaries, or ‘Wings,’ upon such a
passage may be gained from the following excerpts. First
comes the ‘Treatise on the Twan,’ or King Wăn’s paragraphs;
then the ‘Treatise on the Symbols,’ consisting of observations
on Duke Chau’s exposition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the <i>Second Wing</i>.&mdash;1. <i>Hien</i> is here used in the sense of <i>Kan</i>, meaning
[mutually] influencing.</p>

<p>2. The weak [trigram] above, and the strong one below; their two influences
moving and responding to each other, and thereby forming a union;
the repression [of the one] and the satisfaction [of the other]; [with their
relative position] where the male is placed below the female&mdash;all these things
convey the notion of ‘a free and successful course [on the fulfilment of the
conditions], while the advantage will depend on being firm and correct, as in
marrying a young lady, and there will be good fortune.’ ... etc., etc.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Wing.</i>&mdash;[The trigram representing] a mountain and above it that for
[the waters of] a marsh form <i>Hien</i>. The superior man, in accordance with
this, keeps his mind free from preoccupation, and open to receive [the influences
of] others.</p>

<p>1. ‘He moves his great toe’&mdash;his mind is set on what is beyond [himself].</p>

<p>2. Though ‘there would be evil, yet if he abide [quiet] in his place there
will be good fortune’&mdash;through compliance [with the circumstances of his
condition and place] there will be no injury.</p>

<p>3. ‘He moves his thighs’&mdash;he still does not [want to] rest in his place. His
will is set on ‘following others;’ what he holds in his grasp is low.</p>

<p>4. ‘Firm correctness will lead to good fortune, and prevent all occasion for
repentance’&mdash;there has not yet been any harm from [a selfish wish to] influence.
‘He is unsettled in his movements’&mdash;[his power to influence] is not
yet either brilliant or great.</p>

<p>5. ‘He [tries to] move the flesh along the spine above the heart’&mdash;his aim is
trivial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span></p>

<p>6. ‘He moves his jaws and tongue’&mdash;he [only] talks with loquacious mouth.</p>

<p><i>Sixth Wing</i> (‘Appended Sentences’).&mdash;Chapter I.&mdash;1. The eight trigrams
having been completed in their proper order, there were in each the [three]
emblematic lines. They were then multiplied by a process of addition till the
[six] component lines appeared.</p>

<p>2. The strong line and the weak push themselves each into the place of the
other, and hence the changes [of the diagrams] take place. The appended
explanations attach to every form of them its character [of good or ill], and
hence the movements [suggested by divination] are determined accordingly.</p>

<p>3. Good fortune and ill, occasion for repentance or regret, all arise from
these movements ... etc., etc.</p></div>

<p>The hundreds of fortune-tellers seen in the streets of Chinese
towns, whose answers to their perplexed customers are
more or less founded on these cabala, indicate their influence
among the illiterate; while among scholars, who have long
since conceded all divination to be vain, it is surprising to remark
the profound estimation in which these inane lines are
held as the consummation of all wisdom&mdash;the germ, even, of
all the truths which western science has brought to light!
Each hexagram is supposed to represent, at any given time, six
different phases of the primordial <i>kí</i>. “As all the good and
evil in the world,” observes McClatchie, “is attributed by the
Chinese philosophers to the purity or impurity of the animated
air from which the two-fold soul in man is formed, a certain
moral value attaches to each stroke, and the diviner prognosticates
accordingly that good or evil luck, as the case may be,
will result to the consulter of the oracle with regard to the matter
on which he seeks it. Nine is the number of Heaven, or
the undivided stroke, and six is the number of Earth, or the
divided stroke, and hence each stroke has a double designation.
The first stroke, if undivided, is designated ‘First-Nine,’ but if
divided it is designated ‘First-Six,’ and so on. The second
and fifth strokes in each diagram are important, being the centre
or medium strokes of their respective lesser diagrams. The
fifth stroke, however, is the most important in divination, as it
represents that portion of the air which is the especial throne
of the imperial power, and is the ‘undeflected due medium.’
Nothing but good luck can follow if the person divining with
the straws obtains this stroke. Tao, or the Divine Reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
which is the supreme soul of the whole Kosmos, animates the
air, pervading its six phases, and thus giving power to the diagrams
to make known future events to mankind.”</p>

<p>Of course anything and everything could be deduced from
such a fanciful groundwork, but the Chinese have taken up the
discussion in the most serious manner, and endeavored to find
the hidden meaning and evolutions of the universe from this
curious system. The diagrams have, moreover, supplied the
basis for many species of divination by shells, letters, etc., by
which means the mass of the people are deluded into the belief
of penetrating futurity, and still more wedded to their superstitions.
The continued influence of such a work as the <cite>Yih</cite> illustrates
the national <i>penchant</i> for laws and method, while
equally indicating the general indifference to empirical research
and the facts deduced from study of natural history. If, from
a philosophical standpoint, we consider the barrenness of its results,
there is little, indeed, to say for the <cite>Yih King</cite>, save concurrence
in Dr. Gustave Schlegel’s epithet, “a mechanical play
of idle abstractions;” nevertheless, this classic contains in its
whimsical dress of inscrutable strokes much of practical wisdom,
giving heed to which it is not hard to agree with Dr.
Legge in concluding that “the inculcation of such lessons cannot
have been without good effect in China during the long
course of its history.”<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SHU KING, OR BOOK OF RECORDS.</div>

<p>The second section of the Imperial Catalogue contains treatises
upon the <cite>Shu King</cite>, or ‘Book of Records.’ This classic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
first in importance as it is in age among the five <cite>King</cite>, consists
of a series of documents relating to the history of China from
the times of Yao down to King Hiang, of the Chau dynasty
(<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2357-627). Its earlier chapters were composed at periods
following the events of which they relate, but after the twenty-second
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> the <cite>Shu</cite> comes to us, though in a mutilated
condition, as the contemporary chronicle of proclamations, addresses,
and principles of the early sovereigns. Internal evidence
leads to the conclusion that Confucius acted chiefly as
editor of documents existing in his day; he probably wrote the
preface, but what alterations it received at his hand cannot now
be ascertained. When it left his care it contained eighty-one
documents in one hundred books, arranged under the five
dynasties of Yao, Shun, Hia, Shang, and Chau, the last one
coming down to within two hundred and twenty-one years of
his own birth. Most of these are lost, and others are doubted
by Chinese critics, so that now only forty-eight documents remain,
thirty of them belonging to the Chau, with the preface
ascribed to Confucius. He showed his estimate of their value
by calling the whole <cite>Shang Shu</cite>, or the ‘Highest Book,’ and we
may class their loss with that of other ancient works in Hebrew
or Greek literature. The <cite>Shu King</cite> now contains six different
kinds of state papers, viz., imperial ordinances, plans drawn up
by statesmen as guides for their sovereign, instructions prepared
for the guidance of the prince, imperial proclamations
and charges to the people, vows taken before Shangtí by the
monarch when going out to battle, and, lastly, mandates, announcements,
speeches, and canons issued to the ministers of
state.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>The morality of the <cite>Shu King</cite>, for a pagan work, is extremely
good; the principles of administration laid down in it, founded
on a regard to the welfare of the people, would, if carried out,
insure universal prosperity. The answer of Kaoyao to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span>
monarch Yu is expressive of a mild spirit: “Your virtue, O
Emperor, is faultless. You condescend to your ministers with
a liberal ease; you rule the multitude with a generous forbearance.
Your punishments do not extend to the criminal’s heirs,
but your rewards reach to after-generations. You pardon inadvertent
faults, however great, and punish deliberate crime,
however small. In cases of doubtful crimes you deal with them
lightly; of doubtful merit, you prefer the highest estimate.
Rather than put to death the guiltless, you will run the risk of
irregularity and laxity. This life-loving virtue has penetrated
the minds of the people, and this is why they do not render
themselves liable to be punished by your officers.”<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>In the counsels of Yu to Shun are many of the best maxims
of good government, both for rulers and ruled, which antiquity
has handed down in any country. The following are among
them: “Yih said, Alas! Be cautious. Admonish yourself to
caution when there seems to be no reason for anxiety. Do
not fail in due attention to laws and ordinances. Do not find
enjoyment in indulgent ease. Do not go to excess in pleasure.
Employ men of worth without intermediaries. Put away evil
advisers, nor try to carry out doubtful plans. Study that all
your purposes may be according to reason. Do not seek the
people’s praises by going against reason, nor oppose the people
to follow your own desires. Be neither idle nor wayward, and
even foreign tribes will come under your sway.”</p>

<p>The <cite>Shu King</cite> contains the seeds of all things that are valuable
in the estimation of the Chinese; it is at once the foundation
of their political system, their history, and their religious
rites, the basis of their tactics, music, and astronomy. Some
have thought that the knowledge of the true God under the
appellation of Shangtí is not obscurely intimated in it, and the
precepts for governing a country, scattered through its dialogues
and proclamations, do their writers credit, however little they
may have been followed in practice. Its astronomy has attracted
much investigation, but whether the remarks of the
commentators are to be ascribed to the times in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
themselves flourished, or to the knowledge they had of the ancient
state of the science, is doubtful. The careful and candid
discussions by Legge in the introduction to his translation furnish
most satisfactory conclusions as to the origin, value, and
condition of this venerable relic of ancient China. For his
scholarly edition of the <cite>Classics</cite> he has already earned the
hearty thanks of every student of Chinese literature.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SHÍ KING, OR BOOK OF ODES.</div>

<p>The third of the classics, the <cite>Shí King</cite>, or ‘Book of Odes,’
is ranked together with the two preceding, while its influence
upon the national mind has been equally great; a list of commentators
upon this work fills the third section of the Catalogue.
These poetical relics are arranged into four parts: The <cite>Kwoh
Fung</cite>, or ‘National Airs,’ numbering one hundred and fifty-nine,
from fifteen feudal States; the <cite>Siao Ya</cite>, or ‘Lesser Eulogiums,’
numbering eighty, and arranged under eight decades; the <cite>Ta
Ya</cite>, or ‘Greater Eulogiums,’ numbering thirty-one, under three
decades (both of these were designed to be sung on solemn occasions
at the royal court); and the <cite>Sung</cite>, or ‘Sacrificial Odes,’
numbering forty-one chants connected with the ancestral worship
of the rulers of Chau, Lu, and Shang. Out of a total number
of three hundred and eleven now extant, six have only their
titles preserved, while to a major part of the others native
scholars give many various readings.</p>

<p>In the preface to his careful translation Dr. Legge has collected
all the important information concerning the age, origin,
and purpose of these odes, as furnished by native commentators,
whose theory is that “it was the duty of the kings to make
themselves acquainted with all the odes and songs current in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
the different States, and to judge from them of the character of
the rule exercised by their several princes, so that they might
minister praise or blame, reward or punishment accordingly.”
These odes and songs seem to have been gathered by Wăn
Wang and Duke Chau at the beginning of the Chau dynasty
(<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1120), some of them at the capital, others from the feudal
rulers in the course of royal progresses through the land, the
royal music-master getting copies from the music-masters of the
princes. The whole were then arranged, set to music, too, it
may be, and deposited for use and reference in the national
archives, as well as distributed among the feudatories. Their
ages are uncertain, but probably do not antedate <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1719
nor come after 585, or about thirty years before Confucius.
Their number was not improbably at first fully up to the three
thousand mentioned by the biographers of Confucius, but long
before the sage appeared disasters of one kind and another had
reduced them to nearly their present condition. What we have
is, therefore, but a fragment of various collections made in the
early reigns of the Chau sovereigns, which received, perhaps,
larger subsequent additions than were preserved to the time of
Confucius. He probably took them as they existed in his day,
and feeling, possibly, like George Herbert, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“A verse may finde him, who a sermon flies,</div>
      <div class="verse">And turn delight into a sacrifice,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>did everything he could to extend their adoption among his
countrymen. It is difficult to estimate the power they have
exerted over the subsequent generations of Chinese scholars&mdash;nor
has their influence ever tended to debase their morals, if it
has not exalted their imagination. They have escaped the
looseness of Moschus, Ovid, or Juvenal, if they have not attained
the grandeur of Homer or the sweetness of Virgil and
Pindar. There is nothing of an epic character in them&mdash;nor
even a lengthened narrative&mdash;and little of human passions in
their strong development. The metaphors and illustrations are
often quaint, sometimes puerile, and occasionally ridiculous.
Their acknowledged antiquity, their religious character, and
their illustration of early Chinese customs and feelings form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
their principal claims to our notice and appreciative study.
M. Ed. Biot, of Paris, was the first European scholar who studied
them carefully in this aspect, and his articles in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal
Asiatique</cite> for 1843 are models of analytic criticism and synthetic
compilation, enabling one, as he says, “to contemplate
at his ease the spectacle of the primitive manners of society in
the early age of China, so different from what was then found
in Europe and Western Asia.”</p>

<p>The last two stanzas indicate the comparative estimate, in
ancient days, of boys and girls born into a family; and this estimate,
still maintained, has been in a great degree upheld by
this authority. Another ode in the ‘Greater Eulogies’ (Book

owing to the interference of women and eunuchs in the govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span>ment.
Two stanzas only are quoted, which are supposed to

<p>There are, however, numerous stanzas among the odes in the
‘National Airs’ which show their fairer side and go far to neutralize
these, giving the same contrasts in female character
which were portrayed by King Solomon during the same age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VERSIFICATION OF THE SHÍ KING.</div>

<p>The versification in a monosyllabic language appears very
tame to those who are only familiar with the lively and varied
rhythms of western tongues; but the Chinese express more
vivacity and cadence in their ballads and ditties when sung than
one would infer from these ancient relics when transliterated
in our letters. As the young lad has usually committed all the
three hundred and five odes to memory before he enters the
Examination Hall, their influence on the matter and manner of
his own future poetical attempts can hardly be exaggerated. It
is shown throughout the thousands of volumes enumerated in
the fourth division of the Imperial Catalogue. Most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
<cite>Shí King</cite> is written in tetrametres, and nothing can be more
simple. They have been most unfortunately likened to the
Hebrew Psalms by some of the early missionaries, but neither
in manner nor matter is the comparison a happy one. One point
of verbal resemblance is noticed by Dr. Legge between the first
ode in Part III. and the one hundred and twenty-first psalm,
where the last line of a stanza is generally repeated in the first
line of the next, a feature something like the repetitions in <cite>Hiawatha</cite>.
The rhymes and tones both form an essential part of
Chinese poetry, one which can only be imperfectly represented
in our language. The following furnishes an example of the
general style, to which a literal rendering is subjoined:</p>

<p>The highest range of thought in the odes is contained in
Part IV., but the whole collection is worthy of perusal, and
through the labors of Dr. Legge has been made more accessible
than it was ever before. The amount of native literature extant,
illustrative, critical, and philological, referring to the
<cite>Book of Odes</cite><a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> is not so large as that on the <cite>Yih King</cite>; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
fifty-five works quoted in his preface<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> contain enough to indicate
their industry and acumen. These works will elevate the
character of Chinese scholarship in the opinion of those foreigners
who remember the disadvantages of its isolation from
the literature of other lands, and the difficulties of a language
which rendered that literature inaccessible.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE THREE RITUALS.</div>

<p>The fourth section in the Catalogue contains the Rituals and
a list of their editions and commentators, but only one of the
three is numbered among the <cite>King</cite> and used as a text-book at
the public examinations. This is the <cite>Lí Kí</cite>, or ‘Book of Rites,’
the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémorial des Rites</cite>, as M. Callery calls it in his translation,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
and one of the works which has done so much to mold
and maintain Chinese character and institutions. It is not superior
in any respect to the <cite>Chau Lí</cite> and the <cite>Í Lí</cite>, but owes its
influence to its position. They were all the particular objects
of Tsin Chí Hwangtí’s ire in his efforts to destroy every ancient
literary production in his kingdom; the present texts
were recovered from their hiding-places about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 135. The
<cite>Chau Lí</cite>, or ‘Ritual of Chau,’ is regarded as the work of Duke
Chau (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1130), who gives the detail of the various offices established
under the new dynasty, in which he bore so prominent
a part. The sections containing the divisions of the administrative
part of the Chinese government of that day have
furnished the types for the six boards of the present day and
their subdivisions. So far as we now know, no nation then existing
could show so methodical and effective a system of national
polity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span></p>
<p>The <cite>Í Lí</cite> is a smaller work, treating of family affairs, and
as its name, ‘Decorum Ritual,’ indicates, contains directions
for domestic life, as the other does for state matters. That is
in forty-four sections and this is in seven, and both are now
accepted as among the most ancient works extant. The former
was translated by Ed. Biot,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and remains a monument of his
scholarship and research.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LÍ KÍ, OR BOOK OF RITES.</div>

<p>The <cite>Lí Kí</cite> owes its position among the classics to the belief
that Confucius here gives his views on government and manners,
although these chapters are not regarded as the same in
their integrity as those said to have been found in the walls of his
house, and brought to light in the second century B.C. by Kao
Tang of Lu, under the name of <cite>Sz’ Lí</cite>, or the ‘Scholar’s Ritual.’
In the next century Tai Teh collected all the existing
documents relating to the ancient rituals in two hundred and
fourteen sections, only a portion of which were then held to
have emanated from the sage and recorded by his pupils. His
work, in eighty-five sections, is called <cite>Ta Tai Lí</cite>, or the
‘Senior Tai’s Ritual,’ to distinguish it from the <cite>Siao Tai
Lí</cite>, or the ‘Junior Tai’s Ritual,’ a work in forty-nine sections,
by his nephew, Tai Shing. This is the work now known as
the <cite>Lí Kí</cite>, M. Callery’s translation of which contains the
authorized text of Kanghí according to Fan Tsz’-tăng, in
thirty-six sections, with many notes. His translation is wearisome
reading from the multitude of parentheses interjected
into the text, distracting the attention and weakening its continuity.</p>

<p>Those who have read Abbé Huc’s entertaining remarks on
the Rites in China will find in these three works the reason and
application of their details. In explanation of their importance,
M. Callery shows in a few words what a wide field they
cover: “Ceremony epitomizes the entire Chinese mind; and,
in my opinion, the <cite>Lí Kí</cite> is <i>per se</i> the most exact and complete
monograph that China has been able to give of itself to other
nations. Its affections, if it has any, are satisfied by cere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>mony;
its duties are fulfilled by ceremony; its virtues and
vices are referred to ceremony; the natural relations of created
beings essentially link themselves in ceremonial&mdash;in a word,
to that people ceremonial is man as a moral, political, and religious
being in his multiplied relations with family, country,
society, morality, and religion.” This explanation shows, too,
how meagre a rendering <i>ceremony</i> is for the Chinese idea of <i>lí</i>,
for it includes not only the external conduct, but involves the
right principles from which all true etiquette and politeness
spring. The state religion, the government of a family, and
the rules of society are all founded on the true <i>lí</i>, or relations
of things. Reference has already been made to this profoundly
esteemed work (p. <a href="#Page_520">520</a>), and one or two more extracts will suffice
to exhibit its spirit and style, singular in its object and
scope among all the bequests of antiquity.</p>


<h3><i>Affection between father and son.</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the Domestic Rules it is said, “Men in serving their parents, at the first
cock-crowing, must all wash their hands; rinse their mouth; comb their
hair; bind it together with a net; fasten it with a bodkin, forming it into a
tuft; brush off the dust; put on the hat, tying the strings, ornamented with
tassels; also the waistcoat, frock, and girdle, with the note-sticks placed in it,
and the indispensables attached on the right and left; bind on the greaves;
and put on the shoes, tying up the strings. Wives must serve their husband’s
father and mother as their own; at the first cock-crowing, they must wash
their hands; rinse their mouth; comb their hair; bind it together with a net;
fasten it with a bodkin, forming it into a tuft; put on their frocks and girdles,
with the indispensables attached on the right and left; fasten on their bags of
perfumery; put on and tie up their shoes. Then go to the chamber of their
father and mother, and father-in-law and mother-in-law, and having entered,
in a low and placid tone they must inquire whether their dress is too warm or
too cool; if the parents have pain or itching, themselves must respectfully
press or rub [the part affected]; and if they enter or leave the room, themselves
either going before or following, must respectfully support them. In
bringing the apparatus for washing, the younger must present the bowl; the
elder the water, begging them to pour it and wash; and after they have
washed, hand them the towel. In asking and respectfully presenting what
they wish to eat, they must cheer them by their mild manner; and must wait
till their father and mother, and father-in-law and mother-in-law have eaten,
and then retire. Boys and girls, who have not arrived at the age of manhood
and womanhood, at the first cock-crowing must wash their hands; rinse their
mouth; comb their hair; bind it together with a net; and form it into a tuft;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
brush off the dust; tie on their bags, having them well supplied with perfumery;
then hasten at early dawn to see their parents, and inquire if they have
eaten and drunk; if they have, they must immediately retire; but if not,
they must assist their superiors in seeing that everything is duly made ready.”</p></div>


<h3><i>Of reproving parents.</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When his parents are in error, the son with a humble spirit, pleasing
countenance, and gentle tone, must point it out to them. If they do not receive
his reproof, he must strive more and more to be dutiful and respectful
toward them till they are pleased, and then he must again point out their
error. But if he does not succeed in pleasing them, it is better that he should
continue to reiterate reproof, than permit them to do injury to the whole
department, district, village, or neighborhood. And if the parents, irritated
and displeased, chastise their son till the blood flows from him, even then he
must not dare to harbor the least resentment; but, on the contrary, should
treat them with increased respect and dutifulness.”</p></div>


<h3><i>Respect to be paid parents in one’s conduct.</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Although your father and mother are dead, if you propose to yourself any
good work, only reflect how it will make their names illustrious, and your
purpose will be fixed. So if you propose to do what is not good, only consider
how it will disgrace the names of your father and mother, and you will desist
from your purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p></div>

<p>These extracts show something of the molding principles
which operate on Chinese youth from earliest years, and the
scope given in his education to filial piety. From conning such
precepts the lad is imbued with a respect for his parents that
finally becomes intensified into a religious sentiment, and forms,
as he increases in age, his only creed&mdash;the worship of ancestors.
His seniors, on the other hand, have but to point to the text-books
before him as authority for all things they exact, and as
being the only possible source of those virtues that conduct to
happiness. The position of females, too, has remained, under
these dogmas, much the same for hundreds of years. Nor is it
difficult to account for the influence which they have had.
Those who were most aware of their excellence, and had had
some experience in the tortuous dealings of the human heart,
as husbands, fathers, mothers, officers, and seniors, were those
who had the power to enforce obedience upon wives, children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
daughters, subjects, and juniors, as well as teach it to them.
These must wait till increasing years brought about their turn
to fill the upper rank in the social system, by which time habit
would lead them to exercise their sway over the rising generation
in the same manner. Thus it would be perpetuated, for
the man could not depart from the way his childhood was
trained; had the results been more disastrous, it would have
been easy for us to explain why, amid the ignorance, craft, ambition,
and discontent found in a populous, uneducated, pagan
country, such formal rules had failed of benefiting society to
any lasting extent. We must look higher for this result, and
acknowledge the degree of wholesome restraint upon the passions
of the Chinese which the Author of whatever is good in
these tenets has seen fit to confer upon them in order to the preservation
of society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHUN TSIU, OR SPRING AND AUTUMN RECORD.</div>

<p>The fifth section contains the <cite>Chun Tsiu</cite>, or ‘Spring and
Autumn Record,’ and its literature. This is the only one of
the <cite>King</cite> attributed to Confucius, though whether we have in
the <cite>Record</cite>, as it now exists, a genuine compilation of the sage,
does not appear to be beyond doubt. His object being to construct
a narrative of events in continuation of the <cite>Shu King</cite>,
he, with assistance from his pupils, drew up a history of his
own country, extending from the reign of Ping Wang to about
the period of his birth (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 722 to 480). Inasmuch as the
author of this chronicle confined himself to the relation of such
facts as he deemed worthy to be recorded, and was not above
altering or concealing such details as in his private judgment
appeared unworthy of the princes of his dynasty, this history
cannot be regarded as exactly in conformity with modern notions
of what is desirable in works of this class. That Confucius
wished to leave behind him a lasting monument to his own
name, as well as a narration of events, we gather from more
than one of his utterances: “The superior man is distressed
lest his name should not be honorably mentioned after death.
My principles do not make way in the world; how shall I make
myself known to future ages?” In order, therefore, to insure
the preservation of his <i>chef d’œuvre</i> to all time, he combines
with the annals certain censures and righteous decisions which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
should render it at once a history and a text-book of moral lessons;
and in giving the book to his disciples, “It is by the
<cite>Chun Tsiu</cite>,” he said, “that after-ages will know me, and also
by it that they will condemn me.”</p>

<p>The title, “Spring and Autumn,” is understood by many Chinese
scholars to be a term for chronological annals; in this case
the name being explained “because their commendations are
life-giving like spring, and their censures life-withering like
autumn,” or, as we find in the <cite>Trimetrical Classic</cite>, “which by
praise and blame separates the good and bad.”<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> A closer inspection
of the <cite>Chun Tsiu</cite> is sure to prove disappointing; spite
of the glowing accounts of Mencius and its great reputation,
this history is simply a bald record of incidents whose entire
contents afford barely an hour’s reading. “Instead of a history
of events,” writes Dr. Legge, “woven artistically together,
we find a congeries of the briefest possible intimations of matters
in which the court and State of Lu were more or less concerned,
extending over two hundred and forty-two years, without
the slightest tincture of literary ability in the composition,
or the slightest indication of judicial opinion on the part of the
writer. The paragraphs are always brief. Each one is designed
to commemorate a fact; but whether that fact be a display of
virtue calculated to command our admiration, or a deed of
atrocity fitted to awaken our disgust, it can hardly be said that
there is anything in the language to convey to us the shadow of
an idea of the author’s feelings about it. The notices&mdash;for we
cannot call them narratives&mdash;are absolutely unimpassioned. A
base murder and a shining act of heroism are chronicled just
as the eclipses of the sun are chronicled. So and so took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
place; that is all. No details are given; no judgment is expressed.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS COMMENTARIES.</div>

<p>So imperturbable a recital could hardly have been saved from
extinction even by the great reputation of the sage, had it not
been for the amplification of Tso, a younger contemporary or
follower of Confucius, who filled up the meagre sentences and
added both flesh and life to the skeleton. It is possible that
the enthusiastic praises of Mencius are due to the fact that he
associated the text and commentary as one work. The Chuen
of Tso has indeed always been regarded as foremost among the
secondary classics; nor is it too much, considering his terse yet
vivid and pictorial style, to call its author, as does Dr. Legge,
“the Froissart of China.”<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> In addition to his purpose of explaining
the text of the <cite>Chun Tsiu</cite>, Tso’s secondary object was
to give a general view of the history of China during the period
embraced by that record; unless he had put his living tableaux
into the framework of his master, there is grave reason to fear
that many most important details relating to the sixth and seventh
centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> would have been forever lost. Two other
early commentaries, those of Kung Yang and Kuh Liang, dating
from about the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, occupy a high position
in the estimation of Chinese scholars as illustrative of the original
chronicle. They do not compare with the <cite>Tso Chuen</cite>
either in interest or in authority, though it may be said that a
study of the <cite>Chun Tsiu</cite> can hardly be made unless attended
with a careful perusal of their contents. It will not be without
interest to give an example of the <cite>Record</cite>, followed with elucidations
of the text by these three annotators. The second year
of Duke Hí of Lu (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 657) runs as follows:</p>

an officer of Kiang, and an officer of Hwang, made a covenant in Kwan.</p>

<p>5. In winter, in the tenth month, there was no rain.</p>

<p>6. A body of men from Tsu made an incursion into Ching.</p></div>

<p>Upon the third entry for this year the <cite>Tso Chuen</cite> enlarges:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Seun Seih, of Tsin, requested leave from the marquis to take his team of
Kiuh horses and his <i>peih</i> of Chui-keih jade, and with them borrow a way from
Yu to march through it and attack Kwoh. “They are the things I hold most
precious,” said the marquis. Seih replied, “But if you get a way through
Yu, it is but like placing them in a treasury outside the State for a time.”
“There is Kung Che-kí in Yu,” objected the duke. “Kung Che-kí,” returned
the other, “is a weak man, and incapable of remonstrating vigorously. And,
moreover, from his youth up he has always been with the Duke of Yu, who is
so familiar with him that though he should remonstrate the duke will not
listen to him.” The marquis accordingly sent Seun Seih to borrow a way
through Yu with this message: “Formerly Kí, against right and reason, entered
your State from Tien-ling, and attacked the three gates of Ming. It
suffered for so doing, all through your grace. Now Kwoh, against right and
reason, has been keeping guards about the travellers’ lodges, to make incursions
from them into my southern borders, and I venture to beg a right of way
from you to ask an account of its offence.” The Duke of Yu granted the request,
and even asked to take the lead in invading Kwoh. Kung Che-kí
remonstrated with him, but in vain; and he raised his army for the enterprise.
In summer, Lí Kih and Seun Seih brought on the army of Tsin, made
a junction with that of Yu, and invaded Kwoh, when they extinguished Hia-yang.
The army of Yu is mentioned first, because of the bribes which the
duke accepted.</p></div>

<p>The commentary of Kung Yang says on the same paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yu was a small State; why is it that it is here made to take precedence of
a great one? To make Yu take the lead in the wickedness.</p>

<p>Why is Yu made to take the lead in the wickedness? Yu received the
bribes with which those [who were going to] extinguish the State [of Kwoh]
borrowed a way through it, and thus brought on its own ruin.</p>

<p>How did it receive [those] bribes? Duke Hien [of Tsin] gave audience to
his great officers, and asked them why it was that he had lain all night without
sleeping. One of them advanced and said, “Was it because you did not feel
at ease [in your mind]? or was it because your [proper] bedfellow was not by
your side?” The duke gave no answer, and then Seun Seih came forward
and said, “Was it because Yu and Kwoh were appearing to you?” The duke
motioned to him to come [more] forward, and then went with him into an inner
apartment to take counsel. “I wish,” said he, “to attack Kwoh, but Yu
will go to its relief, and if I attack Yu Kwoh will succor it; what is to be
done? I wish to consider the case with you.” Seun Seih replied, “If you
will use my counsel, you shall take Kwoh to-day and Yu to-morrow; why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
should your lordship be troubled?” “How is this to be accomplished?”
asked the duke. “Please let [me go to] Yu,” said the other, “with your team
of Kiuh horses and your white <i>peih</i> of Chui-keih, and you are sure to get
[what you want]. It will only be taking your valuable [<i>peih</i>] from your inner
treasury and depositing it in an outer one; your lordship will lose nothing
by it.” The duke said, “Yes; but Kung Che-kí is there. What are
we to do with him?” Seun Seih replied, “Kung Che-kí is indeed knowing;
but the Duke of Yu is covetous, and fond of valuable curios; he is sure
not to follow his minister’s advice. I beg you, considering everything, to let
me go.” ... etc., etc.</p></div>

<p>The following, as a brief sample of the Kuh Liang commentary,
takes up the narrative where we have broken off. There
is so much that is similar in these two latter exegeses as to lead
to the belief that they were composed with reference to each
other.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On this Duke Hien sought [in the way proposed] for a passage [through
Yu] to invade Kwoh. Kung Che-kí remonstrated, saying, “The words of the
envoy of Tsin are humble, but his offerings are great; the matter is sure not
to be advantageous to Yu.” The Duke of Yu, however, would not listen to
him, but received the offerings and granted the passage through the State.
Kung Che-kí remonstrated [again], suggesting that the case was like that in
the saying about the lips being gone and the teeth becoming cold; after which
he fled with his wife and children to Tsao.</p>

<p>Duke Hien then destroyed Kwoh, and in the fifth year [of our Duke Hí] he
dealt in the same way with Yu. Seun Seih then had the horses led forward,
while he carried the <i>peih</i> in his hand, and said: “The <i>peih</i> is just as it was,
but the horses’ teeth are grown longer!”<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p></div>

<p>Meagre as are the items of the text, they show, together with
its copious commentaries, the methodical care of the early Chinese
in preserving their ancient records. The hints which these
and other books give of their intellectual activity during the
eight centuries before Christ, naturally compel a higher estimate
of their culture than we have hitherto allowed them.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sixth section of the Catalogue has already been noticed
as comprising the literature of the <cite>Hiao King</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span></p>

<p>The seventh section contains a list of works written to elucidate
the Five Classics as a whole, and if their character for
originality of thought, variety of research, extent of illustration,
and explanation of obscurities was comparable to their size and
numbers, no books in any language could boast of the aids possessed
by the <cite>Wu King</cite> for their right comprehension. Of
these commentators, Chu Hí of Kiangsí, who lived during the
Sung dynasty, has so greatly exceeded all others in illustrating
and expounding them, that his explanations are now considered
of almost equal authority with the text, and are always given
to the beginner to assist him in ascertaining its true meaning.</p>

<p>The eighth section of the Catalogue comprises memoirs and
comments upon the <cite>Sz’ Shu</cite>, or ‘Four Books,’ which have been
nearly as influential in forming Chinese mind as the <cite>Wu King</cite>.
They are by different authors, and since their publication have
perhaps undergone a few alterations and interpolations, but the
changes either in these or the Five Classics cannot be very
numerous or great, since the large body of disciples who followed
Confucius, and had copies of his writings, would carefully
preserve uncorrupt those which he edited, and hand down
unimpaired those which contained his sayings. None of the
Four Books were actually written by Confucius himself, but
three of them are considered to be a digest of his sentiments;
they were arranged in their present form by the brothers Ching,
who flourished about eight centuries ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREAT LEARNING AND JUST MEDIUM.</div>

<p>The first of the Four Books is the <cite>Ta Hioh</cite>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Superior’
or ‘Great Learning,’ which originally formed one chapter of
the <cite>Book of Rites</cite>. It is now divided into eleven chapters,
only the first of which is ascribed to the sage, the remainder
forming the comment upon them; the whole does not contain
two thousand words. The argument of the <cite>Ta Hioh</cite> is briefly
summed up in four heads, “the improvement of one’s self, the
regulation of a family, the government of a state, and the rule
of an empire.” In the first chapter this idea is thus developed
in a circle peculiarly Chinese:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ancients, who wished to illustrate renovating virtue throughout the
Empire, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their
states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they
first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to
be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they
first extended their knowledge to the utmost. Such extension of knowledge
lay in the investigation of things. Things being investigated, knowledge became
complete: knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere: their
thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified: their hearts being
rectified, their persons were cultivated: their persons being cultivated, their
families were regulated: families being regulated, states were rightly governed;
and states being rightly governed, the Empire was made tranquil.</p>

<p>From the Son of Heaven to the man of the people, all must consider the
cultivation of the person to be the foundation.</p></div>

<p>The subsequent chapters mainly consist of the terse sayings
of ancient kings and authors gathered and arranged by Tsăng
and afterward by Chu Hí, designed to illustrate and enforce
the teachings of Confucius contained in the first. One quotation
only can be given from Chapter X.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the Declaration of [the Duke of] Tsin, it is said: “Let me have but one
minister plain and sincere, not pretending to other abilities, but with a simple
upright mind; and possessed of generosity, regarding the talents of others as
though he possessed them himself, and where he finds accomplished and perspicacious
men, loving them in his heart more than his mouth expresses, and
really showing himself able to avail himself of them; such a minister will be
able to preserve my descendants and the Black-haired people, and benefits to
the kingdom might well be looked for. But if it be, when he finds men of
ability, he is jealous and hateful to them; and when he meets accomplished
and perspicacious men, he opposes them and will not allow their advancement,
showing that he is really not able to avail himself of them; such a
minister will not be able to protect my descendants and the Black-haired
people. May he not even be pronounced dangerous?”</p></div>

<p>It will be willingly allowed, when reading these extracts,
that, destitute as they were of the high sanctions and animating
hopes and promises of the Word of God, these Chinese
moralists began at the right place in their endeavors to reform
and benefit their countrymen, and that they did not fully succeed
was owing to causes beyond their reforming power.</p>

<p>The second of the Four Books is called <cite>Chung Yung</cite>, or the
‘Just Medium,’ and is, in some respects, the most elaborate
treatise in the series. It was composed by Kung Kih, the
grandson of Confucius (better known by his style <span class="smcap">Tsz’-sz’</span>),
about ninety years after the sage’s death. It once also formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
part of the <cite>Lí Kí</cite>, from which it, as well as the <cite>Ta Hioh</cite>,
were taken out by Chu Hí to make two of the <cite>Sz’ Shu</cite>. It
has thirty-three chapters, and has been the subject of numerous
comments. The great purpose of the author is to illustrate the
nature of human virtue, and to exhibit its conduct in the
actions of an ideal <i>kiun tsz’</i>, or ‘princely man’ of immaculate
propriety, who always demeans himself correctly, without going
to extremes. He carries out the advice of Hesiod:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“Let every action prove a mean confess’d;</div>
      <div class="verse">A moderation is, in all, the best.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>True virtue consists in never going to extremes, though it does
not appear that by this the sage meant to repress active benevolence
on the one hand, or encourage selfish stolidity on the
other. <i>Ching</i>, or uprightness, is said to be the basis of all
things; and <i>ho</i>, harmony, the all-pervading principle of the
universe; “extend uprightness and harmony to the utmost,
and heaven and earth will be at rest, and all things be produced
and nourished according to their nature.” The general character
of the work is monotonous, but relieved with some animated
passages, among which the description of the <i>kiun tsz’</i>, or
princely man, is one. “The princely man, in dealing with
others, does not descend to anything low or improper. How unbending
his valor! He stands in the middle, and leans not to
either side. The princely man enters into no situation where
he is not himself. If he holds a high situation, he does not
treat with contempt those below him; if he occupies an inferior
station, he uses no mean arts to gain the favor of his superiors.
He corrects himself and blames not others; he feels no dissatisfaction.
On the one hand, he murmurs not at Heaven; nor,
on the other, does he feel resentment toward man. Hence, the
superior man dwells at ease, entirely waiting the will of
Heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SAGE, OR PRINCELY MAN.</div>

<p>Chinese moralists divide mankind into three classes, on these
principles: “Men of the highest order, as sages, worthies, philanthropists,
and heroes, are good without instruction; men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
the middling classes are so after instruction, such as husbandmen,
physicians, astrologers, soldiers, etc., while those of the
lowest are bad in spite of instruction, as play-actors, pettifoggers,
slaves, swindlers, etc.” The first are <i>shing</i>, or sages;
the second are <i>hien</i>, or worthies; the last are <i>yu</i>, or worthless.
Sir John Davis notices the similarity of this triplicate classification
with that of Hesiod. The <cite>Just Medium</cite> thus describes
the first character:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is only the sage who is possessed of that clear discrimination and profound
intelligence which fit him for filling a high station; who possesses that
enlarged liberality and mild benignity which fit him for bearing with others;
who manifests that firmness and magnanimity that enable him to hold fast
good principles; who is actuated by that benevolence, justice, propriety, and
knowledge which command reverence; and who is so deeply learned in
polite learning and good principles as to qualify him rightly to discriminate.
Vast and extensive are the effects of his virtue; it is like the deep and living
stream which flows unceasingly; it is substantial and extensive as Heaven,
and profound as the great abyss. Wherever ships sail or chariots run; wherever
the heavens overshadow and the earth sustains; wherever the sun and
moon shine, or frosts and dews fall, among all who have blood and breath,
there is not one who does not honor and love him.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p></div>

<p>Sincerity or conscientiousness holds a high place among the
attributes of the superior or princely man; but in translating
the Chinese terms into English, it is sometimes puzzling enough
to find those which will exhibit the exact idea of the original.
For instance, sincerity is described as “the origin or consummation
of all things; without it, there would be nothing. It is
benevolence by which a man’s self is perfected, and knowledge
by which he perfects others.” In another place we read that
“one sincere wish would move heaven and earth.” The <i>kiun tsz’</i>
is supposed to possess these qualities. The standard of excellence
is placed so high as to be absolutely unattainable by unaided
human nature; and though Kih probably intended to
elevate the character of his grandfather to this height, and thus
hand him down to future ages as a <i>shing jin</i>, or ‘perfect and
holy man,’ he has, in the providence of God, done his countrymen
great service in setting before them such a character as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
here given in the <cite>Chung Yung</cite>. By being made a text-book
in the schools it has been constantly studied and memorized by
generations of students, to their great benefit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ANALECTS OF CONFUCIUS.</div>

<p>The third of the Four Books, called the <cite>Lun Yu</cite>, or ‘Analects
of Confucius,’ is divided into twenty chapters, in which
the collective body of his disciples recorded his words and actions,
much in the same way that Boswell did those of Johnson.
It has not, however, the merit of chronological arrangement,
and parts of it are so sententious as to be obscure, if not
almost unintelligible. This work discloses the sage’s shrewd
insight into the character of his countrymen, and knowledge of
the manner in which they could best be approached and influenced.
Upon the commencement of his career as reformer and
teacher, he contented himself with reviving the doctrines of
the “Ancients;” but finding his influence increasing as he
continued these instructions, he then&mdash;yet always as under their
authority&mdash;engrafted original ideas and tenets upon the minds
of his generation. Had even his loftiest sentiments been propounded
as his own, they would hardly have been received in
his day, and, perhaps, through the contempt felt for him by
his contemporaries, have been lost entirely.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable passages of the Four Books are
the following: Replying to the question of Tsz’-kung, “Is there
one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all of one’s
life?” Confucius said: “Is not <i>shu</i> (‘reciprocity’) such a
word? What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to
others.” In a previous place Tsz’-kung had said: “What I do
not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men.” Confucius
replied: “Tsz’, you have not attained to that.” The
same principle is repeated in the <cite>Chung Yung</cite>, where it is said
that the man who does so is not far from the path. Another
is quoted in the Imperial Dictionary, under the word <i>Fuh</i>:
“The people of the west have sages,” or “There is a sage (or
holy man) among the people of the west,” where the object is
to show that he did not mean Buddha. As Confucius was
contemporary with Ezra, it is not impossible that he had heard
something of the history of the Israelites scattered throughout
the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the Persian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
monarchy, or of the writings of their prophets, though there is not
the least historical evidence that he knew anything of the countries
in Western Asia, or of the books extant in their languages.</p>

<p>Some idea of the character of the <cite>Lun Yu</cite> may be gathered
from a few detached sentences, selected from Marshman’s
translation.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Grieve not that men know you not, but be grieved that you are ignorant of
men.</p>

<p>Governing with equity resembles the north star, which is fixed, and all the
stars surround it.</p>

<p>Have no friends unlike yourself.</p>

<p>Learning without reflection will profit nothing; reflection without learning
will leave the mind uneasy and miserable.</p>

<p>Knowledge produces pleasure clear as water; complete virtue brings happiness
solid as a mountain; knowledge pervades all things; virtue is tranquil
and happy; knowledge is delight; virtue is long life.</p>

<p>Without virtue, both riches and honor seem to me like the passing cloud.</p>

<p>The sage’s conduct is affection and benevolence in operation.</p>

<p>The man who possesses complete virtue wishes to fix his own mind
therein, and also to fix the minds of others; he wishes to be wise himself,
and would fain render others equally wise.</p>

<p>Those who, searching for virtue, refuse to stay among the virtuous, how can
they obtain knowledge?</p>

<p>The rich and honorable are those with whom men desire to associate; not
obtaining their company in the paths of virtue, however, do not remain in it.</p>

<p>In your appearance, to fall below decency would be to resemble a savage
rustic, to exceed it would be to resemble a fop; let your appearance be decent
and moderate, then you will resemble the honorable man.</p>

<p>When I first began with men, I heard words and gave credit for conduct;
now I hear words and observe conduct.</p>

<p>I have found no man who esteems virtue as men esteem pleasure.</p>

<p>The perfect man loves all men; he is not governed by private affection
or interest, but only regards the public good or right reason. The wicked
man, on the contrary, loves if you give, and likes if you commend him.</p>

<p>The perfect man is never satisfied with himself. He that is satisfied with
himself is not perfect.</p>

<p>He that is sedulous and desires to improve in his studies is not ashamed to
stoop to ask of others.</p>

<p>Sin in a virtuous man is like an eclipse of the sun and moon; all men
gaze at it, and it passes away; the virtuous man mends, and the world stands
in admiration of his fall.</p>

<p>Patience is the most necessary thing to have in this world.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">LIFE OF CONFUCIUS.</div>

<p>A few facts respecting the life, and observations on the character,
of the great sage of Chinese letters, may here be added,
though the extracts already made from his writings are sufficient
to show his style. Confucius was born <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 551, in the twentieth
year of the Emperor Ling (about the date at which Cyrus became
king of Persia), in the kingdom of Lu, now included in
Yenchau, in the south of Shantung. His father was a district
magistrate, and dying when he was only three years old, left
his care and education to his mother, who, although not so celebrated
as the mother of Mencius, seems to have nurtured in
him a respect for morality, and directed his studies. During
his youth he was remarkable for a grave demeanor and knowledge
of ancient learning, which gained him the respect and admiration
of his townsmen, so that at the age of twenty, the year
after his marriage, he was entrusted with the duties of a subordinate
office in the revenue department, and afterward appointed
a supervisor of fields and herds. In his twenty-fourth
year his mother deceased, and in conformity with the ancient
usage, which had then fallen into disuse, he immediately resigned
all his employments to mourn for her three years, during which
time he devoted himself to study. This practice has continued
to the present day.</p>

<p>His examination of the ancient writings led him to resolve
upon instructing his countrymen in them, and to revive the
usages of former kings, especially in whatever related to the
rites. His position gave him an entry to court in Lu, where
he met educated and influential men, and by the time he was
thirty he was already in repute among them as a teacher. His
own king, Siang, gave him the means of visiting the imperial
court at Lohyang. Here, together with his disciples, he examined
everything, past and present, with close scrutiny, and returned
home with renewed regard for the ancient founders of
the House of Chau. His scholars and admirers increased in
numbers, and a corresponding extension of fame followed, so
that ere long he had an invitation to the court of the prince of
Tsí, but on arrival there was mortified to learn that curiosity
had been the prevailing cause of the invitation, and not a desire
to adopt his principles. He accordingly left him and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
home, where the struggles between three rival families carried
disorder and misery throughout the kingdom; it was with the
greatest difficulty that he remained neutral between these factions.
His disciples were from all parts of the land, and public
opinion began to be influenced by his example. At length an
opportunity offered to put his tenets into practice. The civil
strife had resulted in the flight of the rebels, and Lu was
settling down into better government, when in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 500 Confucius
was made the magistrate of the town of Chung-tu by
his sovereign, Duke Ting. He was now fifty years old, and
began to carry out the best rule he could in his position as
minister of crime. For three years he administered the affairs
of State with such a mixture of zeal, prudence, severity, and
regard for the rights and wants of all classes, that Lu soon
became the envy and dread of all other States. He even
succeeded in destroying two or three baronial castles whose
chiefs had set all lawful authority at defiance. His precepts
had been fairly put in practice, and, like Solomon, his influence
in after-ages was increased by the fact of acknowledged
success.</p>

<p>It was but little more than an experiment, however; for Duke
King of Tsí, becoming envious of the growing power of his
neighbor, sent Ting a tempting present, consisting of thirty
horses beautifully caparisoned, and a number of curious rarities,
with a score of the most accomplished courtesans he could
procure in his territories. This scheme of gaining the favor of
the youthful monarch, and driving the obnoxious cynic from
his councils, succeeded, and Confucius soon after retired by
compulsion into private life. He moved into the dominions of
the prince of Wei, accompanied by such of his disciples as chose
to follow him, where he employed himself in extending his
doctrines and travelling into the adjoining States.</p>

<p>He was at times applauded and patronized, but quite as often
the object of persecution and contumely; more than once his
life was endangered. He compared himself to a dog driven
from his home: “I have the fidelity of that animal, and I am
treated like it. But what matters the ingratitude of men?
They cannot hinder me from doing all the good that has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
appointed me. If my precepts are disregarded, I have the consolation
of knowing in my own breast that I have faithfully
performed my duty.” He sometimes spoke in a manner that
showed his own impression to be that heaven had conferred
on him a special commission to instruct the world. On one or
two occasions, when he was in jeopardy, he said: “If Heaven
means not to obliterate this doctrine from the earth, the men
of Kwang can do nothing to me.” And “as Heaven has produced
whatever virtue is in me, what can Hwan Tui do to
me?”</p>

<p>In his instructions he improved passing events to afford useful
lessons, and some of those recorded are at least ingenious.
Observing a fowler one day sorting his birds into different cages,
he said, “I do not see any old birds here; where have you put
them?” “The old birds,” replied the fowler, “are too wary
to be caught; they are on the lookout, and if they see a net or
cage, far from falling into the snare they escape and never return.
Those young ones which are in company with them
likewise escape, but only such as separate into a flock by themselves
and rashly approach are the birds I take. If perchance
I catch an old bird it is because he follows the young ones.”
“You have heard him,” observed the sage, turning to his disciples;
“the words of this fowler afford us matter for instruction.
The young birds escape the snare only when they keep
with the old ones, the old ones are taken when they follow the
young; it is thus with mankind. Presumption, hardihood,
want of forethought, and inattention are the principal reasons
why young people are led astray. Inflated with their small
attainments they have scarcely made a commencement in learning
before they think they know everything; they have scarcely
performed a few common virtuous acts, and straight they fancy
themselves at the height of wisdom. Under this false impression
they doubt nothing, hesitate at nothing, pay attention to
nothing; they rashly undertake acts without consulting the
aged and experienced, and thus securely following their own
notions, they are misled and fall into the first snare laid for
them. If you see an old man of sober years so badly advised
as to be taken with the sprightliness of a youth, attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
him, and thinking and acting with him, he is led astray by
him and soon taken in the same snare. Do not forget the
answer of the fowler.”</p>

<p>Once, when looking at a stream, he compared its ceaseless
current to the transmission of good doctrine through succeeding
generations, and as one race had received it they should hand
it down to others. “Do not imitate those isolated men [the
Rationalists] who are wise only for themselves; to communicate
the modicum of knowledge and virtue we possess to others will
never impoverish ourselves.” He seems to have entertained
only faint hopes of the general reception of his doctrine, though
toward the latter end of his life he had as much encouragement
in the respect paid him personally and the increase of his
scholars as he could reasonably have wished.</p>

<p>Confucius returned to his native country at the age of sixty-eight,
and devoted his time to completing his edition of the
classics and in teaching his now large band of disciples. He
was consulted by his sovereign, who had invited him to return,
and one of his last acts was to go to court to urge an attack on
Tsí and punish the murder of its duke. Many legends have
gathered around him, so that he now stands before his countrymen
as a sage and a demigod; yet there is a remarkable
absence of the prophetic and the miraculous in every event connected
with these later writings. One story is that when he
had finished his writings he collected his friends around him
and made a solemn dedication of his literary labors to heaven
as the concluding act of his life. “He assembled all his disciples
and led them out of the town to one of the hills where
sacrifices had usually been offered for many years. Here he
erected a table or altar, upon which he placed the books; and
then turning his face to the north, adored Heaven, and returned
thanks upon his knees in a humble manner for having had life
and strength granted him to enable him to accomplish this
laborious undertaking; he implored Heaven to grant that the
benefit to his countrymen from so arduous a labor might not be
small. He had prepared himself for this ceremony by privacy,
fasting, and prayer. Chinese pictures represent the sage in the
attitude of supplication, and a beam of light or a rainbow de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>scending
from the sky upon the books, while his scholars stand
around in admiring wonder.”<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>A few days before his death he tottered about the house,
sighing,</p>

<p>He died soon after, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 478, aged seventy-three, leaving a
single descendant, his grandson Tsz’-sz, through whom the succession
has been transmitted to the present day. During his
life the return of the Jews from Babylon, the invasion of
Greece by Xerxes, and conquest of Egypt by the Persians took
place. Posthumous honors in great variety, amounting to idolatrous
worship, have been conferred upon him. His title is the
‘Most Holy Ancient Teacher’ Kung tsz’, and the ‘Holy Duke.’
In the reign of Kanghí, two thousand one hundred and fifty
years after his death, there were eleven thousand males alive
bearing his name, and most of them of the seventy-fourth generation,
being undoubtedly one of the oldest families in the
world. In the <cite>Sacrificial Ritual</cite> a short account of his life is
given, which closes with the following pæan:</p>

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF THE CONFUCIAN SYSTEM.</div>

<p>The leading features of the philosophy of Confucius are subordination
to superiors and kind, upright dealing with our fellow-men;
destitute of all reference to an unseen Power to whom
all men are accountable, they look only to this world for their
sanctions, and make the monarch himself only partially amenable
to a higher tribunal. It would indeed be hard to over-estimate
the influence of Confucius in his ideal <i>princely scholar</i>,
and the power for good over his race this conception ever since
has exerted. It might be compared to the glorious work of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
sculptor on the Acropolis of Athens&mdash;that matchless statue
more than seventy feet in height, whose casque and spear of
burnished brass glittered above all the temples and high places
of the city, and engaged the constant gaze of the mariner on
the near Ægean; guiding his onward course, it was still ever
beyond his reach. Like the Athena Promachos to the ancient
Attic voyager, so stands the <i>kiun-tsz’</i> of Confucius among the
ideal men of pagan moralists. The immeasurable influence
in after-ages of the character thus portrayed proves how lofty
was his own standard, and the national conscience has ever
since assented to the justice of the portrait.</p>

<p>From the duty, honor, and obedience owed by a child to his
parents, he proceeds to inculcate the obligations of wives to their
husbands, subjects to their prince, and ministers to their king,
together with all the obligations arising from the various social
relations. Political morality must be founded on private rectitude,
and the beginning of all real advance was, in his opinion,
comprised in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nosce teipsum</i>. It cannot be denied that among
much that is commendable there are a few exceptionable dogmas
among his tenets, and Dr. Legge, as has already been seen,
reflects severely on his disregard of truth in the <cite>Chun Tsiu</cite>
and in his lifetime. Yet compared with the precepts of Grecian
and Roman sages, the general tendency of his writings is good,
while in adaptation to the society in which he lived, and their
eminently practical character, they exceed those of western
philosophers. He did not deal much in sublime and unattainable
descriptions of virtue, but rather taught how the common
intercourse of life was to be maintained&mdash;how children should
conduct themselves toward their parents, when a man should
enter on office, when to marry, etc., etc., which, although they
may seem somewhat trifling to us, were probably well calculated
for the times and people among whom he lived.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span></p>
<p>Had Confucius transmitted to posterity such works as the
Iliad, the De Officiis, or the Dialogues of Plato, he would no
doubt have taken a higher rank among the commanding intellects
of the world, but it may be well doubted whether his influence
among his own countrymen would have been as good or
as lasting. The variety and minuteness of his instructions for
the nurture and education of children, the stress he lays upon
filial duty, the detail of etiquette and conduct he gives for the
intercourse of all classes and ranks in society, characterize his
writings from those of all philosophers in other countries, who,
comparatively speaking, gave small thought to the education of
the young. The Four Books and the Five Classics would not,
so far as regards their intrinsic character in comparison with
other productions, be considered as anything more than curiosities
in literature for their antiquity and language, were it not
for the incomparable influence they have exerted over so many
millions of minds; in this view they are invested with an interest
which no book, besides the Bible, can claim. The source
and explanation of this influence is to be found in their use as
text-books in the schools and competitive examinations, and
well would it be for Christian lands if their youth had the same
knowledge of the writings of Solomon and the Evangelists.
Their freedom from descriptions of impurity and licentiousness,
and allusions to whatever debases and vitiates the heart, is a
redeeming quality of the Chinese classics which should not be
overlooked. Chinese literature contains enough, indeed, to pollute
even the mind of a heathen, but its scum has become the
sediment; and little or nothing can be found in the writings
that are most highly prized which will not bear perusal by any
person in any country. Every one acquainted with the writings
of Hindu, Greek, and Roman poets knows the glowing descriptions
of the amours of gods and goddesses which fill their
pages, and the purity of the Chinese canonical books in this
respect must be considered as remarkable.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Worship of Confucius and his Disciples.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">WORSHIP OF CONFUCIUS.</div>

<p>For the most part the Chinese, in worshipping Confucius, content
themselves with erecting a simple tablet in his honor; to
carve images for the cult of the sage is uncommon. The incident
represented in the adjoining wood-cut illustrates, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
an exception to the prevailing severity of this worship. A certain
Wei Kí, a scholar living in the Tang dynasty (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 657), not
content, it is said, with giving instruction in the classics, set up
the life-size statues of Confucius and his seventy-two disciples
in order to incite the enthusiasm of his own pupils. Into this
sanctuary of the divinities of learning were wont to come the
<i>savant</i> Wei and his scholars&mdash;among whom were numbered
both his grandfather and several of his grandchildren&mdash;to prostrate
themselves before the ancient worthies. “But of his descendants,”
concludes the chronicler, “there were many who
arose to positions of eminence in the State.”</p>

<p>The last of the Four Books is nearly as large as the other
three united, and consists entirely of the writings of Mencius,
Măng tsz’, or Măng fu-tsz’, as he is called by the Chinese.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
This sage flourished upward of a century after the death of his
master, and although, in estimating his character, it must not
be forgotten that he had the advantages of his example and
stimulus of his fame and teachings, in most respects he displayed
an originality of thought, inflexibility of purpose, and
extensive views superior to Confucius, and must be regarded
as one of the greatest men Asiatic nations have ever produced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIFE OF MENCIUS.</div>

<p>Mencius was born <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 371,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> in the city of Tsau, now in the
province of Shantung, not far from his master’s native district.
He was twenty-three years old when Plato died, and many
other great men of Greece were his contemporaries. His
father died early, and left the guardianship of the boy to his
widow, Changshí. “The care of this prudent and attentive
mother,” to quote from Rémusat, “has been cited as a model
for all virtuous parents. The house she occupied was near that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
of a butcher; she observed that at the first cry of the animals
that were being slaughtered the little Măng ran to be present
at the sight, and that on his return he sought to imitate what
he had seen. Fearful that his heart might become hardened,
and be accustomed to the sight of blood, she removed to another
house which was in the neighborhood of a cemetery.
The relations of those who were buried there came often to
weep upon their graves and make the customary libations; the
lad soon took pleasure in their ceremonies, and amused himself
in imitating them. This was a new subject of uneasiness to
Changshí; she feared her son might come to consider as a jest
what is of all things the most serious, and that he would acquire
a habit of performing with levity, and as a matter of
routine merely, ceremonies which demand the most exact attention
and respect. Again, therefore, she anxiously changed her
dwelling, and went to live in the city, opposite to a school,
where her son found examples the most worthy of imitation,
and soon began to profit by them. I should not have spoken
of this trifling anecdote but for the allusion which the Chinese
constantly make to it in the common proverb, ‘Formerly the
mother of Mencius chose out a neighborhood.’” On another
occasion her son, seeing persons slaughtering pigs, asked her
why they did it. “To feed you,” she replied; but reflecting
that this was teaching her son to lightly regard the truth, went
and bought some pork and gave him.</p>

<p>Mencius devoted himself early to the classics, and probably
attended the instructions of noted teachers of the school of
Confucius and his grandson Kih. After his studies were completed,
at the age of forty, he came forth as a public teacher,
and offered his services to the feudal princes of the country.
Among others, he was received by Hwui, king of Wei, but,
though much respected by this ruler, his instructions were not
regarded; and he soon perceived that among the numerous
petty rulers and intriguing statesmen of the day there was no
prospect of restoring tranquillity to the Empire, and that discourses
upon the mild government and peaceful virtues of Yao
and Shun, King Wăn and Chingtang, offered little to interest
persons whose minds were engrossed with schemes of conquest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
or pleasure. He thereupon accepted an invitation to go to Tsí,
the adjoining State, and spent most of his public life there;
the records show that he was often called on for his advice by
statesmen of many governments. As he went from one State
to another his influence extended as his experience showed him
the difficulties of good government amidst the general disregard
of justice, mercy, and frugality. His own unyielding character
and stern regard for etiquette and probity chilled the loose,
unscrupulous men of those lawless times. At length he retired
to his home to spend the last twenty years of his life in the
society of his disciples, there completing the work which bears
his name and has made him such a power among his countrymen.
He has always been an incentive and guide to popular
efforts to assert the rights of the subject against the injustice
of rulers, and an encourager to rulers who have governed with
justice. His assertion of the proper duties and prerogatives
belonging to both parties in the State was prior to that of any
western writer; some of his principles of liberal government
were taught before their enunciation in Holy Writ. He died
when eighty-four years old (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 288), shortly before the death
of Ptolemy Soter at the same age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSONAL CHARACTER OF HIS TEACHINGS.</div>

<p>After his demise Mencius was honored, by public act, with
the title of ‘Holy Prince of the country of Tsau,’ and in the
temple of the sages he receives the same honors as Confucius;
his descendants bear the title of ‘Masters of the Traditions
concerning the Classics,’ and he himself is called <i>A-shing</i>, or
the ‘Secondary Sage,’ Confucius being regarded as the first.
His writings are in the form of dialogues held with the great
personages of his time, and abound with irony and ridicule
directed against vice and oppression, which only make his
praises of virtue and integrity more weighty. After the manner
of Socrates, he contests nothing with his adversaries, but,
while granting their premises, he seeks to draw from them consequences
the most absurd, which cover his opponents with confusion.</p>

<p>The king of Wei, one of the turbulent princes of the time,
was complaining to Mencius how ill he succeeded in his endeavors
to make his people happy and his kingdom flourishing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
“Prince,” said the philosopher, “you love war; permit me to
draw a comparison from thence: two armies are in presence;
the charge is sounded, the battle begins, one of the parties is
conquered; half its soldiers have fled a hundred paces, the
other half has stopped at fifty. Will the last have any right to
mock at those who have fled further than themselves?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the king; “they have equally taken flight, and
the same disgrace must attend them both.”</p>

<p>“Prince,” says Mencius quickly, “cease then to boast of your
efforts as greater than your neighbors’. You have all deserved
the same reproach, and not one has a right to take credit to
himself over another.” Pursuing then his bitter interrogations,
he asked, “Is there a difference, O king! between killing a
man with a club or with a sword?” “No,” said the prince.
“Between him who kills with the sword, or destroys by an inhuman
tyranny?” “No,” again replied the prince.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mencius, “your kitchens are encumbered with
food, your sheds are full of horses, while your subjects, with
emaciated countenances, are worn down with misery, or found
dead of hunger in the middle of the fields or the deserts.
What is this but to breed animals to prey on men? And what
is the difference between destroying them by the sword or by
unfeeling conduct? If we detest those savage animals which
mutually tear and devour each other, how much more should
we abhor a prince who, instead of being a father to his people,
does not hesitate to rear animals to destroy them. What kind
of father to his people is he who treats his children so unfeelingly,
and has less care of them than of the wild beasts he provides
for?”</p>

<p>On one occasion, addressing the prince of Tsí, Mencius remarked:
“It is not the ancient forests of a country which do it
honor, but its families devoted for many generations to the
duties of the magistracy. Oh, king! in all your service there
are none such; those whom you yesterday raised to honor,
what are they to-day?”</p>

<p>“In what way,” replied the king, “can I know beforehand
that they are without virtue, and remove them?”</p>

<p>“In raising a sage to the highest dignities of the State,” re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>plied
the philosopher, “a king acts only as he is of necessity
bound to do. But to put a man of obscure condition over the
nobles of his kingdom, or one of his remote kindred over
princes more nearly connected with him, demands most careful
deliberation. Do his courtiers unite in speaking of a man as
wise, let him distrust them. If all the magistrates of his kingdom
concur in the same assurance, let him not rest satisfied
with their testimony, but if his subjects confirm the story, then
let him convince himself; and if he finds that the individual is
indeed a sage, let him raise him to office and honor. So, also,
if all his courtiers would oppose his placing confidence in a
minister, let him not give heed to them; and if all the magistrates
are of this opinion, let him be deaf to their solicitations;
but if the people unite in the same request, then let him examine
the object of their ill-will, and, if guilty, remove him. In
short, if all the courtiers think that a minister should suffer
death, the prince must not content himself with their opinion
merely. If all the high officers entertain the same sentiment,
still he must not yield to their convictions; but if the people
declare that such a man is unfit to live, then the prince, inquiring
himself and being satisfied that the charge is true, must
condemn the guilty to death; in such a case, we may say that
the people are his judges. In acting thus a prince becomes
the parent of his subjects.”</p>

<p>The will of the people is always referred to as the supreme
power in the State, and Mencius warns princes that they must
both please and benefit their people, observing that “if the
country is not subdued in heart there will be no such thing as
governing it;” and also, “He who gains the hearts of the people
secures the throne, and he who loses the people’s hearts
loses the throne.” A prince should “give and take what is
pleasing to them, and not do that which they hate.” “Good
laws,” he further remarks, “are not equal to winning the people
by good instruction.” Being consulted by a sovereign, whether
he ought to attempt the conquest of a neighboring territory, he
answered: “If the people of Yen are delighted, then take it;
but if otherwise, not.” He also countenances the dethroning of
a king who does not rule his people with a regard to their hap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>piness,
and adduces the example of the founders of the Shang
and Chau dynasties in proof of its propriety. “When the
prince is guilty of great errors,” is his doctrine, “the minister
should reprove him; if, after doing so again and again, he does
not listen, he ought to dethrone him and put another in his
place.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS ESTIMATE OF HUMAN NATURE.</div>

<p>His estimate of human nature, like many of the Chinese
sages, is high, believing it to be originally good, and that “all
men are naturally virtuous, as all water flows downward. All
men have compassionate hearts, all feel ashamed of vice.” But
he says also, “Shame is of great moment to men; it is only the
designing and artful that find no use for shame.” Yet human
nature must be tried by suffering, and to form an energetic and
virtuous character a man must endure much; “when Heaven
was about to place Shun and others in important trusts, it first
generally tried their minds, inured them to abstinence, exposed
them to poverty and adversity; thus it moved their hearts and
taught them patience.” His own character presents traits
widely differing from the servility and baseness usually ascribed
to Asiatics, and especially to the Chinese; and he seems to
have been ready to sacrifice everything to his principles. “I
love life, and I love justice,” he observes, “but if I cannot preserve
both, I would give up life and hold fast justice. Although
I love life, there is that which I love more than life; although
I hate death, there is that which I hate more than death.” And
as if referring to his own integrity, he elsewhere says: “The
nature of the superior man is such that, although in a high and
prosperous situation, it adds nothing to his virtue; and although
in low and distressed circumstances, it impairs it in nothing.”
In many points, especially in the importance he gives to filial
duty, his reverence for the ancient books and princes, and his
adherence to old usages, Mencius imitated and upheld Confucius;
in native vigor and carelessness of the reproaches of his
compatriots he exceeded him. Many translations of his work
have appeared in European languages, but Legge’s<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> is in most
respects the best for its comments, and the notices of Men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>cius’
life and times, and a fair estimate of his character and influence.</p>

<p>Returning to the Imperial Catalogue, its ninth section contains
a list of musical works, and a few on dancing or posture-making;
they hold this distinguished place in the list from the
importance attached to music as employed in the State worship
and domestic ceremonies.</p>

<p>The tenth section gives the names of philological treatises
and lexicons, most of them confined to the Chinese language,
though a few are in Manchu. The Chinese government has
excelled in the attention it has given to the compilation of lexicons
and encyclopædias. The number of works of this sort
here catalogued is two hundred and eighteen, the major part
issued during this dynasty, and including only works on the
general language, none on the dialects. For their extent of
quotation, the variety of separate disquisitions upon the form,
origin, and composition of characters, and treatises upon subjects
connected with the language, they indicate the careful
labor native scholars have bestowed upon the elucidation of
their own tongue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KANGHÍ’S DICTIONARY.</div>

<p>One of them, the <cite>Pei Wăn Yun Fu</cite>, or ‘Treasury of compared
Characters and Sounds,’ is so extensive and profound as
to deserve a short notice, which cannot be better made than by
an extract from the preface of M. Callery to his prospectus to
its translation, of which he only issued one livraison. He says
the Emperor Kanghí, who planned its preparation, “assembled
in his palace the most distinguished literati of the Empire, and
laying before them all the works that could be got, whether
ancient or modern, commanded them carefully to collect all the
words, allusions, forms and figures of speech of every style, of
which examples might be found in the Chinese language; to
class the principal articles according to the pronunciation of the
words; to devote a distinct paragraph to each expression; and
to give in support of every paragraph several quotations from
the original works. Stimulated by the munificence, as well as
the example, of the Emperor, who reviewed the performances
of every day, seventy-six literati assembled at Peking, labored
with such assiduity, and kept up such an active correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
with the learned in all parts of the Empire, that at the end of
eight years the work was completed (1711), and printed at the
public expense, in one hundred and thirty thick volumes.” The
peculiar nature of the Chinese language, in the formation of
many dissyllabic compounds of two or more characters to express
a third and new idea, renders such a work as this thesaurus
more necessary and useful, perhaps, than it would be in any
other language. Under some of the common characters as
many as three hundred, four hundred, and even six hundred
combinations are noticed, all of which modify its sense more or
less, and form a complete monograph of the character, of the
highest utility to the scholar in composing idiomatic Chinese.
This magnificent monument of literary labor reflects great
credit on the monarch who took so much interest in its compilation
(as he remarks in his preface), as to devote the leisure
hours of every day, notwithstanding his manifold occupations,
for eight years, to overlooking the labors of the scholars engaged
upon it.</p>

<span class="smaller">POLITE LITERATURE OF THE CHINESE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The three remaining divisions of the Imperial Catalogue
comprise lists of Historical, Professional, and Poetical works.
The estimate made of their value will depend somewhat on the
peculiar line of research of the student, and to give him the
means of doing this would require copious extracts from poetical,
religious, topographical or moral writings. Those who
have studied them the longest, as Rémusat, Julien, Staunton,
Pauthier, the two Morrisons, Legge, etc., speak of them with
the most respect, whether it arose from a higher appreciation
of their worth as they learned more, or that the zealousness of
their studies imparted a tinge of enthusiasm to their descriptions.
A writer in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> gives good reasons
for placing the polite literature of the Chinese first for the insight
it is likely to give Europeans into their habits of thought.
“The Chinese stand eminently distinguished from other
Asiatics by their early possession and extensive use of the important
art of printing&mdash;of printing, too, in that particular shape,
the stereotype, which is best calculated, by multiplying the
copies and cheapening the price, to promote the circulation of
every species of their literature. Hence they are, as might be
expected, a reading people; a certain degree of education is
common among even the lower classes, and among the higher it
is superfluous to insist on the great estimation in which letters
must be held under a system where learning forms the very
threshold of the gate that conducts to fame, honors, and civil
employment. Amid the vast mass of printed books which is

scruple to avow that the circle of their <i>belles-lettres</i>, comprised
under the heads of drama, poetry, and novels, has always possessed
the highest place in our esteem; and we must say that
there appears no readier or more agreeable mode of becoming
intimately acquainted with a people from whom Europe can
have so little to learn on the score of either moral or physical
science than by drawing largely on the inexhaustible stores of
their ornamental literature.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE WORKS ON HISTORY.</div>

<p>The second division in the Catalogue, <cite>Sz’ Pu</cite>, or ‘Historical
Writings,’ is subdivided into fifteen sections. These writings
are very extensive; even their mere list conveys a high idea of
the vast amount of labor expended upon them; and it is impossible
to withhold respect, at least, to the industry displayed in
compilations like the <cite>Seventeen Histories</cite>, in two hundred and
seventeen volumes, and its continuation, the <cite>Twenty-two Histories</cite>,
a still larger work. Though the entertaining episodes
and sketches of character found in Herodotus and other ancient
European historians are wanting, there is plenty of incident in
court, camp, and social life, as well as public acts and royal
biography. The dynastic records became the duty of special
officers, and the headings adopted from the Sui, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 590, have
since been followed in arranging the historic materials under
twelve heads. From the mass of materials digested by careful
scholars have been compiled the records now known; they
form, with all their imperfections, the best continuous history
of any Asiatic people. Popular abridgments are common,
among which the <cite>Tung Kien Kang-muh</cite>, or ‘General Mirror
of History,’ and a compiled abridgment of it, the <cite>Kang Kien Í
Chí</cite>, or ‘History made Easy,’ are the most useful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HISTORIANS SZ’MA TSIEN AND SZ’MA KWANG.</div>

<p>The earliest historian among the Chinese is Sz’ma Tsien,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> who
flourished about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 104, in which year he commenced the <cite>Sz’
Kí</cite>, or ‘Historical Memoirs,’ in one hundred and thirty chapters.
In this great work, which, like the Muses of Herodotus
in Greek, forms the commencement of credible modern history
with the Chinese, the author relates the actions of the Emperors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
in regular succession and the principal events which happened
during their reigns, together with details and essays respecting
music, astronomy, religious ceremonies, weights, public works,
etc., and the changes they had undergone during the twenty-two
centuries embraced in his Memoirs. It is stated by Rémusat
that there are in the whole work five hundred and twenty-six
thousand five hundred characters, for the Chinese, like the
ancient Hebrews, number the words in their standard authors.
The <cite>Sz’ Kí</cite> is in five parts, and its arrangement has served as
a model for subsequent historians, few of whom have equalled
its author in the vivacity of their style or carefulness of their
research.</p>

<p>The <cite>General Mirror to Aid in Governing</cite>, by Sz’ma Kwang,
of the Sung dynasty, in two hundred and ninety-four chapters,
is one of the best digested and most lucid annals that Chinese
scholars have produced, embracing the period between the end
of the Tsin to the beginning of the Sung dynasty (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 313 to
960). Both the historians Sz’ma Tsien and Sz’ma Kwang filled
high offices in the State, were both alternately disgraced and
honored, and were mixed up with all the political movements
of the day. Rémusat speaks in terms of deserved commendation
of their writings, and to a notice of their works adds some
account of their lives. One or two incidents in the career of
Sz’ma Kwang exhibit a readiness of action and freedom in expressing
his sentiments which are more common among the
Chinese than is usually supposed. In his youth he was standing
with some companions near a large vase used to rear gold
fish, when one of them fell in. Too terrified themselves to do
anything, all but young Kwang ran to seek succor; he looked
around for a stone with which to break the vase and let the
water flow out, and thus saved the life of his companion. In
subsequent life the same common sense was joined with a boldness
which led him to declare his sentiments on all occasions.
Some southern people once sent a present to the Emperor of a
strange quadruped, which his flatterers said was the mythological
<i>kí-lin</i> of happy omen. Sz’ma Kwang, being consulted on
the matter, replied: “I have never seen the <i>kí-lin</i>, therefore I
cannot tell whether this be one or not. What I do know is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
the real <i>kí-lin</i> could never be brought hither by foreigners; he
appears of himself when the State is well governed.”<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> An extension
of this great work by Lí Tao, of the Sung dynasty, in
five hundred and twenty books, gave their countrymen a fair
account of the thirty-six centuries of their national fortunes;
and the digest under Chu Hí’s direction has made them still
more accessible and famous to succeeding ages.</p>

<p>Few works in Chinese literature are more popular than a
historical novel by Chin Shau, about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 350, called the <cite>San
Kwoh Chí</cite>, or ‘History of the Three States;’ its scenes are laid
in the northern parts of China, and include the period between
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 170 and 317, when several ambitious chieftains conspired
against the imbecile princes of the once famous Han dynasty,
and, after that was overthrown, fought among themselves until
the Empire was again reconsolidated under the Tsin dynasty.
This performance, from its double character and the long period
over which it extends, necessarily lacks that unity which a novel
should have. Its charms, to a Chinese, consist in the animated
descriptions of plots and counterplots, in the relations of battles,
sieges, and retreats, and the admirable manner in which the
characters are delineated and their acts intermixed with entertaining
episodes. The work opens with describing the distracted
state of the Empire under the misrule of Ling tí and
Hwan tí, the last two monarchs of the House of Han (147 to
184), who were entirely swayed by eunuchs, and left the administration
of government to reckless oppressors, until ambitious
men, taking advantage of the general discontent, raised
the standard of rebellion. The leaders ordered their partisans
to wear yellow head-dresses, whence the rebellion was called
that of the Yellow Caps, and was suppressed only after several
years of hard struggle by a few distinguished generals who upheld
the throne. Among these was Tung Choh, who, gradually
drawing to himself all the power in the State, thereby arrayed
against himself others equally ambitious and unscrupulous.
Disorganization had not yet proceeded so far that all hope of
supporting the rightful throne had left the minds of its adher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>ents,
among whom was Wang Yun, a chancellor of the Empire,
who, seeing the danger of the State, devised a scheme to
inveigle Tung Choh to his ruin, which is thus narrated:</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXTRACT FROM THE HISTORY OF THE THREE STATES.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One day Tung Choh gave a great entertainment to the officers of government.
When the wine had circulated several times, Lü Pu (his adopted son)
whispered something in his ear, whereupon he ordered the attendants to take
Chang Wăn from the table into the hall below, and presently one of them returned,
handing up his head in a charger. The spirits of all present left their
bodies, but Tung, laughing, said, “Pray, sirs, do not be alarmed. Chang
Wăn has been leaguing with Yuen Shuh how to destroy me; a messenger just
now brought a letter for him, and inadvertently gave it to my son; for which
he has lost his life. You, gentlemen, have no cause for dread.” All the
officers replied, “Yes! Yes!” and immediately separated.</p>

<p>Chancellor Wang Yun returned home in deep thought: “The proceedings
of this day’s feast are enough to make my seat an uneasy one;” and taking
his cane late at night he walked out in the moonlight into his rear garden,
when standing near a rose arbor and weeping as he looked up, he heard a
person sighing and groaning within the peony pavillion. Carefully stepping
and watching, he saw it was Tiau Chen, a singing-girl belonging to the house,
who had been taken into his family in early youth and taught to sing and
dance; she was now sixteen, and both beautiful and accomplished, and Wang
treated her as if she had been his own daughter.</p>

<p>Listening some time, he spoke out, “What underhand plot are you at now,
insignificant menial?” Tiau Chen, much alarmed, kneeling, said, “What
treachery can your slave dare to devise?” “If you have nothing secret, why
then are you here late at night sighing in this manner?” Tiau replied, “Permit
your handmaid to declare her inmost thoughts. I am very grateful for
your excellency’s kind nurture, for teaching me singing and dancing, and for
the treatment I have received. If my body should be crushed to powder [in
your service], I could not requite a myriad to one [for these favors]. But
lately I have seen your eyebrows anxiously knit, doubtless from some State
affairs, though I presumed not to ask; this evening, too, I saw you restless in
your seat. On this account I sighed, not imagining your honor was overlooking
me. If I can be of the least use, I would not decline the sacrifice of a thousand
lives.” Wang, striking his cane on the ground, exclaimed, “Who
would have thought the rule of Han was lodged in your hands! Come with
me into the picture-gallery.” Tiau Chen following in, he ordered his females
all to retire, and placing her in a seat, turned himself around and did her
obeisance. She, much surprised, prostrated herself before him, and asked
the reason of such conduct, to which he replied, “You are able to compassionate
all the people in the dominions of Han.” His words ended, the tears
gushed like a fountain. She added, “I just now said, if I can be of any service
I will not decline, though I should lose my life.”</p>

<p>Wang, kneeling, rejoined, “The people are in most imminent danger, and
the nobility in a hazard like that of eggs piled up; neither can be rescued
without your assistance. The traitor Tung Choh wishes soon to seize the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
throne, and none of the civil or military officers have any practicable means
of defence. He has an adopted son, Lü Pu, a remarkably daring and brave
man, who, like himself, is the slave of lust. Now I wish to contrive a scheme
to inveigle them both, by first promising to wed you to Lü, and then offering
you to Tung, while you must seize the opportunity to raise suspicions in them,
and slander one to the other so as to sever them, and cause Lü to kill Tung,
whereby the present great evils will be terminated, the throne upheld, and
the government re-established. All this is in your power, but I do not know
how the plan strikes you.” Tiau answered, “I have promised your excellency
my utmost service, and you may trust me that I will devise some good
scheme when I am offered to them.”</p>

<p>“You must be aware that if this design leaks out, we shall all be utterly
exterminated.” “Your excellency need not be anxious, and if I do not aid
in accomplishing your patriotic designs, let me die a thousand deaths.”</p>

<p>Wang, bowing, thanked her. The next day, taking several of the brilliant
pearls preserved in the family, he ordered a skilful workman to inlay them
into a golden coronet, which he secretly sent as a present to Lü Pu. Highly
gratified, Lü himself went to Wang’s house to thank him, where a well-prepared
feast of viands and wine awaited his arrival. Wang went out to meet
him, and waiting upon him into the rear hall, invited him to sit at the top of
the table, but Lü objected: “I am only a general in the prime minister’s department,
while your excellency is a high minister in his Majesty’s court&mdash;why
this mistaken respect?”</p>

<p>Wang rejoined, “There is no hero in the country now besides you; I do
not pay this honor to your office, but to your talents.” Lü was excessively
pleased. Wang ceased not in engaging him to drink, the while speaking of
Tung Choh’s high qualities, and praising his guest’s virtues, who, on his side,
wildly laughed for joy. Most of the attendants were ordered to retire, a few
waiting-maids stopping to serve out wine, when, being half drunk, he ordered
them to tell the young child to come in. Shortly after, two pages led in
Tiau Chen, gorgeously dressed, and Lü, much astonished, asked, “Who is
this?”</p>

<p>“It is my little daughter, Tiau Chen, whom I have ordered to come in and
see you, for I am very grateful for your honor’s misapplied kindness to me,
which has been like that to near relatives.” He then bade her present a goblet
of wine to him, and, as she did so, their eyes glanced to and from each
other.</p>

<p>Wang, feigning to be drunk, said: “The child strongly requests your honor
to drink many cups; my house entirely depends upon your excellency.” Lü
requested her to be seated, but she acting as if about to retire, Wang remarked,
“The general is my intimate friend; be seated, my child; what are
you afraid of?” She then sat down at his side, while Lü’s eyes never strayed
from their gaze upon her, drinking and looking.</p>

<p>Wang, pointing to Tiau, said to Lü, “I wish to give this girl to you as a concubine,
but know not whether you will receive her?” Lü, leaving the table
to thank him, said, “If I could obtain such a girl as this, I would emulate
the requital dogs and horses give for the care taken of them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span></p>

<p>Wang rejoined, “I will immediately select a lucky day, and send her to your
house.” Lü was delighted beyond measure, and never took his eyes off her,
while Tiau herself, with ogling glances, intimated her passion. The feast
shortly after broke up, and Lü departed.</p></div>

<p>The scheme here devised was successful, and Tung Choh was
assassinated by his son when he was on his way to depose the
monarch. His death, however, brought no peace to the country,
and three chieftains, Tsau Tsau, Liu Pí, and Sun Kiuen,
soon distinguished themselves in their struggles for power, and
afterward divided the Empire into the three States of Wu,
Shuh, and Wei, from which the work derives its name. Many
of the personages who figure in this work have since been deified,
among whom are Liu Pí’s sworn brother Kwan Yü, who is
now the Mars (<i>Kwan tí</i>), and Hwa To, the Esculapius, of Chinese
mythology. Its scenes and characters have all been fruitful
subjects for the pencil and the pen of artists and poetasters.
One commentator has gone so far as to incorporate his reflections
in the body of the text itself, in the shape of such expressions as
“Wonderful speech! What rhodomontade! This man was a
fool before, and shows himself one now!” Davis likens this
work to the Iliad for its general arrangement and blustering
character of the heroes; it was composed when the scenes described
and their leading actors existed chiefly in personal recollection,
and the remembrances of both were fading away in the
twilight of popular legends.</p>

<p>Among the numerous historians of China, only a few would
repay the labor of an entire translation, but many would furnish
good materials for extended epitomes. Among these are
the <cite>Tso Chuen</cite>, already noticed; the <cite>Anterior Han Dynasty</cite>,
by Pan Ku and his sister; the <cite>Wei Shu</cite>, by Wei Shau (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
386-556); and the works of Sz’ma Kwang. In addition to the
dynastic histories, numerous similar works classified under the
heads of annals and complete records in two sections of this
division would furnish much authentic material for the foreign
archæologist. The most valuable relic after the <cite>Chun Tsiu</cite>,
of a historic character, is the “Bamboo Books,” reported to
have been found in a tomb in Honan, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 279; it gives a
chronological list down to <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 299, with incidents interspersed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span>
and bears many internal evidences of genuineness. Legge and
Biot have each translated it.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BIOGRAPHIES AND STATISTICS.</div>

<p>Biographies of distinguished men and women are numerous,
and their preparation forms a favorite branch of literary labor.
It is noticeable to observe the consideration paid to literary
women in these memoirs, and the praises bestowed upon discreet
mothers whose talented children are considered to be the
criteria of their careful training. One work of this class is in
one hundred and twenty volumes, called <cite>Sing Pu</cite>, but it does
not possess the incident and animation which are found in some
less formal biographical dictionaries. The <cite>Lieh Nü Chuen</cite>, or
‘Memoirs of Distinguished Ladies’ of ancient times, by Liu
Hiang, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 125, is often cited by writers on female education
who wish to show how women were anciently trained to the
practice of every virtue and accomplishment. If a Chinese
author cannot quote a case to illustrate his position at least
eight or ten centuries old, he thinks half its force abated by its
youth. Biographical works are almost as numerous as statistical,
and afford one of the best sources for studying the national
character; some of them, like the lives of Washington or
Cromwell in our own literature, combine both history and
biography.</p>

<p>Some of the statistical and geographical works mentioned in
this division are noticed on p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>. Among those on the Constitution
is the ‘Complete Antiquarian Researches’ of Ma
Twan-lin (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1275), in three hundred and forty-eight chapters.
It forms a most extensive and profound work, containing researches
upon every matter relating to government, and extending
through a series of dynasties which held the throne nearly
forty centuries. Rémusat goes so far as to say: “This excellent
work is a library by itself, and if Chinese literature possessed
no other, the language would be worth learning for the
sake of reading this alone.” No book has been more drawn
upon by Europeans for information concerning matters relating
to Eastern Asia than this; Visdelou and De Guignes took from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
it much of their information relating to the Tartars and Huns;
and Pingsé extracted his account of the comets and ærolites
from its pages, besides some geographical and ethnographical
papers. Rémusat often made use of its stores, and remarks that
many parts merit an entire translation, which can be said, indeed,
of few Chinese authors. A supplement prepared and
published in 1586 by Wang Kí brings it down to that date. A
further revision was issued under imperial patronage in 1772,
and a final one not long afterward, continuing the narrative
to the reign of Kanghí.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> It elevates our opinion of a nation
whose literature can boast of a work like this, exhibiting such
patient investigation and candid comparison of authorities, such
varied research and just discrimination of what is truly important,
and so extensive a mass of facts and opinions upon every
subject of historic interest. Although there be no quotations
in it from Roman or Greek classic authors, and the ignorance
of the compiler of what was known upon the same subjects in
other countries disqualified him from giving his remarks the
completeness they would otherwise have had, yet when the
stores of knowledge from western lands are made known to a
people whose scholars can produce such works as this, the <cite>Memoirs</cite>
of Sz’ma Tsien, and others equally good, it may reasonably
be expected that they will not lack in industry or ability to
carry on their researches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS.</div>

<p>The third division of <cite>Tsz’ Pu</cite>, ‘Scholastic’ or ‘Professional
Writings,’ is arranged under fourteen sections, viz.: Philosophical,
Military, Legal, Agricultural, Medical, Mathematical, and
Magical writings, works on the Liberal Arts, Collections, Miscellanies,
Encyclopædias, Novels, and treatises on the tenets of
the Buddhists and Rationalists. The first section is called <cite>Jü
Kia Lui</cite>, meaning the ‘Works of the Literary Family,’ under
which name is included those who maintain, discuss, and teach
the tenets of the sages, although they may not accept all that
Confucius taught. This class of books is worthy of far more
examination than foreigners have hitherto given to it, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
will find that Chinese philosophers have discussed morals, government,
cosmogony, and like subjects, with a freedom and
acuteness that has not been credited to them.</p>

<p>It was during the Sung dynasty, when Europe was utterly
lethargic and unprogressive, that China showed a marvellous
mental activity, and received from Ching, Chu, Chau, and their
disciples a molding and conservative influence which has remained
to this day. An extract from a discussion by Chu Hí
will show the way in which he reasons on the <i>primum mobile</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHU HÍ ON THE GREAT EXTREME.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Under the whole heaven there is no primary matter (<i>lí</i>) without the immaterial
principle (<i>kí</i>), and no immaterial principle apart from the primary matter.
Subsequent to the existence of the immaterial principle is produced
primary matter, which is deducible from the axiom that the one male and the
one female principle of nature may be denominated <i>tao</i> or <i>logos</i> (the active principle
from which all things emanate); thus nature is spontaneously possessed
of benevolence and righteousness (which are included in the idea of <i>tao</i>).</p>

<p>First of all existed <i>tien lí</i>, (the celestial principle or soul of the universe), and
then came primary matter; primary matter accumulated constituted <i>chih</i>
(body, substance, or the accidents and qualities of matter), and nature was
arranged.</p>

<p>Should any ask whether the immaterial principle or primary matter existed
first, I should say that the immaterial principle on assuming a figure ascended,
and primary matter on assuming form descended; when we come to speak of
assuming form and ascending or descending, how can we divest ourselves of
the idea of priority and subsequence? When the immaterial principle does
not assume a form, primary matter then becomes coarse, and forms a sediment.</p>

<p>Originally, however, no priority or subsequence can be predicated of the
immaterial principle and primary matter, and yet if you insist on carrying out
the reasoning to the question of their origin, then you must say that the immaterial
principle has the priority; but it is not a separate and distinct thing;
it is just contained in the centre of the primary matter, so that were there no
primary matter, then this immaterial principle would have no place of attachment.
Primary matter consists, in fact, of the four elements of metal, wood,
water, and fire, while the immaterial principle is no other than the four cardinal
virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom....</p>

<p>Should any one ask for an explanation of the assertion that the immaterial
principle has first existence, and after that comes primary matter, I say, it is
not necessary to speak thus: but when we know that they are combined, is it
that the immaterial principle holds the precedence, and the primary matter
the subsequence, or is it that the immaterial principle is subsequent to the
primary matter? We cannot thus carry our reasoning; but should we endeavor
to form some idea of it, then we may suppose that the primary matter
relies on the immaterial principle to come into action, and wherever the pri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>mary
matter is coagulated, there the immaterial principle is present. For the
primary matter can concrete and coagulate, act and do, but the immaterial
principle has neither will nor wish, plan nor operation: but only where the
primary matter is collected and coagulated, then the immaterial principle is in
the midst of it. Just as in nature, men and things, grass and trees, birds and
beasts, in their propagation invariably require seed, and certainly cannot without
seed from nothingness produce anything; all this, then, is the primary
matter, but the immaterial principle is merely a pure, empty, wide-stretched
void, without form or footstep, and incapable of action or creation; but the
primary matter can ferment and coagulate, collect and produce things....</p>

<p>Should any one ask, with regard to those expressions, “The Supreme Ruler
confers the due medium on the people, and when Heaven is about to send
down a great trust upon men, out of regard to the people it sets up princes
over them;” and, “Heaven in producing things treats them according to their
attainments: on those who do good, it sends down a hundred blessings, and
on those who do evil, a hundred calamities;” and, “When Heaven is about
to send down some uncommon calamity upon a generation, it first produces
some uncommon genius to determine it;” do these and such like expressions
imply that above the azure sky there is a Lord and Ruler who acts thus, or is
it still true that Heaven has no mind, and men only carry out their reasonings
in this style? I reply, these three things are but one idea; it is that the immaterial
principle of order is thus. The primary matter in its evolutions
hitherto, after one season of fulness has experienced one of decay; and after
a period of decline it again flourishes; just as if things were going on in a circle.
There never was a decay without a revival.</p>

<p>When men blow out their breath their bellies puff out, and when they inhale
their bellies sink in, while we should have thought that at each expiration
the stomach would fall in, and swell up at each inspiration; but the reason
of it is that when men expire, though the mouthful of breath goes out,
the second mouthful is again produced, therefore the belly is puffed up; and
when men inspire, the breath which is introduced from within drives the
other out, so that the belly sinks in. Lau-tsz’ said nature is like an open pipe
or bag; it moves, and yet is not compelled to stop, it is empty, and still more
comes out; just like a fan-case open at both ends....</p>

<p>The great extreme (<i>tai kih</i>) is merely the immaterial principle. It is not an
independent separate existence; it is found in the male and female principles
of nature, in the five elements, in all things; it is merely an immaterial principle,
and because of its extending to the extreme limit, is therefore called the
<i>great extreme</i>. If it were not for it, heaven and earth would not have been
set afloat.... From the time when the great extreme came into operation,
all things were produced by transformation. This one doctrine includes
the whole; it was not because this was first in existence and then that, but
altogether there is only one great origin, which from the substance extends to
the use, and from the subtle reaches to that which is manifest. Should one
ask, because all things partake of it, is the great extreme split up and divided?
I should reply, that originally there is only one great extreme (<i>anima mundi</i>),
of which all things partake, so that each one is provided with a great extreme;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span>
just as the moon in the heavens is only one, and yet is dispersed over the hills
and lakes, being seen from every place in succession; still you cannot say that
the moon is divided.</p>

<p>The great extreme has neither residence, nor form, nor place which you can
assign to it. If you speak of it before its development, then previous to that
emanation it was perfect stillness; motion and rest, with the male and female
principles of nature, are only the embodiment and descent of this principle.
Motion is the motion of the great extreme, and rest is its rest, but these same
motion and rest are not to be considered the great extreme itself....
Should any one ask, what is the great extreme? I should say, it is simply
the principle of extreme goodness and extreme perfection. Every man has a
great extreme, everything has one; that which Chao-tsz’ called the great extreme
is the exemplified virtue of everything that is extremely good and perfect
in heaven and earth, men and things.</p>

<p>The great extreme is simply the extreme point, beyond which one cannot
go; that which is most elevated, most mysterious, most subtle, and most divine,
beyond which there is no passing. Lienkí was afraid lest people should
think that the great extreme possessed form, and therefore called it the boundless
extreme, a principle centred in nothing, and having an infinite extent....
It is the immaterial principle of the two powers, the four forms,
and the eight changes of nature; we cannot say that it does not exist, and yet
no form or corporeity can be ascribed to it. From this point is produced the
one male and the one female principle of nature, which are called the dual
powers; the four forms and eight changes also proceed from this, all according
to a certain natural order, irrespective of human strength in its arrangement.
But from the time of Confucius no one has been able to get hold of
this idea.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p></div>

<p>And, it might be added, no one ever will be able to “get
hold” thereof. Such discussions as this have occupied the
minds and pens of Chinese metaphysicians for centuries, and in
their endeavors to explain the half-digested notions of the
<cite>Book of Changes</cite>, they have wandered far away from the road
which would have led them in the path of true knowledge,
namely, the observation and record of the works and operations
of nature around them; and one after another they have continued
to roll this stone of Sisyphus until fatigue and bewilderment
have come over them all. Some works on female education
are found in this section, which seems designed as much to
include whatever philosophers wrote as all they wrote on philosophy.</p>

<p>The second and third sections, on military and legal subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
contain no writings of any eminence. The isolation of the
Chinese prevented them from studying the various forms of
government and jurisprudence observed in other countries and
ages; it is this feature of originality which renders their legislation
so interesting to western students. Among the fourth,
on agricultural treatises, is the <cite>Kăng Chih Tu Shí</cite>, or ‘Plates
and Odes on Tillage and Weaving,’ a thin quarto, which was
written <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1210, and has been widely circulated by the present
government in order “to evince its regard for the people’s
support.” The first half contains twenty-three plates on the
various processes to be followed in raising rice, the last of which
represents the husbandmen and their families returning thanks
to the gods of the land for a good harvest, and offering a portion
of the fruits of the earth; the last plate in the second part
of the work also represents a similar scene of returning thanks
for a good crop of silk, and presenting an offering to the gods.
The drawings in this work are among the best for perspective
and general composition which Chinese art has produced;
probably their merit was the chief inducement to publish the
work at governmental expense, for the odes are too brief to
contain much information, and too difficult to be generally understood.
The <cite>Encyclopedia of Agriculture</cite>, by Sü Kwang-kí,
a high officer in 1600, better known as Paul Sü, gives a most
elaborate detail of farming operations and utensils existing in
the Ming. Other treatises on special topics and crops have
been written, but it is the untiring industry of the people which
secures to them the best returns from the soil, for they owe
very little to science or machinery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SACRED COMMANDS OF KANGHÍ.</div>

<p>Among the numerous writings published for the improvement
and instruction of the people by their rulers, none have
been more influential than the <cite>Shing Yu</cite>, or ‘Sacred Commands,’
a politico-moral treatise, which has been made known to English
readers by the translation of Dr. Milne.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The groundwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>
consists of sixteen apothegms, written by the Emperor Kanghí,
containing general rules for the peace, prosperity, and wealth
of all classes of his subjects. In order that none should plead
ignorance in excuse for not knowing the Sacred Commands, it
is by law required that they be proclaimed throughout the Empire
by the local officers on the first and fifteenth day of every
month, in a public hall set apart for the purpose, where the
people are not only permitted, but requested and encouraged,
to attend. In point of fact, however, this <i>political preaching</i>,
as it has been called, is neglected except in large towns, though
the design is not the less commendable. It is highly praiseworthy
to monarchs, secure in their thrones as Kanghí and
Yungching were, to take upon themselves the teaching of
morality to their subjects, and institute a special service every
fortnight to have their precepts communicated to them. If,
too, it should soon be seen that their designs had utterly failed
of all real good results from the mendacity of their officers and
the ignorance or opposition of the people, still the merit due
them is not diminished. The sixteen apothegms, each consisting
of seven characters, are as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>1. Pay just regard to filial and fraternal duties, in order to give due importance to the relations of life.</li>

<li>2. Respect kindred in order to display the excellence of harmony.</li>

<li>3. Let concord abound among those who dwell in the same neighborhood, thereby preventing litigations.</li>

<li>4. Give the chief place to husbandry and the culture of the mulberry, that adequate supplies of food and raiment be secured.</li>

<li>5. Esteem economy, that money be not lavishly wasted.</li>

<li>6. Magnify academical learning, in order to direct the scholar’s progress.</li>

<li>7. Degrade strange religions, in order to exalt the orthodox doctrines.</li>

<li>8. Explain the laws, in order to warn the ignorant and obstinate.</li>

<li>9. Illustrate the principles of a polite and yielding carriage, in order to improve manners.</li>

<li>10. Attend to the essential employments, in order to give unvarying determination to the will of the people.</li>

<li>11. Instruct the youth, in order to restrain them from evil.</li>

<li>12. Suppress all false accusing, in order to secure protection to the innocent.</li>

<li>13. Warn those who hide deserters, that they may not be involved in their downfall.</li>

<li>14. Complete the payment of taxes, in order to prevent frequent urging.</li>

<li>15. Unite the <i>pao</i> and <i>kia</i>, in order to extirpate robbery and theft.</li>

<li>16. Settle animosities, that lives may be duly valued.</li>

</ul>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR AMPLIFICATION BY YUNGCHING.</div>

<p>The amplifications of these maxims by Yungching contain
much information respecting the theory of his government, and
the position of the writer entitles him to speak from knowledge;
his amplification of the fourteenth maxim shows their character.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From of old the country was divided into districts, and a tribute paid proportioned
to the produce of the land. From hence arose revenues, upon
which the expense of the five <i>lí</i>, and the whole charges of government depended.
These expenses a prince must receive from the people, and they
are what inferiors should offer to superiors. Both in ancient and modern
times this principle has been the same and cannot be changed. Again, the
expenses of the salaries of magistrates that they may rule our people; of pay
to the army that they may protect them; of preparing for years of scarcity
that they may be fed; as all these are collected from the Empire, so they are
all employed for its use. How then can it be supposed that the granaries and
treasury of the sovereign are intended to injure the people that he may
nourish himself? Since the establishment of our dynasty till now, the proportions
of the revenue have been fixed by an universally approved statute,
and all unjust items completely cancelled; not a thread or hair too much has
been demanded from the people. In the days of our sacred Father, the Emperor
Pious, his abounding benevolence and liberal favor fed this people upward
of sixty years. Daily desirous to promote their abundance and happiness,
he greatly diminished the revenue, not limiting the reduction to hundreds,
thousands, myriads, or lacs of taels. The mean and the remote have experienced
his favor; even now it enters the muscles, and penetrates to the marrow.
To exact with moderation, diminish the revenue, and confer favors on
the multitude, are the virtues of a prince: to serve superiors, and to give the
first place to public service and second to their own, are the duties of a people.
Soldiers and people should all understand this. Become not lazy and trifling,
nor prodigally throw away your property. Linger not to pay in the revenue,
looking and hoping for some unusual occurrence to avoid it, nor entrust your
imposts to others, lest bad men appropriate them to their own use.</p>

<p>Pay in at the terms, and wait not to be urged. Then with the overplus
you can nourish your parents, complete the marriages of your children, satisfy
your daily wants, and provide for the annual feasts and sacrifices. District
officers may then sleep at ease in their public halls, and villagers will no longer
be vexed in the night by calls from the tax-gatherers; on neither hand will any
be involved. Your wives and children will be easy and at rest, than which
you have no greater joy. If unaware of the importance of the revenue to
government, and that the laws must be enforced, perhaps you will positively
refuse or deliberately put off the payment, when the magistrates, obliged to
balance their accounts, and give in their reports at stated times, must be rigorously
severe. The assessors, suffering the pain of the whip, cannot help
indulging their rapacious demands on you; knocking and pecking at your
doors like hungry hawks, they will devise numerous methods of getting their
wants supplied. These nameless ways of spending will probably amount to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>
more than the sum which ought to have been paid, and that sum, after all,
cannot be dispensed with.</p>

<p>We know not what benefit can accrue from this. Rather than give presents
to satisfy the rapacity of policemen, how much better to clear off the just
assessments! Rather than prove an obstinate race and refuse the payment of
the revenue, would it not be better to keep the law? Every one, even the
most stupid, knows this. Furthermore, when superiors display benevolence,
inferiors should manifest justice; this belongs to the idea of their being one
body. Reflect that the constant labors and cares of the palace are all to serve
the people. When freshes occur, dikes must be raised to restrain them; if
the demon of drought appear, prayer must be offered for rain: when the
locusts come, they must be destroyed. If the calamities be averted, you reap
the advantage; but if they overwhelm you, your taxes are forborne, and alms
liberally expended for you. If it be thus, and the people still can suffer
themselves to evade the payment of taxes and hinder the supply of government,
how, I ask, can you be easy? Such conduct is like that of an undutiful
son. We use these repeated admonitions, only wishing you, soldiers and
people, to think of the army and nation, and also of your persons and families.
Then abroad you will have the fame of faithfulness, and at home
peacefully enjoy its fruits. Officers will not trouble you, nor their clerks vex
you&mdash;what joy equal to this! O soldiers and people, meditate on these things
in the silent night, and let all accord with our wishes.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote">WANG YU-PÍ’S RIDICULE OF BUDDHISM.</div>

<p>Wang Yu-pí, a high officer under Yungching, paraphrased
the amplifications in a colloquial manner. His remarks on the
doctrines of the Buddhists and Rationalists will serve as an
illustration; the quotation here given is found under the seventh
maxim.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You simple people know not how to discriminate; for even according to
what the books of Buddha say, he was the first-born son of the king Fan; but,
retiring from the world, he fled away alone to the top of the Snowy Mountains,
in order to cultivate virtue. If he regarded not his own father, mother, wife,
and children, are you such fools as to suppose that he regards the multitude
of the living, or would deliver his laws and doctrines to you? The imperial
residence, the queen’s palace, the dragon’s chamber, and halls of state&mdash;if he
rejected these, is it not marvellous to suppose that he should delight in the
nunneries, monasteries, temples, and religious houses which you can build for
him? As to the Gemmeous Emperor, the most honorable in heaven, if there
be indeed such a god, it is strange to think he should not enjoy himself at his
own ease in the high heavens, but must have you to give him a body of molten
gold, and build him a house to dwell in!</p>

<p>All these nonsensical tales about keeping fasts, collecting assemblies,
building temples, and fashioning images, are feigned by those sauntering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span>
worthless priests and monks to deceive you. Still you believe them, and not
only go yourselves to worship and burn incense in the temples, but also suffer
your wives and daughters to go. With their hair oiled and faces painted,
dressed in scarlet and trimmed with green, they go to burn incense in the
temples, associating with the priests of Buddha, doctors of Reason and bare-stick
attorneys, touching shoulders, rubbing arms, and pressed in the moving
crowd. I see not where the good they talk of doing is; on the contrary,
they do many shameful things that create vexation, and give people occasion
for laughter and ridicule.</p>

<p>Further, there are some persons who, fearing that their good boys and
girls may not attain to maturity, take and give them to the temples to become
priests and priestesses of Buddha and Reason, supposing that after having removed
them from their own houses and placed them at the foot of grandfather
Fuh (Buddha), they are then sure of prolonging life! Now, I would ask you
if those who in this age are priests of these sects, all reach the age of seventy
or eighty, and if there is not a short-lived person among them?</p>

<p>Again, there is another very stupid class of persons who, because their
parents are sick, pledge their own persons by a vow before the gods that if
their parents be restored to health, they will worship and burn incense
on the hills, prostrating themselves at every step till they arrive at the summit,
whence they will dash themselves down! If they do not lose their lives,
they are sure to break a leg or an arm. They say to themselves, “To give
up our own lives to save our parents is the highest display of filial duty.”
Bystanders also praise them as dutiful children, but they do not consider that
to slight the bodies received from their parents in this manner discovers an
extreme want of filial duty.</p>

<p>Moreover, you say that serving Fuh is a profitable service; that if you
burn paper money, present offerings, and keep fasts before the face of your
god Fuh, he will dissipate calamities, blot out your sins, increase your happiness,
and prolong your age! Now reflect: from of old it has been said, “The
gods are intelligent and just.” Were Buddha a god of this description, how
could he avariciously desire your gilt paper, and your offerings to engage him
to afford you protection? If you do not burn gilt paper to him, and spread
offerings on his altar, the god Fuh will be displeased with you, and send down
judgments on you! Then your god Fuh is a scoundrel! Take, for example,
the district magistrate. Should you never go to compliment and flatter him,
yet, if you are good people and attend to your duty, he will pay marked attention
to you. But transgress the law, commit violence, or usurp the rights
of others, and though you should use a thousand ways and means to flatter
him, he will still be displeased with you, and will, without fail, remove such
pests from society.</p>

<p>You say that worshipping Fuh atones for your sins. Suppose you have
violated the law, and are hauled to the judgment-seat to be punished; if you
should bawl out several thousand times, “O your excellency! O your excellency!”
do you think the magistrate would spare you? You will, however,
at all risks, invite several Buddhist and Rationalist priests to your houses to recite
their canonical books and make confession, supposing that to chant their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>
mummery drives away misery, secures peace, and prolongs happiness and life.
But suppose you rest satisfied with merely reading over the sections of these
Sacred Commands several thousands or myriads of times without acting conformably
thereto; would it not be vain to suppose that his Imperial Majesty
should delight in you, reward you with money, and promote you to office?<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p></div>

<p>This ridicule of the popular superstitions has, no doubt, had
some effect, repeated as it is in all parts of the country; but
since the literati merely tear down and build up nothing, giving
the people no substitute for what they take away, but rather,
in their times of trouble, doing the things they decry, such
homilies do not destroy the general respect for such ceremonies.
The <cite>Shing Yu</cite> has also been versified for the benefit of children,
and colloquial explanations added, which has further
tended to enforce and inculcate its admonitions. The praise
bestowed on this work by Johnson, in his <cite>Oriental Religions</cite>,
has a good degree of actual usefulness among the people to
confirm his observations; yet they are quite used to hearing
the highest moral platitudes from their rulers, to whom they
would not lend a dollar on their word.</p>

<p>In the fifth section, on medical writings, separate works are
mentioned on the treatment of all domestic animals; among
them is one on veterinary surgery, whose writers have versified
most of their observations and prescriptions. The <cite>Herbal</cite> of
Lí Shí-chin, noticed on p. <a href="#Page_370">370</a>, and monographs on special diseases,
all show the industry of Chinese physicians to much better
advantage than their science. Works on medicine and
surgery are numerous, in which the surface of the body is
minutely represented in pictures, together with drawings of
the mode of performing various operations. Works on judicial
astrology, chiromancy, and other modes of divination, on the
rules for finding lucky spots for houses, graves, and temples,
are exceedingly numerous, a large number of them written by
Rationalists.</p>

<p>The eighth section, on art, contains writings on painting,
music, engraving, writing, posturing, and archery, and they will
doubtless furnish many new points to western artists on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
principles and attainments of the Chinese in these branches
when the works have been made better known.</p>

<p>The ninth section, entitled ‘Collections’ or ‘Repertories,’ is
divided into memoirs on antiques, swords, coins, and bronzes,
and presents a field of interesting research to a foreign archæologist
likely to reward him. Another division, containing the
monographs on tea, bamboo, floriculture, etc., is not so promising.</p>

<p>The tenth section, on philosophical writings, having a tinge of
heterodoxy, is a very large one, and offers a rare opportunity of
research to those curious to know what China can contribute to
moral science. The writings of Roman Catholics and Moslems
are included in this long catalogue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CYCLOPÆDIAS, NOVELS, ETC.</div>

<p>Under the head of encyclopædias, a list of summaries, compends,
and treasuries of knowledge is given, which for extent
and bulkiness cannot be equalled in any language. Among
them is the <cite>Tai Tien</cite>, or ‘Great Record’ of the Emperor Yungloh
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1403), in twenty-two thousand eight hundred and
seventy-seven chapters, and containing the substance of all classical,
historical, philosophical, and scientific writings in the language.
Parts of this compilation were lost, and on the accession
of the Manchus one-tenth of it was missing; but by means
of the unequalled interest on the part of Yungloh in his
national literature, three hundred and eighty-five ancient and
rare works were rescued from destruction. The <cite>San Tsai Tu</cite>,
or ‘Plates [illustrative of the] Three Powers’ (<i>i.e.</i>, heaven,
earth, and man, by which is meant the entire universe), in one
hundred and thirty volumes, is one of the most valuable compilations,
by reason of the great number of plates it contains,
which exhibit the ideas of the compilers much better than their
descriptions.</p>

<p>The twelfth section, containing novels and tales, called <cite>Siao
Shwoh</cite>, or ‘Trifling Talk,’ gives the titles of but few of the
thousands of productions of this class in the language. Works
of fiction are among the most popular and exceptionable books
the Chinese have, and those which are not demoralizing are,
with some notable exceptions, like the <cite>Ten Talented Authors</cite>,
generally slighted. The books sold in the streets are chiefly
of this class of writings, consisting of tales and stories generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[693]</a></span>
destitute of all intricacy of plot, fertility of illustration, or elevation
of sentiment. They form the common mental aliment
of the lower classes, being read by those who are able, and
talked about by all; their influence is consequently immense.
Many of them are written in the purest style, among which a
collection called <cite>Liao Chai</cite>, or ‘Pastimes of the Study,’ in sixteen
volumes, is pre-eminent for its variety and force of expression,
and its perusal can be recommended to every one who
wishes to study the copiousness of the Chinese language. The
preface is dated in 1679; most of the tales are short, and few
have any ostensible moral to them, while those which are objectionable
for their immorality, or ridiculous from their magic
whimsies, form a large proportion. A quotation or two will
illustrate the author’s invention:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A villager was once selling plums in the market, which were rather delicious
and fragrant, and high in price; and there was a Tao priest, clad in
ragged garments of coarse cotton, begging before his wagon. The villager
scolded him, but he would not go off; whereupon, becoming angry, he reviled
and hooted at him. The priest said, “The wagon contains many hundred
plums, and I have only begged one of them, which, for you, respected sir,
would certainly be no great loss; why then are you so angry?” The spectators
advised to give him a poor plum and send him away, but the villager
would not consent. The workmen in the market disliking the noise and
clamor, furnished a few coppers and bought a plum, which they gave the
priest. He bowing thanked them, and turning to the crowd said, “I do not
wish to be stingy, and request you, my friends, to partake with me of this
delicious plum.” One of them replied, “Now you have it, why do you not eat
it yourself?” “I want only the stone to plant,” said he, eating it up at a
munch. When eaten, he held the stone in his hand, and taking a spade off
his shoulder, dug a hole in the ground several inches deep, into which he put
it and covered it with earth. Then turning to the market people, he procured
some broth with which he watered and fertilized it; and others, wishing to
see what would turn up, brought him boiling dregs from shops near by, which
he poured upon the hole just dug. Every one’s eyes being fixed upon the
spot, they saw a crooked shoot issuing forth, which gradually increased till it
became a tree, having branches and leaves; flowers and then fruit succeeded,
large and very fragrant, which covered the tree. The priest then approached
the tree, plucked the fruit and gave the beholders; and when all were consumed,
he felled the tree with a colter&mdash;chopping, chopping for a good while,
until at last, having cut it off, he shouldered the foliage in an easy manner,
and leisurely walked away.</p>

<p>When first the priest began to perform his magic arts, the villager was
also among the crowd, with outstretched neck and gazing eyes, and completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[694]</a></span>
forgot his own business. When the priest had gone, he began to look into
his wagon, and lo! it was empty of plums; and for the first time he perceived
that what had just been distributed were all his own goods. Moreover, looking
narrowly about his wagon, he saw that the dashboard was gone, having
just been cut off with a chisel. Much excited and incensed he ran after him,
and as he turned the corner of the wall, he saw the board thrown down beneath
the hedge, it being that with which the plum-tree was felled. Nobody
knew where the priest had gone, and all the market folks laughed heartily.</p></div>

<p>The Rationalists are considered as the chief magicians among
the Chinese, and they figure in most of the tales in this work,
whose object probably was to exalt their craft, and add to their
reputation. Like the foregoing against hardheartedness, the
following contains a little sidewise admonition against theft:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the west of the city in the hamlet of the White family lived a rustic
who stole his neighbor’s duck and cooked it. At night he felt his skin itch,
and on looking at it in the morning saw a thick growth of duck’s feathers,
which, when irritated, pained him. He was much alarmed, for he had no
remedy to cure it; but, in a dream of the night, a man informed him, “Your
disease is a judgment from heaven; you must get the loser to reprimand you,
and the feathers will fall off.” Now this gentleman, his neighbor, was always
liberal and courteous, nor during his whole life, whenever he lost anything,
had he even manifested any displeasure in his countenance. The thief
craftily told him, “The fellow who stole your duck is exceedingly afraid of a
reprimand; but reprove him, and he will no doubt then fear in future.” He,
laughing, replied, “Who has the time or disposition to scold wicked men?” and
altogether refused to do so; so the man, being hardly bestead, was obliged to
tell the truth, upon which the gentleman gave him a scolding, and his disorder
was removed.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF CHINESE FICTION.</div>

<p>Rémusat compares the construction of Chinese novels to those
of Richardson, in which the “authors render their characters
interesting and natural by reiterated strokes of the pencil, which
finally produce a high degree of illusion. The interest in their
pages arose precisely in proportion to the stage of my progress;
and in approaching to the termination, I found myself about to
part with some agreeable people, just as I had duly learned to
relish their society.” He briefly describes the defects in Chinese
romances as principally consisting in long descriptions of trifling
particulars and delineations of localities, and the characters and
circumstances of the interlocutors, while the thread of the narrative
is carried on mostly in a conversational way, which, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span>
its minuteness, soon becomes tedious. The length of their
poetic descriptions and prolix display of the wonders of art or
the beauties of nature, thrown in at the least hint in the narrative,
or moral reflections introduced in the most serious manner
in the midst of diverting incidents, like a long-metre psalm in
a comedy, tend to confuse the main story and dislocate the unity
requisite to produce an effect.</p>

<p>Chinese novels, however, generally depend on something of
a plot, and the characters are sometimes well sustained. “Visits
and the formalities of polished statesmen; assemblies, and above
all, the conversations which make them agreeable; repasts, and
the social amusements which prolong them; walks of the admirers
of beautiful nature; journeys; the manœuvres of adventurers;
lawsuits; the literary examinations; and, in the
sequel, marriage, form their most frequent episodes and ordinary
conclusions.” The hero of these plots is usually a young academician,
endowed with an amiable disposition and devotedly
attached to the study of classic authors, who meets with every
kind of obstacle and ill luck in the way of attaining the literary
honors he has set his heart on. The heroine is also well acquainted
with letters; her own inclinations and her father’s
desires are that she may find a man of suitable accomplishments,
but after having heard of one, every sort of difficulty is
thrown in the way of getting him; which, of course, on the
part of both are at last happily surmounted.</p>

<p>The adventures which distinguished persons meet in wandering
over the country incognito, and the happy dénouement of
their interviews with some whom they have been able to elevate
when their real characters have been let out, form the plan of
other tales. There is little or nothing of high wrought description
of passion, nor acts of atrocious vengeance introduced to
remove a troublesome person, but everything is kept within the
bounds of probability; and at the end the vicious are punished
by seeing their bad designs fail of their end in the rewards and
success given those who have done well. In most of the stories
whose length and style are such as to entitle them to the name
of novel, and which have attained any reputation, the story is
not disgraced by anything offensive; it is rather in the shorter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span>
tales that decency is violated. Among them the <cite>Hung Lao
Mung</cite>, or ‘Dreams of the Red Chamber,’ is one of the most
popular stories, and open not a little to this objection.</p>

<p>The historical novels, of which there are many, would, if
translated, prove more interesting to foreign readers than those
merely describing manners, because they interweave much information
in the story. The <cite>Shui Hu Chuen</cite>, or ‘Narrative
of the Water Marshes,’ and ‘The Annals of the Contending
States,’ are two of the best written; the latter is more credible
as a history than any other work in this class.</p>

<p>The fourth division of the Catalogue is called <cite>Tsih Pu</cite>, or
‘Miscellanies,’ and the works mentioned in it are chiefly poems
or collections of songs, occupying nearly one-third of the whole
collection. They are arranged in five sections, namely: Poetry
of Tsu, Complete Works of Individuals, and General Collections,
On the Art of Poetry, and Odes and Songs. The most
ancient poet in the language is Yuh Yuen, a talented Minister
of State who flourished previous to the time of Mencius, and
wrote the <cite>Lí Sao</cite>, or ‘Dissipation of Sorrows.’ It has been
translated into German and French. His name and misfortunes
are still commemorated by the Festival of Dragon-boats
on the fifth day of the fifth moon. More celebrated in Chinese
estimation are the poets Lí Tai-peh and Tu Fu of the Tang
dynasty, and Su Tung-po of the Sung, who combined the three
leading traits of a bard, being lovers of flowers, wine, and song,
and attaining distinction in the service of government.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> The
incidents in the life of the former of these bards were so varied,
and his reckless love of drink brought him into so many scrapes,
that he is no less famed for his adventures than for his sonnets.
The following story is told of him in the ‘Remarkable Facts
of all Times,’ which is here abridged from the translation of
T. Pavié:</p>

<div class="sidenote">STORY OF LÍ TAI-PEH, THE POET.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lí, called <i>Tai-peh</i>, or ‘Great-white,’ from the planet Venus, was endowed
with a beautiful countenance and a well-made person, exhibiting in all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span>
movements a gentle nobility which indicated a man destined to rise above his
age. When only ten years old, he could read the classics and histories, and
his conversation showed the brilliancy of his thoughts, as well as the purity
of his diction. He was, in consequence of his precocity, called the Exiled
Immortal, but named himself the Retired Scholar of the Blue Lotus. Some
one having extolled the quality of the wine of Niauching, he straightway
went there, although more than three hundred miles distant, and abandoned
himself to his appetite for liquor. While singing and carousing in a tavern,
a military commandant passed, who, hearing his song, sent in to inquire who
it was, and carried the poet off to his own house. On departing, he urged Lí
to go to the capital and compete for literary honors, which, he doubted not,
could be easily attained, and at last induced him to bend his steps to the capital.
On his arrival there, he luckily met the academician Ho near the palace,
who invited him to an alehouse, and laying aside his robes, drank wine with
him till night, and then carried him home. The two were soon well acquainted,
and discussed the merits of poetry and wine till they were much charmed with
each other.</p>

<p>As the day of examination approached, Ho gave the poet some advice.
“The examiners for this spring are Yang and Kao, one a brother of the Empress,
the other commander of his Majesty’s body-guard; both of them love
those who make them presents, and if you have no means to buy their favor,
the road of promotion will be shut to you. I know them both very well, and
will write a note to each of them, which may, perhaps, obtain you some
favor.” In spite of his merit and high reputation, Lí found himself in such
circumstances as to make it desirable to avail of the good-will of his friend
Ho; but on perusing the notes he brought, the examiners disdainfully exclaimed,
“After having fingered his <i>protégé’s</i> money, the academician contents
himself with sending us a billet which merely rings its sound, and bespeaks
our attention and favors toward an upstart without degree or title. On the
day of decision we will remember the name of Lí, and any composition signed
by him shall be thrown aside without further notice.” The day of examination
came, and the distinguished scholars of the Empire assembled, eager to
hand in their compositions. Lí, fully capable to go through the trial, wrote
off his essay on a sheet without effort, and handed it in first. As soon as he
saw the name of Lí, the examiner Yang did not even give himself time to
glance over the page, but with long strokes of his pencil erased the composition,
saying, “Such a scrawler as this is good for nothing but to grind my ink!”
“To grind your ink!” interrupted the other examiner Kao; “say rather he is
only fit to put on my stockings, and lace up my buskins.”</p>

<p>With these pleasantries, the essay of Lí was rejected; but he, transported
with anger at such a contemptuous refusal at the public examination, returned
home and exclaimed, “I swear that if ever my wishes for promotion are accomplished,
I will order Yang to grind my ink, and Kao to put on my stockings
and lace up my buskins; then my vows will be accomplished.” Ho
endeavored to calm the indignation of the poet: “Stay here with me till a
new examination is ordered in three years, and live in plenty; the examiners
will not be the same then, and you will surely succeed.” They therefore
continued to live as they had done, drinking and making verses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span></p>

<p>After many months had elapsed, some foreign ambassadors came to the
capital charged with a letter from their sovereign, whom he was ordered to
receive and entertain in the hall of ambassadors. The next day the officers
handed in their letter to his Majesty’s council, who ordered the doctors to open
and read it, but they could none of them decipher a single word, humbly declaring
it contained nothing but fly-tracks; “your subjects,” they added,
“have only a limited knowledge, a shallow acquaintance with things; they are
unable to read a word.” On hearing this, the Emperor turned to the examiner
Yang and ordered him to read the letter, but his eyes wandered over the
characters as if he had been blind, and he knew nothing of them. In vain
did his Majesty address himself to the civil and military officers who filled the
court; not one among them could say whether the letter contained words of
good or evil import. Highly incensed, he broke out in reproaches against the
grandees of his palace: “What! among so many magistrates, so many scholars
and warriors, cannot there be found a single one who knows enough to relieve
us of the vexation of this affair? If this letter cannot be read, how can it be
answered? If the ambassadors are dismissed in this style, we shall be the
ridicule of the barbarians, and foreign kings will mock the court of Nanking,
and doubtless follow it up by seizing their lance and buckler and join to invade
our frontiers. What then? If in three days no one is able to decipher this
letter, every one of your appointments shall be suspended; if in six days you
do not tell me what it means, your offices shall every one be taken away; and
death shall execute justice on such ignorant men if I wait nine days in vain
for its explanation, and others of our subjects shall be elevated to power whose
virtue and talents will render some service to their country.”</p>

<p>Terrified by these words, the grandees kept a mournful silence, and no one
ventured a single reply, which only irritated the monarch the more. On his
return home, Ho related to his friend Lí everything that had transpired at
court, who, hearing him with a mournful smile, replied, “How to be regretted,
how unlucky it is that I could not obtain a degree at the examination last
year, which would have given me a magistracy; for now, alas! it is impossible
for me to relieve his Majesty of the chagrin which troubles him.” “But
truly,” said Ho, suddenly, “I think you are versed in more than one science,
and will be able to read this unlucky letter. I shall go to his Majesty and
propose you on my own responsibility.” The next day he went to the
palace, and passing through the crowd of courtiers, approached the throne,
saying, “Your subject presumes to announce to your Majesty that there is a
scholar of great merit called Lí, at his house, who is profoundly acquainted
with more than one science; command him to read this letter, for there is
nothing of which he is not capable.”</p>

<p>This advice pleased the Emperor, who presently sent a messenger to the
house of the academician, ordering him to present himself at court. But Lí
offered some objections: “I am a man still without degree or title; I have
neither talents nor information, while the court abounds in civil and military
officers, all equally famous for their profound learning. How then can you
have recourse to such a contemptible and useless man as I? If I presume to
accept this behest, I fear that I shall deeply offend the nobles of the palace”&mdash;referring
especially to the premier Yang and the general Kao. When his reply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
was announced to the Emperor, he demanded of Ho why his guest did not
come when ordered. Ho replied, “I can assure your Majesty that Lí is a man
of parts beyond all those of the age, one whose compositions astonish all who
read them. At the trial of last year, his essay was marked out and thrown
aside by the examiners, and he himself shamefully put out of the hall. Your
Majesty now calling him to court, and he having neither title nor rank, his
self-love is touched; but if your Majesty would hear your minister’s prayer,
and shed your favors upon his friend, and send a high officer to him, I am
sure he will hasten to obey the imperial will.” “Let it be so,” rejoined the
Emperor; “at the instance of our academician, we confer on Lí Peh the title
of doctor of the first rank, with the purple robe, yellow girdle, and silken
bonnet; and herewith also issue an order for him to present himself at court.
Our academician Ho will charge himself with carrying this order, and bring
Lí Peh to our presence without fail.”</p>

<p>Ho returned home to Lí, and begged him to go to court to read the letter,
adding how his Majesty depended on his help to relieve him from his present
embarrassment. As soon as he had put on his new robes, which were those
of a high examiner, he made his obeisance toward the palace, and hastened to
mount his horse and enter it, following after the academician. Seated on his
throne, Hwantsung impatiently awaited the arrival of the poet, who, prostrating
himself before its steps, went through the ceremony of salutation and
acknowledgment for the favors he had received, and then stood in his place.
The Emperor, as soon as he saw Lí, rejoiced as poor men do on finding a treasure,
or starvelings on sitting at a loaded table; his heart was like dark clouds
suddenly illuminated, or parched and arid soil on the approach of rain. “Some
foreign ambassadors have brought us a letter which no one can read, and we
have sent for you, doctor, to relieve our anxiety.” “Your minister’s knowledge
is very limited,” politely replied Lí, with a bow, “for his essay was rejected by
the judges at the examination, and lord Kao turned him out of doors. Now
that he is called upon to read this letter from a foreign prince, how is it that
the examiners are not charged with the answer, since, too, the ambassadors
have already been kept so long waiting? Since I, a student turned off from
the trial, could not satisfy the wishes of the examiners, how can I hope to
meet the expectation of your Majesty?” “We know what you are good for,”
said the Emperor; “a truce to your excuses,” putting the letter into his hands.
Running his eyes over it, he disdainfully smiled, and standing before the
throne, read off in Chinese the mysterious letter, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Letter from the mighty Ko To of the kingdom of Po Hai to the prince
of the dynasty of Tang: Since your usurpation of Corea, and carrying your
conquests to the frontiers of our States, your soldiers have violated our territory
in frequent raids. We trust you can fully explain to us this matter, and as we
cannot patiently bear such a state of things, we have sent our ambassadors to
announce to you that you must give up the hundred and sixty-six towns of
Corea into our hands. We have some precious things to offer you in compensation,
namely, the medicinal plants from the mountains of Tai Peh, and the
byssus from the southern sea, gongs of Tsíching, stags from Fuyu, and horses
from Sopin, silk of Wuchau, black fish from the river Meito, prunes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
Kiutu, and building materials from Loyu; some of all these articles shall be
sent you. If you do not accept these propositions, we shall raise troops and
carry war and destruction into your borders, and then see on whose side victory
will remain.”</p></div>

<p>After its perusal, to which they had given an attentive ear, the grandees
were stupefied and looked at each other, knowing how improbable it was that
the Emperor would accept the propositions of Ko To. Nor was the mind of
his Majesty by any means satisfied, and after remaining silent for some time,
he turned himself to the civil and military officers about him, and asked what
means were available to repulse the attacks of the barbarians in case their
forces invaded Corea. Scholars and generals remained mute as idols of clay
or statues of wood; no one said a word, until Ho ventured to observe, “Your
venerable grandfather Taitsung, in three expeditions against Corea, lost an untold
number of soldiers, without succeeding in his enterprise, and impoverished
his treasury. Thanks to Heaven Kai-su-wăn died, and profiting by the
dissensions between the usurper’s sons, the glorious Emperor Taitsung confided
the direction of a million of veterans to the old generals Lí Sié and Pí Jin-kwei,
who, after a hundred engagements, more or less important, finally conquered
the kingdom. But now having been at peace for a long time, we have
neither generals nor soldiers; if we seize the buckler and lance, it will not be
easy to resist, and our defeat will be certain. I await the wise determination
of your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“Since such is the case, what answer shall we make to the ambassadors?”
said Hwantsung. “Deign to ask Lí,” said the doctor; “he will speak to the
purpose.” On being interrogated by his sovereign, Lí replied, “Let not this
matter trouble your clear mind. Give orders for an audience to the ambassadors,
and I will speak to them face to face in their own language. The terms
of the answer will make the barbarians blush, and their Ko To will be obliged
to make his respects at the foot of your throne.” “And who is this Ko To?”
demanded Hwantsung. “It is the name the people of Po Hai give to their
king after the usage of their country; just as the Hwui Hwui call theirs Kokan;
the Tibetans, Tsangpo; the Lochau, Chau; the Holing, Sí-mo-wei: each one
according to the custom of his nation.”</p>

<p>At this rapid flood of explanations, the mind of the wise Hwantsung experienced
a lively joy, and the same day he honored Lí with the title of an
academician; a lodging was prepared for him in the palace of the Golden
Bell; musicians made the place re-echo with their harmony; women poured
out the wine, and young girls handed him the goblets, and celebrated the
glory of Lí with the same voices that lauded the Emperor. What a delicious,
ravishing banquet! He could hardly keep within the limits of propriety, but
ate and drank until he was unconscious of anything, when the Emperor ordered
the attendants to carry him into the palace and lay him on a bed.</p>

<p>The next morning, when the gong announced the fifth watch, the Emperor
repaired to the hall of audience; but Lí’s faculties, on awaking, were
not very clear, though the officers hastened to bring him. When all had gone
through their prostrations, Hwantsung called the poet near him, but perceiving
that the visage of the new-made doctor still bore the marks of his debauch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span>
and discovering the discomposure of his mind, he sent into the kitchen for a
little wine and some well-spiced fish broth, to arouse the sleepy bard. The
servants presently sent it up on a golden tray, and the Emperor seeing the cup
was fuming, condescended to stir and cool the broth a long time with the ivory
chopsticks, and served it out himself to Lí, who, receiving it on his knees, ate
and drank, while a pleasing joy illumined his countenance. While this was
going on, some among the courtiers were much provoked and displeased at the
strange familiarity, while others rejoiced to see how well the Emperor knew to
conciliate the good will of men. The two examiners, Yang and Kao, betrayed
in their features the dislike they felt.</p>

<p>At the command of the Emperor, the ambassadors were introduced, and
saluted his Majesty by acclamation, whilst Lí Tai-peh, clad in a purple robe
and silken bonnet, easy and gracious as an immortal, stood in the historiographer’s
place before the left of the throne, holding the letter in his hand, and
read it off in a clear tone, without mistaking a word. Then turning toward
the frightened envoys, he said, “Your little province has failed in its etiquette,
but our wise ruler, whose power is comparable to the heavens for vastness, disdains
to take advantage of it. This is the answer which he grants you: hear
and be silent.” The terrified ambassadors fell trembling at the foot of the
throne. The Emperor had already prepared near him an ornamented cushion,
and taking a jade stone with which to rub the ink, a pencil of leveret’s hair
bound in an ivory tube, a cake of perfumed ink, and a sheet of flowery paper,
gave them to Lí, and seated him on the cushion ready to draw up the answer.</p>

<p>“May it please your Majesty,” objected Lí, “my boots are not at all suitable,
for they were soiled at the banquet last evening, and I trust your Majesty in
your generosity will grant me some new buskins and stockings fit for ascending
the platform.” The Emperor acceded to his request, and ordered a servant
to procure them; when Lí resumed, “Your minister has still a word to add,
and begs beforehand that his untoward conduct may be excused; then he will
prefer his request.” “Your notions are misplaced and useless, but I will not
be offended at them; go on, speak,” said Hwantsung; to which Lí, nothing
daunted, said, “At the last examination, your minister was turned off by Yang,
and put out of doors by Kao. The sight of these persons here to-day at the
head of the courtiers casts a certain discomposure over his spirits; let your
voice deign to command Yang to rub my ink, whilst Kao puts on my stockings
and laces up my buskins; then will my mind and wits begin to recover
their energies, and my pencil can trace your answer in the language of the
foreigners. In transmitting the reply in the name of the Son of Heaven, he
will then not disappoint the confidence with which he is honored.” Afraid to
displease Lí when he had need of him, the Emperor gave the strange order; and
while Yang rubbed the ink and Kao put on the buskins of the poet, they
could not help reflecting, that this student, so badly received and treated by
them, only fit at the best to render such services to them, availed himself now
of the sudden favors of the Emperor to take their own words pronounced
against him as a text, and revenge himself upon them for past injuries. But
what could they do? They could not oppose the sovereign will, and if they
did feel chagrined, they did not dare at least to express it. The proverb hath
it true:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[702]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do not draw upon you a person’s enmity, for enmity is never appeased;
injury returns upon him who injures, and sharp words recoil against him who
says them.”</p>

<p>The poet triumphed, and his oath was accomplished. Buskined as he desired,
he mounted the platform on the carpet and seated himself on the cushion,
while Yang stood at his side and rubbed the ink. Of a truth, the disparity
was great between an ink-grinder and the magnate who counselled the Emperor.
But why did the poet sit while the premier stood like a servant at his
side? It was because Lí was the organ of the monarch’s words, while Yang,
reduced to act the part of an ink-rubber, could not request permission to sit.
With one hand Lí stroked his beard, and seizing his pencil in the other, applied
it to the paper, which was soon covered with strange characters, well turned and
even without a fault or rasure, and then laid it upon the dragon’s table. The
Emperor gazed at it in amaze, for it was identical with that of the barbarians;
not a character in it resembled the Chinese; and as he handed it about among
the nobles, their surprise was great. When requested to read it, Lí, placed
before the throne, read in a clear loud tone the answer to the strangers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The mighty Emperor of the Tang dynasty, whose reign is called Kiayuen,
sends his instructions to Ko To of the Po Hai.</p>

<p>“From ancient times the rock and the egg have not hit each other, nor
the serpent and dragon made war. Our dynasty, favored by fate, extends
its power, and reigns even to the four seas; it has under its orders brave
generals and tried soldiers, solid bucklers and glittering swords. Your neighbor,
King Hiehlí, who refused our alliance, was taken prisoner; but the
people of Putsau, after offering a present of a metal bird, took an oath of
obedience.</p>

<p>“The Sinlo, at the southern end of Corea, have sent us praises written on the
finest tissues of silk; Persia, serpents which can catch rats; India, birds that
can speak; and Rome, dogs which lead horses, holding a lantern in their
mouth; the white parrot is a present from the kingdom of Koling, the carbuncle
which illumines the night comes from Cambodia, and famous horses
are sent by the tribe of Kolí, while precious vases are brought from Níal: in
short, there is not a nation which does not respect our imposing power, and
does not testify their regard for the virtue which distinguishes us. Corea
alone resisted the will of Heaven, but the divine vengeance has fallen heavily
upon it, and a kingdom which reckoned nine centuries of duration was overthrown
as in a morning. Why, then, do you not profit by the terrible
prognostics Heaven vouchsafes you as examples? Would it not evince your
sagacity?</p>

<p>“Moreover, your little country, situated beyond the peninsula, is little
more than as a province of Corea, or as a principality to the Celestial Empire;
your resources in men and horses are not a millionth part those of China.
You are like a chafed locust trying to stop a chariot, like a stiff-necked goose
which will not submit. Under the arms of our warriors your blood will run
a thousand <i>lí</i>. You, prince, resemble that audacious one who refused our
alliance, and whose kingdom became annexed to Corea. The designs of our
sage Emperor are vast as the ocean, and he now bears with your culpable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[703]</a></span>
unreasonable conduct; but hasten to prevent misfortune by repentance, and
cheerfully pay the tribute of each year, and you will prevent the shame and
opprobrium which will cover you and expose you to the ridicule of your neighbors.
Reflect thrice on these instructions.”</p></div>

<p>The reading of this answer filled the Emperor with joy, who ordered Lí
to make known its contents to the ambassadors; he then sealed it with the
imperial seal. The poet called Kao to put on the boots which he had taken off,
and he then returned to the palace of Golden Bells to inform the envoys concerning
his sovereign’s orders, reading the letter to them in a loud tone, while
they heard tremblingly. The academician Ho reconducted them to the gates
of the capital, and there the ambassadors asked who it was who had read the
imperial instructions. “He is called Lí, and has the title of Doctor of the
Hanlin.” “But among so many dignitaries, why did the first Minister of State
rub his ink, and the general of the guards lace up his buskins?” “Hear,”
added Ho; “those two personages are indeed intimate ministers of his Majesty,
but they are only noble courtiers who do not transcend common humanity,
while Doctor Lí, on the contrary, is an immortal descended from heaven on
the earth to aid the sovereign of the Celestial Empire. How can any one equal
him?” The ambassadors bowed the head and departed, and on their return
rendered an account of their mission to their sovereign. On reading the answer
of Lí, the Ko To was terrified, and deliberated with his counsellors:
“The Celestial Empire is upheld by an immortal descended from the skies!
Is it possible to attack it?” He thereupon wrote a letter of submission, testifying
his desire to send tribute each year, which was thenceforth allowed.</p>

<p>Lí Tai-peh afterward drowned himself from fear of the machinations of
his enemies, exclaiming, as he leaped into the water, “I’m going to catch the
moon in the midst of the sea!”</p></div>

<p>The poetry of the Chinese has been investigated by Sir John
Davis, and the republication of his first paper in an enlarged
form in 1870, with the versification of Legge’s translations of
the <cite>Shí King</cite> by his nephew, and two volumes of various pieces
by Stent, have altogether given a good variety.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Davis explains
the principles of Chinese rhythm, touches upon the tones, notices
the parallelisms, and distinguishes the various kinds of
verse, all in a scholarly manner. The whole subject, however,
still awaits more thorough treatment. Artificial poetry, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span>
the sound and jingle is regarded more than the sense, is not uncommon;
the great number of characters having the same
sound enables versifiers to do this with greater facility than is
possible in other languages, and to the serious degradation of
all high sentiment. The absence of inflections in the words
cripples the easy flow of sounds to which our ears are familiar,
but renders such lines as the following more spirited to the eye
which sees the characters than to the ear which hears them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse"><i>Liang kiang, siang niang, yang hiang tsiang,</i></div>
      <div class="verse"><i>Ki ní, pí chí, lí hí mí</i>, etc.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lines consisting of characters all containing the same radical
are also constructed in this manner, in which the sounds are
subservient to the meaning. This bizarre fashion of writing
is, however, considered fit only for pedants.</p>

<p>The Augustan age of poetry and letters was in the ninth and
tenth centuries, during the Tang dynasty, when the brightest
day of Chinese civilization was the darkest one of European.
No complete collection of poems has yet been translated into any
European language, and perhaps none would bear an entire version.
The poems of Lí Tai-peh form thirty volumes, and those
of Su Tung-po are contained in one hundred and fifteen volumes,
while the collected poems of the times of the Tang dynasty
have been published by imperial authority in nine hundred
volumes. The proportion of descriptive poetry in it is small
compared with the sentimental. The longest poem yet turned
into English is the <cite>Hwa Tsien Kí</cite>, or ‘The Flower’s Petal,’ by
P. P. Thoms, under the title of <cite>Chinese Courtship</cite>; it is in heptameter,
and his version is quite prosaic. Another of much
greater repute among native scholars, called <cite>Lí Sao</cite>, or ‘Dissipation
of Sorrows,’ dating from about B.C. 314, has been rendered
into French by D’Hervey-Saint-Denys.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE SONGS AND BALLADS.</div>

<p>It is a common pastime for literary gentlemen to try their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[705]</a></span>
skill in versification; epigrams and pasquinades are usually put
into metre, and at the examinations every candidate must hand
in his poetical exercise. Consequently, much more attention is
paid by such rhymesters to the jingle of the words and artificial
structure of the lines than to the elevation of sentiment or
copiousness of illustrations; it is as easy for them to write a
sonnet on shipping a cargo of tea as to indite a love-epistle to
their mistress. Extemporaneous verses are made on every subject,
and to illustrate occurrences that are elsewhere regarded
as too prosaic to disturb the muse.</p>

<p>Still, human emotions have been the stimulus to their expression
in verse among the Chinese as well as other people;
and all classes have found an utterance to them. Ribald and
impure ditties are sung by street-singers to their own low classes,
but such subjects do not characterize the best poets, as they
did in old Rome. A piece called ‘Chang Liang’s Flute’ is a
fair instance of the better style of songs:</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPECIMEN OF AN EXTEMPORE SONNET.</div>

<p>The following verses were presented to Dr. Parker at Canton
by a Chinese gentleman of some literary attainments, upon the
occasion of a successful operation for cataract. The original
may be considered as a very creditable example of extempore
sonnet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">A fluid, darksome and opaque, long time had dimmed my sight,</div>
      <div class="verse">For seven revolving, weary years one eye was lost to light;</div>
      <div class="verse">The other, darkened by a film, during three years saw no day,</div>
      <div class="verse">High heaven’s bright and gladd’ning light could not pierce it with its ray.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Long, long I sought the hoped relief, but still I sought in vain,</div>
      <div class="verse">My treasures lavished in the search, brought no relief from pain;</div>
      <div class="verse">Till, at length, I thought my garments I must either pawn or sell,</div>
      <div class="verse">And plenty in my house, I feared, was never more to dwell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Then loudly did I ask, for what cause such pain I bore&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse">For transgressions in a former life unatoned for before?</div>
      <div class="verse">But again came the reflection how, of yore, oft men of worth,</div>
      <div class="verse">For slight errors, had borne suff’ring great as drew my sorrow forth.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[707]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“And shall not one,” said I then, “whose worth is but as naught,</div>
      <div class="verse">Bear patiently, as heaven’s gift, what it ordains?” The thought</div>
      <div class="verse">Was scarce completely formed, when of a friend the footstep fell</div>
      <div class="verse">On my threshold, and I breathed a hope he had words of joy to tell.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“I’ve heard,” the friend who enter’d said, “there’s come to us of late</div>
      <div class="verse">A native of the ‘Flowery Flag’s’ far-off and foreign State;</div>
      <div class="verse">O’er tens of thousand miles of sea to the Inner Land he’s come&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse">His hope and aim to heal men’s pain, he leaves his native home.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">I quick went forth, this man I sought, this gen’rous doctor found;</div>
      <div class="verse">He gained my heart, he’s kind and good; for, high up from the ground,</div>
      <div class="verse">He gave a room, to which he came, at morn, at eve, at night&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse">Words were but vain were I to try his kindness to recite.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">With needle argentine he pierced the cradle of the tear.</div>
      <div class="verse">What fears I felt! Su Tung-po’s words rung threat’ning in my ear:</div>
      <div class="verse">“Glass hung in mist,” the poet says, “take heed you do not shake;”</div>
      <div class="verse">(The words of fear rung in my ear), “how if it chance to break!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">The fragile lens his needle pierced: the dread, the sting, the pain,</div>
      <div class="verse">I thought on these, and that the cup of sorrow I must drain;</div>
      <div class="verse">But then my mem’ry faithful showed the work of fell disease,</div>
      <div class="verse">How long the orbs of sight were dark, and I deprived of ease.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">And thus I thought: “If now, indeed, I were to find relief,</div>
      <div class="verse">’Twere not too much to bear the pain, to bear the present grief.”</div>
      <div class="verse">Then the words of kindness which I heard sunk deep into my soul,</div>
      <div class="verse">And free from fear I gave myself to the foreigner’s control.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">His silver needle sought the lens, and quickly from it drew</div>
      <div class="verse">The opaque and darksome fluid, whose effect so well I knew;</div>
      <div class="verse">His golden probe soon clear’d the lens, and then my eyes he bound,</div>
      <div class="verse">And laved with water sweet as is the dew to thirsty ground.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Three days thus lay I, prostrate, still; no food then could I eat;</div>
      <div class="verse">My limbs relax’d were stretched as though th’ approach of death to meet</div>
      <div class="verse">With thoughts astray&mdash;mind ill at ease&mdash;away from home and wife,</div>
      <div class="verse">I often thought that by a thread was hung my precious life.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Three days I lay, no food had I, and nothing did I feel;</div>
      <div class="verse">Nor hunger, sorrow, pain, nor hope, nor thought of woe or weal;</div>
      <div class="verse">My vigor fled, my life seemed gone, when, sudden, in my pain,</div>
      <div class="verse">There came one ray&mdash;one glimm’ring ray,&mdash;I see,&mdash;I live again!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">As starts from visions of the night he who dreams a fearful dream,</div>
      <div class="verse">As from the tomb uprushing comes one restored to day’s bright beam,</div>
      <div class="verse">Thus I, with gladness and surprise, with joy, with keen delight,</div>
      <div class="verse">See friends and kindred crowd around; I hail the blessed light.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[708]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">With grateful heart, with heaving breast, with feelings flowing o’er,</div>
      <div class="verse">I cried, “O lead me quick to him who can the sight restore!”</div>
      <div class="verse">To kneel I tried, but he forbade; and, forcing me to rise,</div>
      <div class="verse">“To mortal man bend not the knee;” then pointing to the skies:&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“I’m but,” said he, “the workman’s tool; another’s is the hand;</div>
      <div class="verse">Before <em>his</em> might, and in <em>his</em> sight, men, feeble, helpless, stand:</div>
      <div class="verse">Go, virtue learn to cultivate, and never thou forget</div>
      <div class="verse">That for some work of future good thy life is spared thee yet!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">The off’ring, token of my thanks, he refused; nor would he take</div>
      <div class="verse">Silver or gold&mdash;they seemed as dust; ’tis but for virtue’s sake</div>
      <div class="verse">His works are done. His skill divine I ever must adore,</div>
      <div class="verse">Nor lose remembrance of his name till life’s last day is o’er.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Thus have I told, in these brief words, this learned doctor’s praise:</div>
      <div class="verse">Well does his worth deserve that I should tablets to him raise.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">LAMENT OF THE POETESS SU-HWUI.</div>

<p>In this facility of versification lies one of the reasons for the
mediocrity of common Chinese poetry, but that does not prevent
its power over the popular mind being very great. Men
and women of all classes take great delight in recitation and
singing, hearing street musicians or strolling play-actors; and
these results, whatever we may judge by our standards, prove
its power and suitableness to influence them. One or two
additional specimens on different subjects may be quoted, inasmuch
as they also illustrate some of the better shades of feeling
and sentiment. A more finished piece of poetry is one
written about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 370, by Su-Hwui, whose husband was banished.
Its talented authoress is said to have written more than
five thousand lines, and among them a curious anagram of
about eight hundred characters, which was so disposed that it
would make sense equally well when read up or down, cross-wise,
backward, or forward.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Nothing from her pen remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span>
except this ode, interesting for its antiquity as well as sentiment.</p>


<h3>ODE OF SU-HWUI.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">When thou receiv’dst the king’s command to quiet the frontier,</div>
      <div class="verse">Together to the bridge we went, striving our hearts to cheer&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse">Hiding our grief. These words I gasped upon that mournful day:</div>
      <div class="verse">“Forget not, love, my fond embrace, nor tarry long away!”</div>
      <div class="verse">Ah! Is it true that since that time no message glads my sight?</div>
      <div class="verse">Think you that <em>now</em> your lone wife’s heart even in bright spring delights?</div>
      <div class="verse">Our pearly stairs and pleasant yard the foul weeds have o’ergrown;</div>
      <div class="verse">Our nuptial room&mdash;and couch&mdash;and walls&mdash;are now with dust o’erstrown.</div>
      <div class="verse">Whene’er I think of our farewell, my soul with fear grows cold;</div>
      <div class="verse">My mind resolves what shape I’d take to see thee as of old.</div>
      <div class="verse">Now as I watch the deep-sea moon, I long her form to be;</div>
      <div class="verse">Again, the mountain cloud has filled my dull heart with envy.</div>
      <div class="verse">For deep-sea moon shines year by year upon the land abroad;</div>
      <div class="verse">And ye, O mountain clouds, may meet the form of my adored!</div>
      <div class="verse">Aye, flying here and flying there, seek my beloved’s place,</div>
      <div class="verse">And at ten thousand thousand miles&mdash;speed!&mdash;gaze on his fair face.</div>
      <div class="verse">Alas! for <em>me</em> the road is long, steep mountain peaks now sever</div>
      <div class="verse">Our loving souls. I can but weep&mdash;O! may’t not be forever!</div>
      <div class="verse">The long reed’s leaves had yellow grown when we our farewell said;</div>
      <div class="verse">Who then had thought the plum-tree’s bough so oft would turn to red?</div>
      <div class="verse">The fairy flowers spreading their leaves have met the early spring&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse">Ah, genial months, what time for love!&mdash;But who can ease <em>my</em> sting?</div>
      <div class="verse">The pendant willows strew the court, for thee I pull them down;</div>
      <div class="verse">The falling flowers enrich the earth, none pick these from the ground</div>
      <div class="verse">And scatter vernal growth, as once, before the ancestral tomb!</div>
      <div class="verse">Taking the lute of Tsun I strive to chase away the gloom</div>
      <div class="verse">By thrumming, as I muse of thee, songs of departed friends.</div>
      <div class="verse">Sending my inmost thoughts away, they reach the northern ends&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse">Those northern bounds!&mdash;how far they seem, o’erpassed the hills and streams.</div>
      <div class="verse">No news, no word from those confines to lighten e’en my dreams!</div>
      <div class="verse">My dress, my pillow, once so white, are deeply stained with tears;</div>
      <div class="verse">My broidered coat with gilded flowers, all spotted now appears.</div>
      <div class="verse">The very geese and storks to me, when in their passage north,</div>
      <div class="verse">Seemed by their cries, my distant love, to tear my heartstrings forth.</div>
      <div class="verse">No more my lute&mdash;though thou wert strong, with passion was I wrung;</div>
      <div class="verse">My grief was its utmost bent&mdash;my song was still unsung.</div>
      <div class="verse">Ah! husband, lord, thy love I feel is stable as the hills;</div>
      <div class="verse">’Tis joy to think each hour of this&mdash;a balm for countless ills!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">I had but woven half my task&mdash;I gave it to his Grace:</div>
      <div class="verse">O grant my husband quick release, I pine for his embrace!</div>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE DRAMAS AND BURLETTAS.</div>

<p>In the department of plays and dramas, Chinese literature
shows a long list of names, few or none of which have ever
been heard of away from their native soil. Some of their
pieces have been translated by Julien, Bazin, Davis, and
others, most of which were selected from the <cite>Hundred
Plays of Yuen</cite>. The origin of the present Chinese drama
does not date back, according to M. Bazin, beyond the Tang
dynasty, though many performances designed to be played and
sung in pantomime had been written before that epoch. He
cites the names of eighty-one persons, besides mentioning other
plays of unknown authors, whose combined writings amount to
five hundred and sixty-four separate plays; all of whom flourished
during the Mongol dynasty. The plays that have been
translated from this collection give a tolerably good idea of
Chinese talent in this difficult department; and, generally speaking,
whatever strictures may be made upon the management of
the plot, exhibition of character, unity of action, or illustration
of manners, the tendency of the play is on the side of justice
and morality. Père Prémare first translated a play in 1731,
under the title of the <cite>Orphan of Chau</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> which was taken by
Voltaire as the groundwork of one of his plays. <cite>The Heir in
Old Age</cite> and the <cite>Sorrows of Han</cite> are the names of two translated
by Sir J. F. Davis. The <cite>Circle of Chalk</cite> was translated
and published in 1832 by Julien, and a volume of Bazin, ainé,
containing the <cite>Intrigues of an Abigail</cite>, the <cite>Compared Tunic</cite>, the
<cite>Songstress</cite>, and <cite>Resentment of Tau Ngo</cite>, appeared in 1838, at
Paris. None of these pieces exhibit much intricacy of plot,
nor would the simple arrangements of Chinese theatres allow
much increase to the <i>dramatis personæ</i> without confusion. M.
Bazin, moreover, translated the <cite>Pí-pa Kí</cite>, or <cite>History of a Lute</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span>
a drama in twenty-four acts, of more pretensions, partaking of
the novel as well as the drama; the play is said to have been
represented at Peking in 1404, under the Ming dynasty.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MENDER OF CHINAWARE&mdash;A FARCE.</div>

<p>Besides plays in the higher walks of the drama, which form
the principal part of the performances at theatres, there are
by-plays or farces, which, being confined to two or three interlocutors,
depend for their attractiveness upon the droll gesticulations,
impromptu allusions to passing occurrences, and excellent
pantomimic action of the performers. They are usually brought
on at the conclusion of the bill, and from the freedom given in
them to an exhibition of the humor or wit of the players, are
much liked by the people. A single illustration will exhibit
the simple range and character of these burlettas.</p>

knowledge, to their Great Wall, which can neither protect
from its enemies, nor be of any real use to its makers. Its
deficiencies are glaring. No treatises on the geography of foreign
countries nor truthful narratives of travels abroad are
contained in it, nor any account of the languages of their inhabitants,
their history, or their governments. Philological
works in other languages than those spoken within the Empire
are unknown, and must, owing to the nature of the language,
remain so until foreigners prepare them. Works on natural
history, medicine, and physiology are few and useless, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[719]</a></span>
those on mathematics and the exact sciences are much less
popular and useful than they might be; and in the great range
of theology, founded on the true basis of the Bible, there is
almost nothing. The character of the people has been mostly
formed by their ancient books, and this correlate influence has
tended to repress independent investigation in the pursuit of
truth, though not to destroy it. A new infusion of science,
religion, and descriptive geography and history will lead to
comparison with other countries, and bring out whatever in it
is good.</p>

<p>A survey of this body of literature shows the effect of governmental
patronage, in maintaining its character for what
appears to us to be a wearisome uniformity. New ideas, facts,
and motives must now come from the outer world, which will
gradually elevate the minds of the people above the same unvarying
channel. If the scholar knows that the goal he strives
for is to be attained by proficiency in the single channel of
classical knowledge, he cannot be expected to attend to other
studies until he has secured the prize. A knowledge of medicine,
mathematics, geography, or foreign languages, might, indeed,
do the candidate much more good than all he gets out
of the classics, but knowledge is not his object; and where
all run the same race, all must study the same works. But
let there be a different programme of themes and essays,
and a wider range of subjects required of the students, and
the present system of governmental examinations in China,
with all its imperfections, can be made of great benefit to
the people, if it is not put to a strain too great for the end in
view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE PROVERBS.</div>

<p>The Chinese are fond of proverbs and aphorisms. They
employ them in their writings and conversation as much as any
people, and adorn their houses by copying them upon elegant
scrolls, carving them upon pillars, and embroidering them upon
banners. A complete collection of the proverbs of the Chinese
has never been made, even among the people themselves any
more than among those of other lands. Davis published, in
1828, a volume called <cite>Moral Maxims</cite>, containing two hundred
aphorisms; P. Perny issued an assortment of four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[720]</a></span>
and forty-one in 1869; and J. Doolittle collected several hundred
proverbs, signs, couplets, and scrolls in his <cite>Vocabulary</cite>.
Besides these, a collection of two thousand seven hundred and
twenty proverbs was published in 1875 by W. Scarborough,
furnished with a good index, and, like the others noted here,
with the original text. Davis mentions the <cite>Ming Sin Pao
Kien</cite>, or ‘Jewelled Mirror for Illumining the Mind,’ as containing
a large number of proverbs. The <cite>Ku Sz’ Kiung Lin</cite>,
or ‘Coral Forest of Ancient Matters,’ is a similar collection;
but if that be compared to a dictionary of quotations, this is
better likened to a classical dictionary, the notes which follow
the sentences leaving the reader in no doubt as to their
meaning.</p>

<p>Manuscript lists of sentences suitable for hanging upon
doors or in parlors are collected by persons who write them
at New Year’s, and whose success depends upon their facility
in quoting elegant couplets. The following selection will
exhibit to some extent this branch of Chinese wisdom and
wit:</p>

<span class="smaller">ARCHITECTURE, DRESS, AND DIET OF THE CHINESE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It is a sensible remark of De Guignes,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> that “the habit we
fall into of conceiving things according to the words which express
them, often leads us into error when reading the relations
of travellers. Such writers have seen objects altogether new,
but they are compelled, when describing them, to employ equivalent
terms in their own language in order to be understood;
while these same terms tend to deceive the reader, who imagines
that he sees such palaces, colonnades, peristyles, etc., under
these designations as he has been used to, when, in fact, they
are quite another thing.” The same observation is true of other
things than architecture, and of other nations than the Chinese,
and this confusion of terms and meanings proves a fruitful
source of error in regard to an accurate knowledge of foreign
nations, and a just perception of their condition. For instance,
the terms <i>a court of justice</i>, <i>a common school</i>, <i>politeness</i>, <i>learning</i>,
<i>navy</i>, <i>houses</i>, etc., as well as the names of things, like <i>razor</i>,
<i>shoe</i>, <i>cap</i>, <i>bed</i>, <i>pencil</i>, <i>paper</i>, etc., are inapplicable to the same
things in England and China; while it is plainly impossible to
coin a new word in English to describe the Chinese article, and
equally inexpedient to introduce the native term. If, for example,
the utensil used by the Chinese to shave with were
picked up in Portsmouth by some English navvy who had never
seen or heard of it, he would be more likely to call it an oyster-knife,
or a wedge, than a razor; while the use to which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span>
applied must of course give it that name, and would, if it were
still more unlike the western article. So with other things.
The ideas a Chinese gives to the terms <i>hwangtí</i>, <i>kwanfu</i>, <i>pao</i>,
<i>pih</i>, and <i>shu</i>, are very different from those conveyed to an
American by the words <i>emperor</i>, <i>magistrate</i>, <i>cannon</i>, <i>pencil</i>,
and <i>book</i>. Since a person can only judge of what he hears or
reads by what he knows, it is desirable that when he meets with
western names applied to their equivalents in eastern countries,
the function of a different civilization, habits, and notions should
not be overlooked in the opinion he forms. These remarks are
peculiarly applicable to the domestic life of the Chinese, to their
houses, diet, dress, and social customs; although careful descriptions
may go a good way in conveying just ideas, it cannot be
hoped that they will do what the most cursory examination of
the object or trait would instantly accomplish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPULAR ERRORS REGARDING FOREIGN COUNTRIES.</div>

<p>The notions entertained abroad on these particulars are, it need
hardly be remarked, rather more accurate than those the Chinese
have of distant countries, and it is scarcely possible that
they can lose their conceit in their own civilization and position
among the nations so long as such ideas are entertained as the
following extract exhibits. Tien Kí-shih, a popular essayist of
the last century, thus congratulates himself and his readers: “I
felicitate myself that I was born in China, and constantly think
how very different it would have been with me if I had been
born beyond the seas in some remote part of the earth, where
the people, far removed from the converting maxims of the
ancient kings, and ignorant of the domestic relations, are clothed
with the leaves of plants, eat wood, dwell in the wilderness, and
live in the holes of the earth; though born in the world, in
such a condition I should not have been different from the
beasts of the field. But now, happily, I have been born in the
Middle Kingdom. I have a house to live in; have food and
drink, and elegant furniture; have clothing and caps, and infinite
blessings: truly, the highest felicity is mine.” This extract
well indicates the isolation of the writer and his race from their
fellow-men; among the neighboring nations even the Japanese
would have shown him his erroneous view. The seclusion which
had been forced upon both these peoples, who closed their doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span>
as the surest possible defence against aggression from foreign
traders and sought in this fashion to remove all cause of quarrel,
brought with it in time the almost equal dangers of ignorance
and inability to understand their true position among the
nations of the world.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Diagram of Chinese Roof Construction. (From Fergusson.)</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">ABSENCE OF GREAT ARCHITECTURAL MONUMENTS.</div>

<p>The architecture of the Chinese suggests, in its general outline
and the peculiar concave roof, a canvas tent as its primary
<i>motive</i>, though there is no further proof than this likeness of
its origin. From the palace to the hovel, in temples and in private
dwellings, this type everywhere stands confessed,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> and almost
nothing like a dome or cupola, a spire or a turret, is anywhere
found. Few instances occur of an attempt to develop even this
simple model into a grand or imposing building. While the
Mogul princes in India reared costly mausolea and palaces to
perpetuate their memory and the splendor of their reigns, the
monarchs of China, with equal or greater resources at command,
seldom indulged in this princely pastime, or even attempted
the erection of any enduring monument to commemorate their
taste or their splendor. Whether it was owing to the absence
of the beautiful and majestic models seen in western countries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[727]</a></span>
or to ignorance of the mechanical principles of the art, the fact
is not the less observable, and the inference as to the advance
made by them in knowledge and taste not less just.</p>

<p>Fergusson has no doubt assigned one good reason for this
fact, in that “the Chinese never had either a dominant priesthood
or a hereditary nobility. The absence of the former class
is important, because it is to sacred art that architecture has
owed its highest inspiration, and sacred art is never so strongly
developed as under the influence of a powerful and splendid
hierarchy. In the same manner the want of a hereditary nobility
is equally unfavorable to domestic architecture of a durable description.
Private feuds and private wars were till lately unknown,
and hence there are no fortalices or fortified mansions,
which by their mass and solidity give such a marked character
to a certain class of domestic edifices in the west.”<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> These
reasons have their weight, but they hardly cover the whole
question, whose solution reaches into the well-known inertness
of the imaginative faculty in the Chinese mind. It is nevertheless
true that there is nothing in the whole Empire worthy to
be called an architectural ruin, nothing which can inform us
whether previous generations constructed edifices more splendid
or more mean than the present.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSTRUCTION OF CHINESE BUILDINGS.</div>

<p>Dwelling-houses are generally of one story, having neither
cellars nor basements, and lighted by lattices opening into a
court; they must not equal adjacent temples in height, nor
possess the ornaments appropriated to palaces and religious establishments.
The common building materials are bricks, adobie
or matting for the walls, stone for the foundation, brick
tiling for the roof, and wood only for the inner work; stone and
wooden houses are not unknown, but are so rare as to attract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[728]</a></span>
attention. The high prices of timber and the very partial use
of window-glass have both tended to modify and restrict the
construction of dwellings. The <i>ní chuen</i>, or sifted earth, is a
compound of decomposed granite or gravel and lime mixed with
water, and sometimes a little oil, of which durable walls are
made by pounding it into a solid mass between planks secured
at the sides and elevated as the wall rises, or by beating it into
large blocks; when stuccoed and protected from the rain this
material gradually hardens into stone. In houses of the better
sort the stone work of the foundation rises three or four feet
above the ground, and sometimes the finished surfaces, great
size of the stones and the regularity of their arrangement make
one regret that the same skill had not been expended on large
edifices. In towns their fronts present no opening except the
door, and when the outer walls of several houses join those of
gardens and enclosures, the street presents an uninteresting
sameness, unrelieved by steps, windows, balconies, porticoes,
or front yards. The walls are twenty-five or thirty feet high,
usually hollow, or too thin to safely support the roof unaided.
In the common buildings a framework of wood is erected on
the foundation, which has large stones so arranged as to receive
the posts, and on these rests the entire weight of the roof. The
brick nogging fills up the intervals, but supports nothing; it is
sometimes solid, more frequently merely a face-work, and if the
roof becomes leaky or broken a heavy rain will destroy the
wall, as it soaks through the courses and washes out the mud
within. In the central provinces common walls are often made
of small bricks four inches square and one thick, which are laid
on their edges in a series of hollows; between the courses a
plank sometimes adds greater strength to the wall. These cellular
constructions are more durable than would be imagined provided
the stucco remains uninjured.</p>

<p>The bricks are the same size as our own, and usually burned
to a grayish slate color; they are made by hand, and sell at a
price varying from three dollars to eight dollars a thousand.
In the sea-coast districts lime is cheaply obtained from shells,
but in the interior from limestone calcined by anthracite coal;
the people use it pure, only occasionally mixing sand with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[729]</a></span>
it for either mortar or stucco. The walls are often stuccoed,
and when not thus covered the bricks are occasionally rubbed
smooth and pointed with fine cement. In place of a broad
cornice the top is frequently relieved by a pretty ornament
of moulded work of painted clay figures in <i>alto relievo</i>, representing
a battle scene, a landscape, clusters of flowers, or some
other design, defended from the weather by the projecting
eaves. A black painted band, relieved by corners and designs
of flowers and scrolls, is a cheap substitute for the carved
figures.</p>

<p>The roofs are hipped in some provinces, but rarely in the
north. They are steep, and if kept tight will last several years;
the grass which is apt to spring up on them is a source of injury,
and its growth or removal alike endangers the soundness
of the construction. The yellow and green glazed tiles of public
buildings add to their beauty, as do the dragon’s heads and
globes on their ridge-poles; these features, together with the
earthen dogs at the corners of temples or official houses, make
the structures exceedingly picturesque. In Peking the framework
under the wide eaves of palaces is tastefully painted in
green and gold, and protected by a netting of copper wire.
Roofs are made of earthen tiles laid on coarse clapboarding
that rests on the purlines in alternate ridges and furrows. The
under layer consists of square thin pieces, laid side by side in
ascending rows with the lower edges overlapping; the sides are
covered by the semi-cylindrical tiles, which are further protected
by a covering of mortar. In the northern provinces the tiles
are laid in a course of mud resting on straw over the clapboarding.
The workmen begin the tiling at the ridge-pole and
finish as they come down to the eaves, so as not to walk over
the tiles and crack them; but such roofs easily leak in driving
storms. No chimneys are seen; the slope is steep, for quick
discharge of rain and snow. Terraces are erected on shops, but
balustrades or flat roofs are seldom seen. Occasionally the
gable walls rise above the roof in degrees, imparting a singular,
bow-like aspect to the edifice. The purlines and ridge-pole extend
from wall to wall, and the rafters are slender strips. In
all roofs the principal weight rests on the two rows of pillars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[730]</a></span>
at the sides, that uphold the plates, and the antefixæ which
support the broad eaves far beyond the wall. A series of
beams and posts above the plates and tie-beams make the roof
very heavy but also secure; curb and mansard roofs are unknown.</p>

<p>The pillars of stone or timber in Chinese temples are often
noticeable, owing to their size or length as single pieces. They
are, however, unadorned with either capital or carved base,
though the shaft may be finely carved and painted, the color
decoration being often upon a thick coating of <i>papier-maché</i>,
laid on to protect the wood. In two-story houses the sleepers
of the floor are supported on tie-beams attached to the main
posts if they do not rest on the wall. Posts form an element
of all Chinese buildings, either to support the roof or the
veranda. The entrance is on the sides, and the wall is set back
from the outer line of the eaves so as to afford a shelter or porch.
Hipped roofs enable the architect to encompass the entire
building with a veranda, this being a common arrangement in
the southern provinces. A slight ceiling usually conceals the
tiling, but the apartment appears lofty owing to the cavity of
the roof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORNAMENTAL EDIFICES AND DWELLINGS.</div>

<p>The pavilion is a prominent feature of Chinese architecture,
and its ornamentation calls out the best talent of the builder in
making his edifice acceptable. One charming specimen of this
style at the Emperor’s summer palace of Yuen-ming Yuen is
already famous, its material being of pure copper; it is about
fourteen feet square and twenty high.</p>

<p>Another beautiful structure which well exhibits the pavilion
is shown in the adjoining cut. It is the <i>Pih-yung Kung</i>, or
‘Classic Hall,’ built by Kienlung adjacent to the Confucian
Temple at Peking (page <a href="#Page_74">74</a>), and devoted to expounding the
classics. This lofty building, which may be here seen through
an ornamental arch across the court, is perfectly square, covered
with a four-sided double roof, whose bright yellow tiles and
gilded ball at the apex produce a most brilliant effect in the
sunlight. The deep veranda, completely encircling the structure
and supported by a score of colored wooden pillars, very
ably relieves the dead mass and heavy upper roof of the pavilion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[731]</a></span>
proper. Around flow the waters of a circular tank, edged with
marble balustrades and spanned by four bridges which form
the approaches to each of the sides.</p>

<p>The general disposition of a Chinese dwelling of the better
sort is that of a series of rooms separated and lighted by intervening
courts, and accessible along a covered corridor communicating
with each, or by side passages leading through the courts.
In cities, where the houses are cramped and the lots irregular
in shape, there is more diversity in the arrangement and size
of rooms; and in the country establishments of wealthy families,
where the gradual increase of the members calls for additional
space, the succession of courts and buildings, interspersed
with gardens and pools, sometimes renders the whole not a little
complicated. The great expense of timber for floors, posts, and
sleepers has been the chief reason for retaining the single
story, rather than the awkwardness caused by cramping women’s
feet. No contrivance for warming the rooms by means of
chimneys or flues exists, except that found in the <i>kang</i>, or brick
bed, on which the inmates lie and sit.</p>

<p>The entrance into large mansions in the country is by a triple
gate leading through a lawn or garden up to the hall; in towns,
a single door, usually elevated a step or two above the street,
introduces the visitor into a porch or court. A wall or movable
screen is placed inside of the doorway, and the intervening
space is occupied by the porter; upon the wall on the left is
often seen a shrine dedicated to the gods of the threshold. In
the houses of officials, upon this wall is inscribed a list of dignities
and offices which the master has held during his life. The
door is solidly constructed, and moves upon pivots turning in
sockets. Under the projecting eaves hang paper lanterns informing
the passer-by of the name and title of the householder,
and when lighted at night serving to illumine the street and
designate his habitation; for door-plates and numbers are unknown.
The roughness of the gate is somewhat concealed by
the names or grotesque representations of two tutelar gods,
Shintu and Yuhlui, to whom the guardianship of the house is
entrusted; while the sides and lintel are embellished with felicitous
quotations written upon red paper, or with sign-boards of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[732]</a></span>
official rank. The doorkeeper and other servants lodge in small
rooms within the gateway, and above the porch is an attic containing
one or two apartments, to be reached by a rude stairway.</p>

<p>On passing behind the screen a court, occasionally adorned
with flowers or a fancy fish-pool, is crossed before reaching the
principal hall. The upper end of the hall is furnished with a
high table, on which incense vases, idolatrous utensils, and offerings
are placed in honor of the divinities and lares worshipped
there, whose tablets and names are on the wall. Sometimes the
table merely contains flowers in jars, fancy pieces of white
quartz, limestone or jade, or ornaments of various kinds. Before
the table is a large couch, with a low stand in its centre,
and a pillow for reclining upon. In front of it the chairs are
arranged down the room in two rows facing each other, each
pair having a small table between them. The floors are made of
thick, large tiles of brick or marble, or of hard cement. Even
in a bright day the room is dim, and the absence of carpets and
fireplaces, and of windows to afford a prospect abroad, renders
it cheerless to a foreigner accustomed to his own glazed and
loftier houses.</p>

<p>A rear door near the side wall opens either into a kitchen or
court, across which are the female apartments, or directly into
the latter and the rooms for domestics. Instead of being always
rectangular the doors are sometimes made round, leaf-shaped,
or semi-circular, and it is thought desirable that they should not
open opposite each other, lest evil spirits find their way in from
the street. The rear rooms are lighted by skylights when
other modes are unavailable, and along the southern sea-coasts
the thin laminæ of a species of oyster (<i>Placuna</i>) cut into small
squares supply the place of window-glass. Commerce is gradually
bringing this material into greater use all over the land,
though the fear of thieves still limits it. Corean paper is the
chief substitute for glass in the north. The kitchen is a small
affair, for the universal use of portable furnaces enables the
inmates to cook wherever the smoke will be least troublesome.
Warming the house, even as far north as Ningpo, is not frequent,
as the inmates rely on their quilted and fur garments for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[733]</a></span>
protection. The flue of the tiled-brick divan, or <i>kang</i>, is connected
with a pit lined with brick dug in the floor in front;
when the pot of coal is well lighted and placed near the opening,
the draft carries the heat into the passages running under
the surface, and soon warms the room without much smoke.
The pot of burning coal furnishes all the cooking-fire the poor
have, and at night the inmates sleep on the warm bricks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRANGEMENT OF COUNTRY HOUSES.</div>

<p>The country establishments of wealthy men furnish the best
expression of Chinese ideas of elegance and comfort. In these
enclosures the hall of ancestors, library, school-room, and summer-houses
are detached and erected upon low plinths, surrounded
by a veranda, and frequently decorated with tracery
and ornamental carving. Near the rear court are the female
apartments and offices, many of the former and the sleeping
apartments being in attics. Considerable space is occupied by
the quadrangles, which are paved and embellished by fish-pools,
flowering shrubs, and other plants. Mr. Fortune describes<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> the
house and garden of a gentleman at Ningpo as being connected
by rude-looking caverns of rock-work, “and what at first sight
appears to be a subterranean passage leading from room to room,
through which the visitor passes to the garden. The small
courts, of which a glimpse is caught in passing along, are fitted
up with rock-work; dwarf trees are planted here and there in
various places, and graceful creepers hang down into the pools
in front. These being passed, another cavernous passage leads
into the garden, with its dwarf trees, vases, ornamented lattices,
and beautiful shrubs suddenly opening to the view. By
windings and glimpses along the rocky passages into other
courts, and hiding the real boundary by masses of shrubs and
trees, the grounds are made to appear much larger than they
really are.”</p>

<p>The houses of the poor are dark, dirty, low, and narrow tenements,
where the floor is of earth covered with mats or tiled,
and the doorway the only opening, on which a swinging mat
conceals the interior. The whole family often sleep, eat, and
live in a single room. Pigs, dogs, and hens dispute the space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[734]</a></span>
with children and furniture&mdash;if a table and a few trestles and
stools, pots and plates, deserve that name. The filthy street
without is a counterpart to the gloomy, smoky abode within,
and a single walk through the streets and lanes of such a neighborhood
is sufficient to reconcile a person to any ordinary condition
of life. On the outskirts of the town a still poorer class
take up with huts made of mats and thatch upon the ground,
through which the rain and wind find free course. It is surprising
that people can live and enjoy health, and even be
cheerful, as the Chinese are, in such circumstances. Between
these hovels and the abodes of the rich is a class of middle
houses, consisting of three or four small rooms surrounding a
court, each one lodging a family, which uses its portion of the
quadrangle.</p>

<p>The best furniture is made of a heavy wood stained to resemble
ebony; camphor, elm, pine, aspen, and melia woods furnish
cheaper material. Ornamental articles, porcelain vases, copper
tripods or pots, stone screens, book-shelves, flowers in pots, etc.,
show the national taste. Ink sketches of landscapes, gay scrolls
inscribed with sentences suspended from the walls, and pretty
lanterns relieve the baldness of the room; their combined effect
is not destitute of variety and elegance, though there is a lack of
<em>comfort</em>. Partitions are sometimes fancifully made of lattice-work,
with openings neatly arranged for the reception of boxes
containing books. The bedrooms are small, poorly ventilated,
and seldom visited except at night. A massive bedstead of
costly woods, elaborately carved, and supporting a tester for
the silk curtains and mosquito-bars, is often shown as the family
pride and heirloom; a scroll of fine writing adorns its fringe or
valance. Mattresses or feather beds are not used, and the pillow
is a hollow square frame of rattan or bamboo. The bed, wardrobe,
and toilet usually complete the furniture of the sleeping
apartments of the Chinese; but if this is also the sitting room,
the bed is rolled up so as often to furnish seats on its boards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STYLE OF GARDENS.</div>

<p>The grounds of the rich are laid out in good style, and were
not the tasteful arrangements and diversified shrubbery which
would render them charming resorts almost always spoiled by
general bad keeping&mdash;neglect and ruin, if not nastiness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[735]</a></span>
offals, being often visible&mdash;they would please the most fastidious.
The necessity of having a place for the women and children
to recreate themselves is one reason for having an open
enclosure, even if it be only a plat of flowers or a bed of
vegetables. In the imperial gardens the attempt to make an
epitome of nature has been highly successful. De Guignes
describes their art of gardening as “imitating the beauties and
producing the inequalities of nature. Instead of alleys planted
symmetrically or uniform grounds, there are winding footpaths,
trees here and there as if by chance, woody or sterile hillocks,
and deep gulleys with narrow passages, whose sides are steep
or rough with rocks, and presenting only a few miserable
shrubs. They like to bring together in gardening, in the same
view, cultivated grounds and arid plains; to make the field
uneven and cover it with artificial rock-work; to dig caverns in
mountains, on whose tops are arbors half overthrown, and around
which tortuous footpaths run and return into themselves, prolonging,
as it were, the extent of the grounds and increasing the
pleasure of the walk.”</p>

<p>A fish-pond, supplied by a rivulet running wildly through
the grounds, forms a pretty feature of such gardens, in which,
if there be room, a summer-house is erected on a rocky islet, or
on piles over the water, accessible by a rugged causey of rock-work.
The nelumbium lily, with its plate-like leaves and magnificent
flowers, is a general favorite in such places; carp and
other fish are reared in their waters, and gold-fish in small
tanks. Whenever it is possible a gallery runs along the sides
of the pond for the pleasure and use of the females in the household.
A tasteful device in some gardens, which beguiles the
visitor’s ramble, is a rude kind of shell or pebble mosaic inlaid
in the gravelly paths, representing birds, animals, or other
figures; the time required to decipher them prolongs the walk,
and apparently increases the size of the grounds. The pieces of
rock-work are cemented and bound with wire; and in fish-pools,
grottos, or causeways this unique ornament has a charming
effect, the moss and plants which grow upon it adding rather to
its appropriateness.</p>

<p>The wood and mason work is unsubstantial, requiring con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[736]</a></span>stant
repairs; when new they present a pretty appearance, but
both gardens and houses, when neglected, soon fall into a ruinous
condition. Some of the principal merchants at Canton, in
the former days of the hong monopoly, had cultivated grounds
of greater or less extent attached to their establishments. One
of them, by way of variety, constructed a summer-house entirely
of glass, this wonderful structure being made so that it
could be closed and protected with shutters.</p>

<p>The arrangement of shops and warehouses is modified by the
uses to which they are applied, but they still resemble dwelling-houses
more than is the case with stores in western cities. The
rear room of the shop is a small apartment, used for a dormitory,
store-room, or workshop, and sometimes for all these purposes
together; it is in most cases on an upper floor. Small
ones are lighted from the street, but the largest by a skylight,
in which cases there is a latticed screen reaching across the
room, to secure the inside from the street. The whole shop-front
is thrown open by day and closed at night by shutters
running in grooves, and secured by heavy cross-bars to a row of
posts which fit in sockets in the threshold and lintel. The doorway
recedes a foot or two, and the projecting roof serves to protect
customers, and such goods as are exposed, from the rain and
sun. In small shops there are two counters, a long one running
back from the door, and another at right angles to it, reaching
partly across the front. The shopman sits within the angle
formed by these, and as they are low he can easily serve a customer
in the street as well as in the shop. At night the smaller
one often forms a lodging place for homeless beggars. The
facing of the outer counter is of granite, and in Canton a niche
containing a tablet inscribed to the god of wealth is cut in the
end, where incense is burned. Another shrine is placed on
high within the apartment, dedicated to the deity of the place,
whoever he may be.</p>

<p>The loft is much contracted; and that it may not intercept
the skylight, it is usually a small chamber reached by a gallery,
and lighted in front. Chinese tradesmen do not make much
display in exhibiting their goods, and the partial use of glass
renders it somewhat unsafe for them to do so. The want of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[737]</a></span>
yard compels them to cook and wash either behind or on top of
the building; clerks and workmen usually eat and sleep under
the shop roof. In the densest parts of Canton the roofs are
covered with a loose framework, on which firewood is piled,
clothes washed and dried, and meals cooked; it also affords a
sleeping place in summer. In case of fire, however, these lumbered
roofs become like so many tinder-boxes, and aid not a
little to spread the flames.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHOP AND THOROUGHFARES.</div>

<p>The narrowness of the streets in Chinese cities is a source of
many inconveniences; few exceed ten or twelve feet in width,
and most of those in Canton are less than eight. No large
squares having fountains and shrubbery, nor any open spaces
except the areas in front of temples relieve the closeness of
these lanes. The absence of horses and carriages in southern
cities, and a custom of huddling together, a desire to screen the
thoroughfare from the sun, and ignorance of the advantages
of another mode, are among the leading reasons for making
them so contracted; while the difficulty of collecting a mob in
them should be mentioned as one point in their favor. In case
of fire it is difficult to get access to the burning buildings, and
dangerous for the inmates to move or save their property. At
all times porters carrying burdens are impeded by the crowd
of passengers, who likewise must pass Indian file lest they tilt
against the porters. Ventilation is imperfect where the
buildings are packed so closely, and the public necessaries and
their offal carried through the streets by the scavengers pollute
the air. Drainage is very superficial and incomplete; the sewers
easily choke up or get broken and exude their contents over
the pathway. The ammoniacal and other gases which are generated
aggravate the ophthalmic diseases so prevalent; and
it is a matter of surprise that the cholera, plague, or yellow
fever does not visit the inhabitants of such confined abodes,
who breathe so tainted an atmosphere. The peculiar government
of cities by means of wards and neighborhoods, each
responsible to the officials, combined with the ignorance
among all ranks of the principles of hygiene, will account for
the evils so patent to one accustomed to the energetic sway of
a mayor and board of health in most European cities, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span>
can bring knowledge and power to coöperate for the well-being
of all.</p>

<p>The streets are usually paved with slabs of stone laid cross-wise,
and except near markets and wells are comparatively
clean. They are not laid out straight, and some present a singularly
irregular appearance from the slight angle which each
house makes with its neighbors; it being considered rather unlucky
to have them exactly even. The names of the streets are
written on the gateways crossing them, whenever they are
marked at all; occasionally, as at Canton, each division makes
a separate neighborhood and has its own name; a single long
street will thus have five, six, or more names. The general arrangement
of a Chinese city presents a labyrinth of streets,
alleys, and byways very perplexing to a stranger who has
neither plan nor directory to guide him, nor numbers upon
the houses and shops to direct him. The sign-boards are
hung each side of the door, or securely inserted in stone sockets;
some of them are ten or fifteen feet high, and being gaily
painted and gilded on both sides with picturesque characters, a
succession of them as seen down a street produces a gay effect.
The inscriptions simply mention the kind of goods sold, and
without half the puffing seen in western cities; accounts sometimes
given of the inscriptions on sign-boards in Chinese cities,
as “No cheating here,” and others, describe the exception and
not the rule. The edicts of government, handbills of medicines
and the famous doctors who make them, notices offering rewards
for children who are lost or slaves escaped, new shops opened,
houses to let, or other events, cover blank walls in great variety,
printed on red, black, white, or yellow paper; the absence of
newspapers leads shopmen to depend more for patronage upon
a circle of customers and the distribution of cards than to spend
much money in handbills. The shrines of the street gods occur
in southern cities, located in niches in the wall, with altars
before them.</p>

<p>The temples and assembly-halls are the only public buildings
in Chinese cities belonging to the people. Their courts and
cloisters, with such gardens, tea-houses, and pools as may be
accessible, attract constant crowds, and furnish the only places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[739]</a></span>
of common resort. The priests derive no small portion of their
income from travellers, and their establishments are consequently
made more commodious and extensive than the number
of priests or the throng of worshippers require.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLUB-HOUSES AND TAVERNS.</div>

<p>The assembly-halls or club-houses form a peculiar feature of
Chinese society. There are more than a hundred in Canton
and many hundreds in Peking. They are built sometimes by a
particular craft as its guildhall, or more commonly erected by
persons resorting to the place for trade, study, or amusement,
who subscribe to fit up a commodious establishment to accommodate
persons coming from the same town. In this way their
convenience, assistance, oversight, and general safety are all increased.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
All buildings pay a ground rent to the government,
but no data are available for comparing this tax with that levied
in western cities. The government furnishes the owner of the
ground with a <i>hung kí</i>, or ‘red deed,’ in testimony of his right
to occupancy, which puts him in possession as long as he pays
the taxes. There is a record office in the local magistracy of
such documents.</p>

<p>Houses are rented on short leases, and the rent collected
quarterly in advance; the annual income from real estate is
between nine and twelve per cent. The yearly rent of the best
shops in Canton is from $150 to $400; there is no system of
insuring against fire, which, with the municipal taxes and the
difficulty of collecting bad rents, enhances their price. Such
kind of property in China is liable to many risks.</p>

<p>The taverns are numerous and adapted for every calling.
Though they will not bear comparison with western hotels, they
are far in advance of the cheerless khans and caravansaries
found in Western Asia. The traveller brings his own bedding,
sometimes also his own provision, and when night comes spreads
his mat upon the floor or divan and lies down in his clothes.
The better sort of travellers order a room for themselves, but
officials or rich men go to temples, or hire a boat in which to
travel and sleep; this usage takes off the best class of customers.
One considerable source of income to innkeepers is the prepa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[740]</a></span>ration
of dinners for parties of men, who either come to the
house or send to it for so many covers; for when a gentleman
invites his friends to an entertainment it is common to serve it
up at his warehouse, or at an inn. In towns and cities thousands
of men eat in the streets; the number of eating and cooking-stalls
produces a most lively impression upon a stranger.
This custom has had a good effect in promoting the general
courtesy so conspicuous among the people, and is increased by
great numbers of street story-tellers. The noisy hilarity of
the customers, as they ply their “nimble lads,” or chopsticks,
and the vociferous cries of the cooks recommending their cakes
and dishes, with the steaming savor from the frying-pan and
kettles, form only one of the many objects to attract the notice
of the foreign observer. Their appearance and the variety of
bustling scenes and picturesque novelties presented to him afford
constant instruction and entertainment. Those at Canton
have been thus described by an eye-witness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STREET SCENES IN CANTON AND PEKING.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The number of itinerant workmen of one kind or another which line the
sides of the streets or occupy the areas before public buildings in Chinese
towns is a remarkable feature. Fruiterers, pastrymen, cooks, venders of
gimcracks, and wayside shopmen are found in other countries as well as China;
but to see a travelling blacksmith or tinker, an itinerant glass-mender, a peripatetic
repairer of umbrellas, a locomotive seal-cutter, an ambulatory barber,
a migratory banker, a peregrinatory apothecary or druggist, or a walking shoe-maker
and cobbler, one must travel hitherward. These movable establishments,
together with fortune-tellers, herb and booksellers, chiromancers, etc.,
pretty well fill up the space, so that one often sees both sides of the streets
literally lined with the stalls, wares, or tools of persons selling or making
something to eat or to wear. The money-changer sits behind a small table, on
which his strings of cash are chained, and where he weighs the silver he is to
change; his neighbor, the seal-cutter, sits next him near a like fashioned table.
The barber has his chest of drawers made to serve for a seat, and if he has not
a furnace of his own he heats his water at the cook’s or the blacksmith’s fire
near by, perhaps shaving his friend gratis by way of recompense.</p>

<p>The herbseller chooses an open place where he will not be trampled on,
and there displays his simples and his plasters, while the dentist, with a ghastly
string of fangs and grinders around his neck, testimonials of his skill, sits over
against him, each with his infallible remedy. The book-peddler and chooser
of lucky days, and he who searches for stolen goods by divination, arrange
themselves on either side, with their tables and stalls, and array of sticks,
pencils, signs, and pictures, all trying to “catch a little pigeon.” The spectacle-mender
and razor-grinder, the cutler and seller of bangles and bracelets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[741]</a></span>
and the maker of clay puppets or mender of old shoes, are not far off, all plying
their callings as busily as if they were in their own shops. Then, besides
the hundreds of stalls for selling articles of food, dress, or ornament, there are
innumerable hucksters going up and down with baskets and trays slung on
their shoulders, each bawling or making his own peculiar note, which, with
coolies transporting burdens, chair-bearers carrying sedans, and passengers following
one another like a stream, with here and there a woman among them,
so fill up the streets that it is no easy matter to navigate one’s way. Notwithstanding
all these obstructions, it is worthy of note and highly praiseworthy
to see these crowds pass and repass with the greatest rapidity in the narrow
streets without altercation or disturbance, and seldom with accident.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p></div>

<p>Streets at the north present a somewhat different, and on the
whole a less inviting because less entertaining and picturesque
aspect. Their greater width allows carts to pass, and it also
offers more room for the garbage, the rubbish, and the noisome
sights that are most disgusting, all of which are made worse in
rainy weather by the mud through which one flounders. Barrow
thus delineates those in Peking: “The multitude of movable
workshops of tinkers and barbers, cobblers and blacksmiths,
the tents and booths where tea and fruit, rice and other eatables
were exposed for sale, with the wares and merchandise arrayed
before the doors, had contracted this spacious street to a narrow
road in the middle, just wide enough for two little vehicles to
pass each other. The processions of men in office attended by
their numerous retinues, bearing umbrellas and flags, painted
lanterns and a variety of strange insignia of their rank and
station, different trains that were accompanying, with lamentable
cries, corpses to their graves, and with squalling music, brides
to their husbands; the troops of dromedaries laden with coals
from Tartary; the wheel-barrows and hand-carts stuffed with
vegetables, occupied nearly the whole of this middle space in
one continued line. All was in motion. The sides of the streets
were filled with an immense concourse of people, buying and
selling and bartering their different commodities. The buzz
and confused noises of this mixed multitude, proceeding from
the loud bawling of those who were crying their wares, the
wrangling of others, with every now and then a strange twanging
sound like the jarring of a cracked jewsharp (the barber’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[742]</a></span>
signal), the mirth and laughter that prevailed in every group,
could scarcely be exceeded. Peddlers with their packs, jugglers
and conjurers, fortune-tellers, mountebanks and quack doctors,
comedians and musicians, left no space unoccupied.”<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONTROL OF BEGGARS AND FIRES IN CITIES.</div>

<p>Shops are closed at nightfall, and persons going abroad carry
a lantern or torch. Over the thoroughfares slender towers are
erected, where notice of a fire is given and the watches of the
night announced by striking a gong. Few persons are met in
the streets at night, and the private watch kept by all who are
able greatly assists the regular police in preserving order and
apprehending thieves. These watchers go up and down their
wards beating large bamboos, to let “thieves know they are on
the lookout.” Considering all things, large Chinese cities are
remarkably quiet at night. Beggars find their lodgings in the
porches and squares of temples, or sides of the streets, and
nestle together for mutual warmth. This class is under the care
of a headman, who, in order to collect the poor-tax allowed by
law, apportions them in the neighborhoods with the advice of
the elders and constables. During the day they go from one
door to another and receive their allotted stipend, which cannot
be less than one cash to each person. They sit in the doorway
and sing a ditty or beat their clap-dishes and sticks to attract
attention, and if the shopkeeper has no customers he lets them
keep up their cries, for he knows that the longer they are detained
so much the more time will elapse before they come
again to his shop. Many are blind and all present a sickly
appearance, their countenances begrimed with dirt and furrowed
by sorrow and suffering. The very difficult question how to
assist, restrain, and employ the poor has been usually left to the
mercy and wisdom of the municipal officers in the cities; and
the results are not on the whole discreditable to their humanity
and benevolence. Many persons give the headman a dollar or
more per month to purchase exemption from the daily importunity
of the beggars, and families about to have a house-warming,
marriage, or funeral, as also newly arrived junks, are obliged
to fee him to get rid of the clamorous and loathsome crowd.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[743]</a></span></p>
<p>When fires occur the officers of government are held responsible;
the law being that if ten houses are burned <em>within
the walls</em>, the highest officer in it shall be fined nine months’
pay; if more than thirty, a year’s salary; and if three hundred
are consumed, he shall be degraded one degree. The governor
and other high officers, attended by a few troops, are frequently
seen at fires in Canton, as much to prevent thievery as
to direct in extinguishing the flames. The engines are hurried
through the narrow streets at a fearful rate; those who carry
away property are armed with swords to defend it, and usually
add to the crash of the burning houses by loud cries. The police
do not hesitate to pull down houses if the fire can thereby
be sooner extinguished, but there is no organized body of firemen,
nor any well-arranged system of operations in such cases,
though conflagrations are ordinarily soon under control. Cruel
men often take the opportunity at such times to steal and carry
off defenceless persons, especially young girls.</p>

<p>At Canton the usage is general of levying a bonus on the
owners of the houses adjacent to the burnt district, whose
dwellings were saved by the exertions of the firemen, the appraisement
decreasing as the distance increases; the sum is divided
among the firemen. The householders thus saved also
employ priests to erect an altar near by, whereon to perform a
service, and “return thanks for Heaven’s mercy.” On the
whole, the fire control in China is superior to that in Turkey,
where the firemen pay themselves for their efforts by extortions
practised upon house-owners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAGODAS, THEIR PURPOSE AND CONSTRUCTION.</div>

<p>The pagoda is a building considered as so peculiar to the
Chinese that a landscape or painting relating to China without a
pagoda perched on a hill&mdash;like one of Egyptian scenery destitute
of a pyramid&mdash;would be considered deficient. The term <i>pagoda</i>
is used in its proper sense by most of the French and Portuguese
writers to denote a temple for idols, but in English books it has
always been appropriated to the polygonal towers seen throughout
the country. Some confusion has arisen in consequence of applying
the account of an immense temple full of idols to these
towers. The English use is the most definite in China, although
its misapplication is indefensible if we regard its derivation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[744]</a></span></p>

<p>The form of the Chinese <i>tah</i> is probably derived from the
spire on the top of the Hindu dagoba, as its name is doubtless
taken from the first syllable; but their purpose has so long
been identified with the geomantic influences which determine
the luck of a place that the people do not associate them with
Buddhism. Mr. Milne explains this in his remark that “the
presence of such an edifice not only secures to the site the protection
of heaven, if it already bears evidence of enjoying it,
but represses any evil influences that may be native to the spot,
and imparts to it the most salutary and felicitous omens.”<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
Those in the southern and central provinces seldom contain
idols of any pretensions. They are ascended by stairways built
in the thick walls on alternate sides of the stories. In the
north there is another kind, designed to contain a <i>shé-lí</i>, or
relic of Buddha, having a large room near the base for worshipping
the idol placed in it, but otherwise entirely solid and
nearly uniform in size to the top; the stories are merely numerous
narrow projections, like eaves or string courses, on which
hundreds of small images are sometimes placed. These structures
more nearly resemble the Indian <i>dagoba</i> than the other
kind, and are always connected with a monastery, while those
are not uniformly so placed, though under a priestly oversight.</p>

<p>No town is considered complete without a pagoda, and many
large cities have several; there must be nearly two thousand in
the Empire, some of which are quite celebrated. It is rare to
see a new one, and the ruinous condition of most of them indicates
the weakness of the faith which erected them. They vary
in height from five to thirteen stories, and are mostly built in
so solid a manner that they are likely to remain for centuries.
One at Hangchau is octagonal, each face twenty-eight feet
wide and the wall at the base eighteen feet thick; the top is
reached by a spiral stairway between the walls; a covered gallery
on the outside of each story affords resting-places and ever-changing
views to the visitor; it is one hundred and seventy
feet high, and was built during the Sung dynasty, in the twelfth
century. The prospect from its summit is superb; the pic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[745]</a></span>turesque
combination of sea and shore, land and water, city and
country, wilderness, gardens, and hills, with many historical and
religious associations interesting to a native, make it one of the
most charming landscapes in China.</p>

<p>Sir John Davis visited one near Lintsing chau in Shantung,
in very good repair, inhabited by Buddhist priests, and containing
two idols; each of its nine stories was inscribed with <i>Ometo
Fuh</i>, in large characters. It was erected since the completion
of the Grand Canal. A winding stairway of near two hundred
steps conducted to the top, about one hundred and fifty feet
from the ground, from whence an extensive view was obtained
of the surrounding country. The basement was excellently
built of granite, and all the rest of glazed brick, beautifully
joined and cemented.</p>

<p>The objects in building these structures being of a mixed nature,
sometimes geomantic and sometimes religious, their materials,
size, and structure vary considerably. There are two inside
of Canton, and three near the Pearl River, below the city;
fifteen others occur in the prefecture. Suchau has two, Ningpo
one, Fuhchau two, and Peking six in and out of the walls.
One of those at Canton was built by the Moslems about a thousand
years ago, a plain brick tower nearly two hundred feet
high, from which the faithful were probably called to prayers in
the adjacent mosque. Fergusson’s remarks upon Chinese architecture
would probably have been modified had the writer enjoyed
a wider range of observation and a fuller knowledge of
the designs of native builders. They are, however, the conclusions
of a competent observer, and the position he gives to
the pagoda among the tower-like buildings of the world, arising
from its peculiar form, its divisions, and its apparent uselessness,
will be generally accepted as just.</p>

<p>Mr. Milne, in his interesting work, has a good account of pagodas;
he shows that while their model is of Hindu origin,
and has been carefully followed since the first one was erected
(about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 250) at Nanking, the popular geomantic ideas connected
with their octagonal form and great height have gradually
increased and influenced their location. The Buddhists
seem themselves to have lost their ancient confidence in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[746]</a></span>
protection of the <i>shé-lí</i> (or <i>saina</i>) supposed to be built in them.
The number of Indian words transliterated in Chinese accounts
of these edifices further proves their foreign origin. For convenience
and accuracy in describing them, it would be best to
restrict the term <i>pagoda</i> to the hollow octagonal towers, the
word <i>dagoba</i> to the solid ones covering the relics, and <i>tope</i> to
the erections over priests when buried.</p>

<p>Pagodas are sometimes made of cast iron; those hitherto observed
are in the central provinces. One exists in Chehkiang
province, nearly fifty feet high and of nine stories. The octagonal
pieces forming the walls are each single castings, as are also the
plates forming the roof. The whole structure, including the
base and spire, was made of twenty pieces of iron. Its interior
is filled with brick, probably with the design to strengthen it
against storms. The ignorance of the Chinese of later days of
the Hindu origin of pagodas has led to their regarding those
now in existence as of native design, and appropriated by the
Buddhists for their own ends. Most of them are falling to
ruins; and the assurances held out by the geomancers that the
pagoda will act like an electric tractor to draw down every
felicitous omen from above, so that fire, water, wood, earth, and
metal will be at the service of the people, the soil productive,
trade prosperous, and the natives submissive and happy, all fail
to call out funds for repairing them.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>The dull appearance of a Chinese city when seen from a distance
is unlike that of European cities, in which spires, domes, and
towers of churches and cathedrals, halls, palaces, and other public
buildings relieve the uniformity of rows of dwellings. In China,
temples, houses, and palaces are nearly of one height; their sameness
being only partially relieved by trees mingled with pairs of
tall flag-staffs with frames near their tops, which at a distance
rather suggest the idea of dismantled gallows. Nature, however,
charms and delights, and few countries present more beautiful
landscapes; even the tameness of the works of man serves as a
foil for the diversified beauties of the cultivated landscape.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Wheelbarrows Used for Travelling.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">MODES OF TRAVELLING.</div>

<p>A Chinese usually prefers to travel by water, and in the
southeastern provinces it may be said that vehicles solely designed
for carrying travellers or goods do not exist, for the carts
and wheelbarrows which are met with are few and miserably
made. But north of the Yangtsz’ River, all over the Great
Plain carts and wheelbarrows form the chief means of travel
and transportation. The high cost of timber and the bad roads
compel the people to make these vehicles very rude and strong,
having axles and wheels able to bear the strains or upsets which
befall them. Carts for goods are drawn by three or four horses
usually driven tandem, and fastened by long traces to the axle-tree,
one remaining within the thills. The common carts,
drawn by one or two mules, are oblong boxes fastened to an
axle, covered with cotton cloth, and cushioned to alleviate the
jolting; the passengers get in and out at the front, where the
driver sits close to the horse. In Peking the members of
the imperial clan and family are allowed to use carts having the
wheel behind the body; their ranks are further indicated by a
red or yellow covering, and a greater or less number of outriders
to escort them. The wheelbarrow is in great use for short
distances throughout the same region. The position of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[748]</a></span>
wheel in the centre enables the man to propel a heavy load
readily. When on a good road, and aided by a donkey, the larger
varieties of barrow carry easily a burden of a ton’s weight; two
men are necessary to maintain the balance and guide the rather
top-heavy vehicle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEDAN CHAIRS AND RIVER CRAFT.</div>

<p>Where travelling by water is impossible, sedan chairs are
used to carry passengers, and coolies with poles and slings transport
their luggage and goods. There are two kinds of sedan,
neither of them designed for reclining like the Indian <i>palky</i>.
The light one is made of bamboo, and so narrow that the sitter
is obliged to lean forward as he is carried; the large one, called
<i>kiao</i>, is, whether viewed in regard to lightness, comfort, or any
other quality associated with such a mode of carriage, one of the
most convenient articles found in any country. Its use is subject
to sumptuary laws, and forbidden to the common people
unless possessing some kind of rank. In Peking only the
highest officials ride in them, with four bearers. In other cities
two chairmen manage easily enough to maintain a gait of four
miles an hour with a sedan upon their shoulders. Goods are
carried upon poles, and however large or heavy the package may
be, the porters contrive to subdivide its weight between them
by means of their sticks and slings. The number of persons
who thus gain a livelihood is great, and in cities they are employed
by headmen, who contract for work just as carmen do
elsewhere; when unengaged by overseers, parties station themselves
at corners and other public places, ready to start at a beck,
after the manner of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dienstmänner</i> in German cities. In the
streets of Canton groups of brawny fellows are often seen idling
away their time in smoking, gambling, sleeping, or jeering at
the wayfarers; and, like the husbandmen mentioned in the
parable, if one ask them why they stand there all the day idle?
the answer will be, “Because no man hath hired us.”</p>

<p>The chair-bearers form a distinct guild in cities, and the
establishments where sedans and their bearers are to be hired
suggest a comparison with the livery stables of western cities;
the men, in fact, are nicknamed at Canton <i>mo mí ma</i>, ‘tailless
horses.’ A vehicle used sometimes by the Emperor and high
officers consists of an open chair set upon poles, so made that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[749]</a></span>
the incumbent can be seen as well as see around him. It
undergoes many changes in different parts of the country, as it
is both cheap and light and well fitted for traversing mountainous
regions.</p>

<p>In the construction and management of their river craft the
Chinese excel. As boats are intended to be the residences of
those who navigate them, regard is had to this in their arrangement.
Only a part of the fleets of boats seen on the river at
Canton are intended for transportation, a large number being
designed for fixed residences, and perhaps half of them are
permanently moored. They are not obliged to remain where
they station themselves, but the boats and their inmates are
both under the supervision of a water police, who register them
and point out the position they may occupy. Barges for families,
those in which oil, salt, fuel, or other articles are sold,
lighters, passage-boats, flower-boats, and other kinds, are by
this means grouped together, and more easily found. It was
once ascertained that there were eighty-four thousand boats
registered as belonging to the city of Canton, but whether all
remained near the city and did not go to other parts of the district,
or whether old ones were erased from the register when
broken up, was not determined. It is not likely, however, that
at one time this number of boats ever lay opposite the city.
No one who has been at Canton can forget the noisy, animating
sight the river offers, nor failed to have noticed the good-humored
carefulness with which boats of every size pass each
other without collision.</p>

<p>It is difficult to describe the many kinds of craft found on
Chinese waters without the assistance of drawings. They are
furnished with stern sculls moving upon a pivot, and easily propelling
the boat. Large boats are furnished with two or three
of these, which, when not in use, are conveniently hauled in
upon the side. They are provided with oars, the loom and
blade of which are fastened by withs, and work through a band
attached to a stake; the rower stands up and pushes his oar
with the same motion as that employed by the Venetian gondolier.
Occasionally an oarsman is seen rowing with his feet.
The mast in some large cargo boats consists of two sticks, rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[750]</a></span>ing
on the gunwales, joined at top, and so arranged as to be
hoisted from the bow; in those designed for residences no provision
is made for a mast. Fishing boats, lighters, and sea-going
craft have one or two permanent masts. In all, except
the smallest, a wale or frame projects from the side, on which
the boatmen walk when poling the vessel. The sails in the
south are woven of strips of matting, sewed into a single sheet,
and provided with yards at the top and bottom; the bamboo
ribs crossing it serve to retain the hoops that run on the mast,
and enable the boatmen to haul them close on the wind. A
driver is sometimes placed on the taffrail, and a small foresail
near the bow, but the mainsail is the chief dependence. No
Chinese boat has a bowsprit, and very few are coppered, or
have two decks, further than an orlop in the stern quarter in
which to stow provisions; no dead-lights give even a glimmer
to these recesses, which are necessarily small.</p>

<p>The internal arrangement of dwelling-boats is simple. The
better sort are from sixty to eighty feet long, and about fifteen
wide, divided into three rooms; the stem is sharp, and upholds
a platform on which, when they are moored alongside, it is
easy to pass from one boat to another. Each one is secured by
ropes to large hawsers which run along the whole line at the
bow and stern. The room nearest the bow serves for a lobby
to the principal apartment, which occupies about half the body
of the boat; the two are separated by trellis bulkheads, but the
sternmost room, or sleeping apartment, is carefully screened.
Cooking and washing are performed on a high stern framework,
which is admirably contrived, by means of furnaces and other
conveniences above and hatches and partitions below deck, to
serve all these purposes, contain all the fuel and water necessary,
and answer for a sleeping place as well. By means of
awnings and frameworks the top of the boat also subserves
many objects of work or pleasure. The window-shutters are
movable, fitted for all kinds of weather and for flexibility of
arrangement, meeting all the demands of a family and the particular
service of a vessel; nothing can be more ingenious.</p>

<p>The handsomest of these craft are called <i>hwa ting</i>, or flower-boats,
and are let to parties for pleasure excursions on the river;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[751]</a></span>
a large proportion of them are also the abodes of public women.
The smaller sorts at Canton are generally known as <i>tankia</i>
boats; they are about twenty-five feet long, contain only one
room, and are fitted with moveable mats to cover the whole
vessel; they are usually rowed by women. In these “egg-houses”
whole families are reared, live, and die; the room which
serves for passengers by day is a bedroom by night; a kitchen
at one time, a washroom at another, and a nursery always.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DWELLERS ON THE WATER.</div>

<p>As to this custom of living upon the water, we have an
interesting testimony of its practice so far back as the fourteenth
century, from the letter of a Dominican Friar in 1330. “The
realm of Cathay,” writes the missionary, “is peopled passing
well.... And there be many great rivers and great
sheets of water throughout the Empire; insomuch that a good
half of the realm and its territory is under water. And on
these waters dwell great multitudes of people because of the
vast population that there is in the said realm. They build
wooden houses upon boats, and so their houses go up and down
upon the waters; and the people go trafficking in their houses
from one province to another, whilst they dwell in these houses
with all their families, with their wives and children, and all
their household utensils and necessaries. And so they live
upon the waters all the days of their life. And there the
women be brought to bed, and do everything else just as people
do who dwell upon dry land.”<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to particularize the various sorts of lighters
or <i>chop-boats</i> found along the southern coast, the passenger
boats plying from town to town along the hundreds of streams,
and the smacks, revenue cutters, and fishing craft to be seen in
all waters, except to call attention to their remarkable adaptation
for the ends in view. The best sorts are made in the
southern provinces; those seen at Tientsin or Niuchwang suffer
by comparison for cleanliness, safety, and speed, owing partly
to the high price of wood and the less use made of them for
dwellings. On the head waters of the River Kan the boats are
of a peculiarly light construction, with upper works entirely of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[752]</a></span>
matting, and the hull like a crescent, well fitted to encounter
the rapids and rocks which beset their course.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REVENUE BOATS AND JUNKS.</div>

<p>Besides these various kinds the revenue service employs a
narrow, sharp-built boat, propelled by forty or fifty rowers,
armed with swivels, spears, boarding-hooks, and pikes, and
lined on the sides with a menacing array of rattan shields
painted with tigers’ heads. Smugglers have similarly made
boats, and now and then imitate the government boats in their
appearance, which, on their part, often compete with them in
smuggling. In 1863 the imperial government was induced to
adopt a national flag for all its own vessels, which will no doubt
gradually extend to merchant craft. It is triangular in shape,
and has a dragon with the head looking upward. It is usual
for naval officers to exhibit long yellow flags with their official
titles at full length; the vessels under them are distinguished
by various pennons. Junks carry a great assortment of flags,
triangular and square, of white, red, and other colors, most of
them bearing inscriptions. The number of governmental boats
and war junks, and those used for transporting the revenue and
salt, is proportionately very small; but if all the craft found on
the rivers and coasts of China be included, their united tonnage
perhaps equals that of all other nations put together. The
dwellers on the water near Canton are not, as has been sometimes
said, debarred from living ashore. A boat can be built
cheaper than a brick house, and is equally comfortable; it is
kept clean easier, pays no ground-rent, and is not so obnoxious
to fire and thieves. Most of them are constructed of fir or pine
and smeared with wood oil; the seams are caulked with rattan
shavings and paid over with a cement of oil and gypsum. The
sailing craft are usually flat-bottomed, sharp forward, and guided
by an enormous rudder which can be hoisted through the open
stern sheets when in shallow waters. The teak-wood anchors
have iron-bound flukes, held by coir or bamboo hawsers&mdash;now
often replaced by iron chain and grapnel.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[753]</a></span></p>
<p>The old picturesque junk, with its bulging hull, high stern,
and great eyes on the bow, is rapidly disappearing before
steamers. Its original model is said to be a huge sea monster;
the teeth at the cutwater and top of the bow define its mouth,
the long boards on each side of the bow form the armature of
the head, the eyes being painted on them, the masts and sails
are the fins, and the high stern is the tail frisking aloft. The
cabins look more like niches in a sepulchre than the accommodations
for a live passenger. The crew live upon deck most of
the time, and are usually interested in the trade of the vessel
or an adventure of their own. The hold is divided into water-tight
compartments, a contrivance that has its advantages when
the vessel strikes a rock, but prevents her carrying a cargo
comparable to her size. The great number of passengers which
have been stowed in these vessels entailed a frightful loss of
life when they were wrecked. In February, 1822, Capt. Pearl,
of the English ship Indiana, coming through Gaspar Straits,
fell in with the cargo and crew of a wrecked junk, and saved
one hundred and ninety-eight persons (out of one thousand six
hundred with whom she had left Amoy), whom he landed at
Pontianak; this humane act cost him $55,000.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BRIDGES IN CHINA.</div>

<p>Among secondary architectural works deserving notice are
bridges and honorary portals. There is good reason for supposing
that the Chinese have been acquainted with the arch
from very early times, though they make comparatively little
use of it. Certain bridges have pointed arches, others have
semicircular, and others approach the form of a horse-shoe, the
transverse section of an ellipse, or even like the Greek Ω, the
space being widest at the top. In some the arch is high for
the accommodation of boats passing beneath; and where no heavy
wains or carriages cross and jar the fabric, it can safely be made
light. A graceful specimen of this class is the structure seen in
the illustration on page <a href="#i_f754">754</a>. This bridge, though serving no
practical purpose, is one of the greatest ornaments about the
Emperor’s summer palace of Yuen-ming Yuen. The material
is marble; its summit is reached by forty steps rising abruptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[754]</a></span>
from the causeway, and impracticable, of course, for any but
pedestrians.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Bridge in Wan-shao Shan Gardens, near Peking.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The balustrades and paving of the long marble bridges near
Peking and Hangchau, some of them adorned with statues of
elephants, lions, and other animals, present a pleasing effect,
while their solidity and endurance of freshes running over the
top at times attest the skill of the architects. Wooden bridges
furnish means for crossing small streams in all parts of the land;
when the river is powerful, or the rise and fall of the tide great,
it is crossed on boats fastened together, with contrivances for
drawing out two or three in the centre when the passing craft
demand a passage. At Tientsin, Ningpo, and other cities, this
means of crossing entails little delay in comparison to its cheapness.
Some of the bridges in and about Peking are beautiful
structures; their erection, however, presented no difficult problem,
while that at Fuhchau was a greater feat of engineering.
It is about four hundred yards long and five wide, consisting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[755]</a></span>
nearly forty solid buttresses of hewn stone placed at unequal distances
and joined by slabs of granite; some of these slabs are
three feet square and forty-five feet long. They support a granite
pavement. The bridge was formerly lined with shops, which the
increased traffic has caused to be removed. Another similar bridge
lies seven miles north of it on the River Min, and a third of equal
importance at the city of Chinchew, north of Amoy. Some
of the mountain streams and passes in the west and north are
crossed by rope bridges of ingenious construction, and by chain
suspension bridges.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowrie describes a bridge at Changchau, near Amoy, and
these structures are more numerous in the eastern provinces than
elsewhere. “It is built on twenty-five piles of stone about thirty
feet apart, and perhaps twenty feet each in height. Large round
beams are laid from pile to pile, and smaller ones across in the
simplest and rudest manner; earth is then placed above these
and the top paved with brick and stone. One would suppose
that the work had been assigned to a number of different persons,
and that each one had executed his part in such manner
as best suited his own fancy, there being no regularity whatever
in the paving. Bricks and stone were intermingled in the most
confused manner, and the railing was here wood and there stone.
We were particularly struck with the length of some of the granite
stones used in paving the bridge; one was eight, another eleven,
and three others eighteen paces, or about forty-five feet long, and
two broad. The bridge averaged eight or ten feet in width, and
about half its length on both sides was occupied by shops.”<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>A causeway of ninety arches crosses a feeder of the Grand
Canal near Hangchau. The stones for the arch in one bridge
noticed by Barrow were cut so as to form a segment of the
arch, and at each end were mortised into transverse blocks of
stone stretching across the bridge; they decreased in length from
ten feet at the spring of the arch to three at the vertex, and the
summit stone was mortised, like the rest, into two transverse
blocks lying next to it.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> The tenons were short, and the dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[756]</a></span>position
of the principal pieces such that a bridge built in this
way would not support great weights or endure many ages.
The mode of placing the pieces can be seen in the cut. In other
instances the stones are laid in the same manner as in Europe;
many small bridges over creeks and canals have cambered or
straight arches. When one of these structures falls into ruins
or becomes dangerous, the people seldom bestir themselves to
repair the damage, preferring to wait for the government; they
thereby lose the benefit of self-dependence and action.</p>

<p>It is singular how the term <i>triumphal arch</i> came to be applied
to the <i>pai-fang</i> and <i>pai-lau</i>, or honorary portals or tablets, of the
Chinese; for a triumph was perhaps never heard of in that
country, and these structures are never arched. They consist
merely of a broad gateway flanked with two smaller ones, and
suggest a turnpike gate with side-ways for foot passengers rather
than a triumphal monument. They are scattered in great numbers
over the provinces, and are erected in honor of distinguished
persons, or by officers to commemorate their parents, by special
favor from the Emperor. Some are put up in honor of women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">[757]</a></span>
who have distinguished themselves for their chastity and filial
duty, or to widows who have refused a second marriage. Permission
to erect them is considered a high honor, and perhaps
the term <i>triumphal</i> was given them from this circumstance.
The economical and peaceful nature of such honors conferred
upon distinguished men in China is most characteristic; a man
is allowed to build a stone gateway to himself or his parents,
and the Emperor furnishes the inscription, or perhaps sends
with it a patent of nobility. Their general arrangement is exhibited
in the <a href="#Illustration_THE_MK">title-page</a> of this work; the two characters, <i>shing
chí</i>, at the top, meaning ‘sacred will,’ intimate that it was erected
by his Majesty’s permission.</p>

<p>Some of the <i>pai-lau</i> are elaborately ornamented with carved
work and inscriptions; and as a protection to the frieze a ponderous
covering of tiles projects over the top, which, however,
exposes the structure to injury from tempests. They are placed
in conspicuous places in the outskirts of towns, and in the streets
before temples or near government edifices. Travellers looking
for what they had read about have sometimes strangely mistaken
the gateways at the heads of streets or the entrance to
temples for the honorary portals.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Those built of stone are
fastened by mortises and tenons in the same manner as the
wooden ones; they seldom exceed twenty or twenty-five feet in
height. The skill and taste displayed in the symmetry and
carving upon some of them are creditable; but as the man in
whose honor it is erected is, generally speaking, “the architect
of his own fame,” he prudently considers the worth of that
commodity, and makes an inferior structure to what would have
been done if his fellow-subjects, “deeply sensible of the honor,”
had come together to appoint a committee and open a subscription
list for the purpose. Among the numerous <i>pai-lau</i> in and
near Peking, two or three deserve mention for their beauty.
One lies in the Confucian Temple in front of the <i>Pih-yung
Kung</i>, and is designed to enhance the splendor of its approach
by presenting, as it were, a frame before its façade. It is built
of stone and overlaid with square encaustic tiles of many hues.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[758]</a></span>
The arrangement of the colors, the carving on the marble, and
the fine proportions of the structure render it altogether one of
the most artistic objects in China. Another like it is built in
the Imperial Park, but the position is not so advantageous.
Fergusson points out the similarity between these <i>pai-lau</i> and
certain Hindu gateways, and claims that India furnished the
model. The question of priority is hardly susceptible of proof;
but his fancy that a large <i>pai-lau</i> in a street of Amoy presented
a simulated coffin on it above the principal cornice, leads us to
suspect that he was looking for what was never in the builder’s
mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MILITARY ARCHITECTURE&mdash;DRESS.</div>

<p>The construction of forts and towers presents little worthy of
observation, since there is no other evidence of science than what
the erection of lines of massive stone wall displays. The port-holes
are too large for protection and the parapet too slight to
resist modern missiles. The Chinese idea of a fortification is
a wall along the water’s edge, with embrasures and battlements,
and a plain wall landward without port-holes or parapets, enclosing
an area in which a few houses accommodate the garrison
and ammunition. Some erected at the junction of streams are
pierced on all sides; others are so unscientifically planned that
the walls can be scaled at angles where not a single gun can be
brought to bear. The towers are rectangular edifices of brick
on a stone foundation, forty feet square and fifty or sixty high,
to be entered by ladders through a door half way up the side.</p>

<p>The forts in the neighborhood of Canton, probably among
the best in the Empire, are all constructed without fosse, bastion,
glacis, or counter-defence of any kind. Both arrangement and
placement are alike faulty: some are square and approachable
without danger; others circular on the outer face but with flank
or rear exposed; others again built on a hillside like a pound, so
that the garrison, if dislodged from the battlements, are forced
to fly up the slope in full range of their enemy’s fire. The gate
is on the side, unprotected by ditch, drawbridge, or portcullis,
and poorly defended by guns upon the walls or in the area
behind. In general the points chosen for their forts display
a misapprehension of the true principles of defence, though
some may be noted as occupying commanding positions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[759]</a></span></p>

<p>In recent times mud defences and batteries of sand-bags have
proved a much safer defence than such buildings against ships
and artillery, and show the aptitude of the people to adopt practical
things. Though not particularly resolute on the field, the
Chinese soldier stands well to his guns when behind a fortification
of whose strength he is assured. The forts which have recently
been constructed under supervision of European engineers are
rapidly taking the place of native works in all parts of the
country.</p>

<p>Dress, like other things, undergoes its changes in China, and
fashions alter there as well as elsewhere, but they are not as
rapid or as striking as among European nations. The full costume
of both sexes is, in general terms, commodious and graceful,
combining all the purposes of warmth, beauty, and ease
which could be desired, excepting always the shaven crown and
braided queue of the men and the crippled feet of the women,
in both of which fashions they have not less outraged nature
than deformed themselves. On this point different tastes exist,
and some prefer the close-fitting dress of Europeans to the loose
robes of Asiatics; but when one has become in a measure
habituated to the latter, one is willing to allow the force of the
criticism that the European male costume is “a mysterious combination
of the inconvenient and the unpicturesque: hot in summer
and cold in winter, useless for either keeping off rain or
sun, stiff but not plain, bare without being simple, not durable,
not becoming, and not cheap.” The Chinese dress has remained,
in its general style, the same for centuries; and garments of fur
or silk are handed down from parent to child without fear of
attracting attention by their antique shapes. The fabrics most
worn are silk, cotton, and grass-cloth for summer, with the addition
of furs and skins in winter; woollen is used sparingly, and
almost wholly of foreign manufacture.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Barber’s Establishment, showing also the Dress of the Common People.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">VARIETY AND MATERIAL OF APPAREL.</div>

<p>The principal articles of dress are inner and outer tunics of
various lengths made of cotton or silk, reaching below the loins
or to the feet; the lapel on the right side folds over the breast
and fits close about the neck, which is left uncovered. The
sleeves are much wider and longer than the arms, have no cuffs
or facings, and in common cases serve for pockets. A Chinese,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[760]</a></span>
instead of saying “he pocketed the book,” would say “he sleeved
it.” In robes of ceremony the end of the sleeve resembles a
horse’s hoof, and good breeding requires the hand to be kept in
a position to exhibit the cuff when sitting. In warm weather
one upper garment is deemed sufficient; in winter a dozen can
be put on without discommodity, and this number is sometimes
actually seen upon persons engaged in sedentary employments,
or on those who sit in the air. Latterly, underwear of flannel
has become common among the better dressed, who like the
knitted fabric so close-fitting and warm. The lower limbs are
comparatively slightly protected; a pair of loose trousers, covered
to the knee by cloth stockings, is the usual summer garment;
tight leggings are pulled over both in winter and attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[761]</a></span>
the girdle by loops; and as the trousers are rather voluminous
and the tunic short, the excess shows behind from under these
leggings in a rather unpleasant manner. Gentlemen and officers
always wear a robe with the skirt opened at the sides, which
conceals this intermission of the under apparel. The colors preferred
for outer garments are various hues of buff, purple, or
blue.</p>

<p>The shoes are made of silk or cotton, usually embroidered for
women’s wear in red and other colors. The soles are of felt,
sometimes of paper inside a rim of felt, and defended on the
bottom by hide. These shoes keep the feet dry and unchilled
on the tiles or ground, so that a Chinese may be said really to
carry the floor of his house under his feet instead of laying it
on the ground. The thick soles render it necessary for ease in
walking to round up their ends, which constrains the toes into
an elevated position so irksome that all go slipshod who conveniently
can do so. The cost of a cotton suit need not exceed
five dollars, and a complete silken one, of the gayest colors and
best materials, can easily be procured for twenty-five or thirty.
Quilted cotton garments are exceedingly common, and are so
made as to protect the whole person from the cold and obviate
the need of fires. In the north dressed sheepskin robes furnish
bedding as well as garments, and their durability will long make
them more desirable than woven fabrics.</p>

<p>The ancient Chinese wore the hair long, bound upon the top
of the head, somewhat after the style of the Lewchewans; and
taking pride in its glossy black, called themselves the <i>black-haired
race</i>. But in 1627 the Manchus, then in possession of only
Liautung, issued an order that all Chinese under them should
adopt their coiffure as a sign of allegiance, on penalty of death;
the fashion thus begun by compulsion is now followed from
choice. The fore part of the head is shaved to the crown and
the hair braided in a single plait behind. Laborers often wind
it about the head or knot it into a ball out of the way when
barebacked or at work. The size of the queue can be enlarged
by permitting an additional line of hair to grow; the appearance
it gives the wearer is thus described by Mr. Downing, and the
quotation is not an unfair specimen of the remarks of travellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[762]</a></span>
upon China: “At the hotel one of the waiters was dressed in
a peculiar manner about the head. Instead of the hair being
shaved in front, he had it cut round the top of the forehead
about an inch and a half in length. All the other part was
turned as usual and plaited down the back. This thin semi-circular
ridge of hair was then made to stand bolt upright, and as
each hair was separate and stiff as a bristle, the whole looked
like a very fine-toothed comb turned upward. This I imagined
to be the usual way of dressing the head by single unengaged
youths, and of course must be very attractive.” Thus what the
wearer regarded as ill-looking, and intended to braid in as soon
as it was long enough, is here taken as a device for beautifying
himself in the eyes of those he never saw or cared to see.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Tricks Played with the Queue.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The people are vain of a long thick queue, and now and then
play each other tricks with it, as well as use it as a ready means
for correction; but nothing irritates them more than to cut it off.
Men and women oftener go bareheaded than covered, warding
off the sun by means of a fan; in winter felt or silk skull-caps,
hoods, and fur protect them from cold. Laborers shelter themselves
from rain under an umbrella hat and a grotesque thatch-work
of leaves neatly sewn upon a coarse network&mdash;very effectual
for the purpose. In illustration of the remark at the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[763]</a></span>
of this chapter, it might be added that if they were not worn
on the head such hats would be called trays, so unlike are they
to the English article of that name. The formal head-dress is
the conical straw or felt hat so peculiar to this nation, usually
covered with a red fringe of silk or hair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OFFICIAL COSTUMES.</div>

<p>The various forms, fabrics, colors, and ornaments of the dresses
worn by grades of officers are regulated by sumptuary laws.
Citron-yellow distinguishes the imperial family, but his Majesty’s
apparel is less showy than many of his courtiers, and in all
that belongs to his own personal use there is an appearance of
disregard of ornament. The five-clawed dragon is figured upon
the dress and whatever pertains to the Emperor, and in certain
things to members of his family. The monarchs of China formerly
wore a sort of flat-topped crown, shaped somewhat like
a Cantab’s cap, and having a row of jewels pendent from each
side. The summer bonnet of officers is made of finely woven
straw covered with a red fringe; in winter it is trimmed with
fur. A string of beads hanging over an embroidered robe, a
round knob on the cap, thick-soled satin boots, two or three
pouches for fans or chopsticks, and occasionally a watch or two
hanging from the girdle, constitute the principal points of difference
between the official and plebeian costume. No company
of men can appear more splendid than a large party of officers
in their winter robes made of fine, lustrous crapes, trimmed
with rich furs and brilliant with gay embroidery. In winter a
silk or fur spencer is worn over the robe, and forms a handsome
and warm garment. Lambskins are much used, and the downy
coats of unyeaned lambs, which, with the finer furs and the
skins of hares, wild cats, rabbits, foxes, wolves, otter, squirrels,
etc., are worn by all ranks. Some years ago a lad used to
parade the streets of Canton, who presented an odd appearance
in a long spencer made of a tiger’s skin. The Chinese like
strong contrasts in the colors of their garments, sometimes wearing
yellow leggings underneath a light blue robe, itself set off by
a purple spencer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COSTUMES OF CHINESE WOMEN.</div>

<p>The dress of women is likewise liable to few fluctuations, and
all ranks can be sure that the fashion will last as long as the
gown. The garments of both sexes among the common people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[764]</a></span>
resemble each other more than in Western Asia. The tunic or
short gown is open in front, buttoning around the neck and under
the arm, reaching to the knee, like a smock-frock in its general
shape. The trousers among the lower orders are usually worn
over the stockings, both being covered, on ceremonial occasions,
by a petticoat reaching to the feet. Laboring women, whose
feet are left their natural size, go barefoot or slipshod in the
warm latitudes, but cover their feet carefully farther north.
Both sexes have a paucity of linen in their habiliments&mdash;if not
a shiftless, the Chinese certainly are a shirtless race, and such
undergarments as they have are not too often washed.</p>

<p>The head-dress of married females is becoming and even elegant.
The copious black hair is bound upon the head in an
oval-formed knot, which is secured in its place and shape by a
broad pin placed lengthwise on it, and fastened by a shorter one
thrust across and under the bow. The hair is drawn back from
the forehead into the knot, and elevated a little in front by combing
it over the finger; in order to make it lie smooth the locks
are drawn through resinous shavings moistened in warm water,
which also adds an extra gloss, at the cost, however, of injury
to the hair. In front of the knot a tube is often inserted, in
which flowers can be placed. The custom of wearing them is
nearly universal, fresh blossoms being preferred when obtainable,
and artificial at other times. Having no covering on the head
there is more opportunity than in the west to display pretty
devices in arranging the hair. A widow is known by her white
flowers, a maiden by one or two plaits instead of a knot, and so
on; in their endless variety of form and ornament, Chinese
women’s head-dresses furnish a source of constant study. Mr.
Stevens tells us that the animated appearance of the dense crowd
which assembled on the bridge and banks of the river at Fuhchau
when he passed in 1835, was still more enlivened by the
flowers worn by the women.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>PROCESSION OF LADIES TO AN ANCESTRAL TEMPLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Matrons wear an embroidered fillet on the forehead, an inch
or more wide, pointed between the eyebrows, and covering the
front of the hair though not concealing the baldness which often
comes on early from the resinous bandoline used. This fillet
is embroidered, or adorned with pearls, a favorite ornament with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[765]</a></span>
Chinese ladies. The women along the Yangtsz’ River wear a
band of fur around the head, which relieves their colorless complexions.
A substitute for bonnets is common in summer, consisting
of a flat piece of straw trimmed with a fringe of blue
cloth. The hair of children is unbound, but girls more advanced
allow the side locks to reach to the waist and plait a tress down
the neck; their coarse hair does not curl, and the beautiful
luxuriance of curls and ringlets seen in Europe is entirely unknown.
False hair is made use of by both sexes, the men being
particularly fond of eking out their queues to the fullest length.
Gloves are not worn, the long sleeves being adequate for warmth;
in the north the ears are protected from freezing by ear-tabs lined
with fur, and often furnished with a tiny looking-glass on the
outside.</p>

<p>The dress of gentlewomen, like that of their husbands, is
regulated by sumptuary laws, but none of these prevent their
costumes from being as splendid as rich silks, gay colors, and
beautiful embroidery can make them. The neck of the robe is
protected by a stiff band, and the sleeves are large and long,
just the contrary of the common style, which being short allows
the free use and display of a well-turned arm. The official embroidery
allowed to the husband is changed to another kind on
his wife’s robe indicative of the same rank. No belt or girdle
is seen, nor do stays compress the waist to its lasting injury.
One of the prettiest parts of a lady’s dress is the petticoat, which
appears about a foot below the upper robe covering the feet.
Each side of the skirt is plaited about six times, and in front
and rear are two pieces of buckram to which they are attached;
the plaits and front pieces are stiffened with wire and lining.
Embroidery is worked upon these two pieces and the plaits in
such a way that as the wearer steps the action of the feet
alternately opens and shuts them on each side, disclosing a part
or the whole of two different colored figures, as may be seen in
the <a href="#i_f764b">illustration</a>. The plaits are so contrived that they are the
same when seen in front or from behind, and the effect is more
elegant when the colors are well contrasted. In order to produce
this the plaits close around the feet, unlike the wider skirt
of western ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[766]</a></span></p>

<p>Ornaments are less worn by the Chinese than other Asiatic
nations. The men suspend a string of fragrant beads together
with the tobacco-pouch from the jacket lapel, or occasionally
wear seal-rings, finger-rings, and armlets of strass, stone, or
glass. They are by law prohibited from carrying weapons of
any sort. The women wear bangles, bracelets, and ear-rings of
glass, stone, and metal; most of these appendages are regarded
more as amulets to ward off evil influences than mere ornaments.
Felicitous charms, such as aromatic bags, old coins,
and rings, are attached to the persons of children, and few
adults venture to go through life without some preservative of
this kind; no sacred thread or daub of clay, as in India, is
known, however, nor any image of a saint or other figurine, as
in Romish countries. The queer custom of wearing long nails
is practised by comparatively few; and although a man or
woman with these appendages would not be deemed singular, it
is not regarded as in good taste by well-bred persons. Pedantic
scholars wear them more than other professions, in order to
show that they are above manual labor; but the longest set the
writer ever saw was, oddly enough, on a carpenter’s fingers, who
thereby showed that he was not obliged to use his tools. Fine
ladies protect theirs with silver sheaths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANNER OF COMPRESSING THE FEET.</div>

<p>The practice of compressing the feet, so far as investigation
has gone, is more an inconvenient than a dangerous custom, for
among the many thousands of patients who have received aid
in the missionary hospitals, few have presented themselves with
ailments chargeable to this source. A difference of opinion
exists respecting its origin. Some accounts state that it arose
from a desire thereby to remove the reproach of the club feet
of a popular empress, others that it gradually came into use
from the great admiration of and attempt to imitate delicate
feet, and others that it was imposed by husbands to keep their
wives from gadding.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Its adoption was gradual, however it may
have commenced, and not without resistance. It is practised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[767]</a></span>
by all classes of society except the Manchus and Tartars, poor as
well as rich (for none are so poor as not to wish to be fashionable);
and so habituated does one become to it after a residence
in the country, that a well-dressed lady with large feet seems
to be denationalized. There is no certain age at which the
operation must be commenced, but in families of easy circumstances
the bandages are put on before five; otherwise not until
betrothment, or till seven or eight years old. The whole operation
is performed, and the shape maintained, by bandages,
which are never permanently removed or covered by stockings;
iron or wooden shoes are not used, the object being rather to
prevent the feet growing
than to make them
smaller.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Appearance of the Bones of a Foot when Compressed.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A good account of
the effects of this practice
is given in a paper
contained in the <cite>Transactions
of the Royal Society
of London</cite>, written
by Dr. Cooper,
detailing the appearances
presented on dissection.
The foot belonged
to a person in low life; it was five and one-fourth inches
long, which is full eighteen lines over the most fashionable size.
The big toe was bent upward and backward on the foot, and the
second twisted under it and across, so that the extremity reached
the inner edge of the foot. The third toe somewhat overlapped
the second, but lying less obliquely, and reaching to the first joint
of the great toe. The ball of the great toe, much flattened,
separated these two from the fourth and fifth toes. The fourth
toe stretched obliquely inward under the foot, but less so than
the little toe, which passed under and nearly across the foot, and
had been bound down so strongly as to bend the tarsal bone. The
dorsum of the foot was much curved, and a deep fissure crossed
the sole and separated the heel and little toe, as if the two ends
of the foot had been forced together; this was filled for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[768]</a></span>
inches with a very condensed cellular tissue; the instep was
three and one-half inches high. The heel-bone, which naturally
forms a considerable angle with the ankle, was in a direct line
with the leg-bones; and the heel itself was large and flat,
covered with a peculiarly dense integument, and forming, with
the end of the metatarsal bone of the great toe and the two
smallest toes bent under the sole, the three points of taction in
walking. When the operation is begun earlier, and the bones
are more flexible, four of the toes are bent under the foot and
only the big toe laid upon the top. The development of the
muscles of the calf being checked, the leg tapers from the knee
downward, though there is no particular weakness in the limb.
The appearance of the deformed member when uncovered is
shocking, crushed out of all
proportion and beauty, and
covered with a wrinkled and
lifeless skin like that of a
washerwoman’s hand. It is
surprising how the circulation
is kept up in the member
without any pain or wasting
away; the natural supposition
would be that if any nutriment
was conveyed to it, there would
be a disposition to grow until maturity was attained, and consequently
constant pain ensue, or else that it would be destroyed
or mortify for want of nourishment.</p>

<p>The gait of these victims of fashion can be imitated by a
person walking on the heels. Women walking alone swing
their arms and step quick and short, elderly women availing
themselves, when practicable, of an umbrella, or leaning upon
the shoulder of a lad or maid for support&mdash;literally making a
walking-stick of them. The pain is said to be severe at first,
and a recurrence now and then is felt in the sole; but the evident
freedom from distress exhibited in the little girls who are
seen walking or playing in the streets, proves that the amount
of suffering and injurious effects upon life and health are perhaps
not so great as has been imagined. The case is different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[769]</a></span>
when the girl is not victimized until ten or more years old. The
toes are then bent under and the foot forced into the smallest
compass; the agony arising from the constrained muscles and
excoriated flesh is dreadful, while, too, the shape of the member
is, even in Chinese eyes, a burlesque upon the beautiful littleness
so much desired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PREVALENCE OF THE FASHION.&mdash;LADIES’ SHOES.</div>

<p>The opinion prevails abroad that only the daughters of the
rich or learned pay this price to Dame Fashion. A greater
proportion is indeed found among the well-to-do classes, and
in the southern provinces near the rivers the unfashionables
form perhaps half of the whole; for those who dwell in boats,
and all who in early life may have lived on the water or among
the farmsteads, and slave girls sold in infancy for domestics, are
usually left in the happy though low-life
freedom of nature. Close observation in
the northern provinces show general adoption
of the usage among the poor, whose
feet are not, however, usually so small as
in the south. Foreigners, on their arrival
at Canton or Fuhchau, seeing so many
women with natural feet on the boats and
about the streets, wonder where the “little-footed
Celestials” they had heard of were,
the only specimens they see being a few
crones by the wayside mending clothes. Across the Mei ling
range the proportion increases. All the women who came
to the hospital at Chusan in 1841, to the number of eight hundred
or one thousand, had their feet more or less cramped; and
some of them walked several miles to the hospital and home again
the same day. Although the operation may be less painful than
has been represented, the people are so much accustomed to it
that most men would refuse to wed a woman whose feet were
of the natural size; and a man who should find out that his
bride had large feet when he expected small ones would be exonerated
if he instantly sent her back to her parents. The <i>kin
lien</i>, or ‘golden lilies,’ are desired as the mark of gentility; the
hope of rising to be one of the upper ten, and escaping the
roughness and hard work attached to the lower class, goes far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[770]</a></span>
to strengthen even children to endure the pain and loss of freedom
consequent on the practice. The secret of the prevalence
of the cruel custom is the love of ease and praise; and not till
the principles of Christianity extend will it cease. In Peking,
where the Manchus have shown the advantages nature has over
fashion, the example of their women for two hundred and fifty
years, aided by the earnest efforts of the great Emperor Kanghí,
has not had the least effect in inducing Chinese ladies to give
it up. The shoes are made of red silk and prettily embroidered;
but no one acquainted with Chinese society would say that “if
a lady ever breaks through the prohibition against displaying
her person, she presents her feet as the surest darts with which
a lover’s heart can be assailed!”<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>Cosmetics are used by females to the serious injury of the
skin. On grand occasions the face is entirely bedaubed with
white paint, and rouge is added to the lips and cheeks, giving a
singular starched appearance to the physiognomy. A girl thus
beautified has no need of a fan to hide her blushes, for they
cannot be seen through the paint, her eye being the only index
of emotion. The eyebrows are blackened with charred sticks,
and arched or narrowed to resemble a nascent willow leaf, or
the moon when first seen&mdash;as in the ballad translated by Mr.
Stent, which pictures the beauty as possessing</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Eyebrows shaped like leaves of willows</div>
      <div class="verse">Drooping over “autumn billows;”</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>A belle is described as having cheeks like the almond flower,
lips like a peach’s bloom, waist as the willow leaf, eyes bright
as dancing ripples in the sun, and footsteps like the lotus flower.
Much time and care is bestowed, or said to be, by females upon
their toilet, but if those in the upper classes have anything like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[771]</a></span>
the variety of domestic duties which their sisters in common life
perform, they have little leisure left for superfluous adorning.
If dramas give an index of Chinese manners and occupations,
they do not convey the idea that most of the time of well-bred
ladies is spent in idleness or dressing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOILET PRACTICES.</div>

<p>At his toilet a Chinese uses a basin of tepid water and a cloth,
and it has been aptly remarked that he never appears so dirty
as when trying to clean himself. Shaving is done by the barber,
for no man can shave the top of his head. Whiskers are never
worn, even by the very few who have them, and mustaches are
not considered proper for a man under forty. Snuff bottles and
tobacco pipes are carried and used by both sexes, but the practice
of chewing betel-nut is confined to the men, who, however,
take much pains to keep their teeth white. Among ornamental
articles of dress, in none do they go to so much expense and
style as in the snuff bottle, which is often carved from stone,
amber, agate, and other rare minerals with most exquisite taste.
Snuff is put on the thumb-nail with a spoon fastened to the
stopper&mdash;a more cleanly way than the European mode of
“pinching.”<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>The articles of food which the Chinese eat, and the mode and
ceremonies attending their feasts, have aided much, in giving
them the odd character they bear abroad, though uncouth or
unsavory viands form an infinitesimal portion of their food,
and ceremonious feasts not one in a thousand of their repasts.
Travellers have so often spoken of birdsnest soup, canine hams,
and grimalkin fricassees, rats, snakes, worms, and other culinary
novelties, served up in equally strange ways, that their readers
get the idea that these articles form as large a proportion of
the food as their description does of the narrative. In general,
the diet of the Chinese is sufficient in variety, wholesome, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">[772]</a></span>
well cooked, though many of the dishes are unpalatable to a
European from the vegetable oils used in their preparation, and
the alliaceous plants introduced to savor them. In the assortment
of dishes, Barrow has truly said that “there is a wider
difference, perhaps, between the rich and the poor of China than
in any other country. That wealth, which if permitted would
be expended in flattering the vanity of its possessors, is now
applied to the purchase of dainties to pamper the appetite.”</p>

<p>The proportion of animal food is probably smaller among the
Chinese than other nations on the same latitude, one platter of
fish or flesh, and sometimes both, being the usual allowance on
the tables of the poor. Rice, maize, Italian millet, and wheat
furnish most of the cereal food; the first is emphatically the
staff of life, and considered indispensable all over the land. Its
long use is indicated in the number of terms employed to describe
it and the variety of allusions to it in common expressions.
To <i>take a meal</i> is <i>chih fan</i>, ‘eat rice;’ and the salutation
equivalent to <i>how d’ye?</i> is <i>chih kwo fan?</i> ‘have you eaten
rice?’ The grain is deprived of its skin by wooden pestles
worked in a mortar by levers, either by a water-wheel or more
commonly by oxen or men. It is cleaned by rubbing it in an
earthen dish scored on the inside, and steamed in a shallow iron
boiler partly filled with water, over which a basket or sieve containing
the rice is supported on a framework; a wooden dish
fits over the whole and confines the steam. By this process the
kernels are thoroughly cooked without forming a pasty mass, as
is too often the result when boiled by cooks in Christian countries.
Bread, vegetables, and other articles are cooked in a
similar manner; four or five sieves, each of them full and
nicely fitting into each other, are placed upon the boiler and
covered with a cowl; in the water beneath, which supplies the
steam, meats or other things are boiled at the same time. Wheat
flour is boiled into cakes, dumplings, and other articles, but not
baked into bread. Maize, buckwheat, oats, and barley are not
ground, but the grain is cooked in various ways, alone or mixed
with other dishes. Italian millet, or canary-seed (<i>Setaria</i>), furnishes
a large amount of nutritious cereal food in the north; the
flour is yellow and sweet, and boiled or baked for eating, often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">[773]</a></span>
seasoned with jujube plums in the cakes. Its cultivation is easy,
and its prolific crop makes up in a measure for the small seeds;
ten thousand kernels have been counted on one spike in a good
season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VEGETABLES EATEN BY THE CHINESE.</div>

<p>The Chinese have a long list of culinary vegetables, and much
of their agriculture consists in rearing them. Leguminous and
cruciferous plants occupy the largest part of the kitchen garden;
more than twenty sorts of peas and beans are cultivated, some
for camels and horses, but mostly for men. <i>Soy</i> is made by boiling
the beans and mixing water, salt, and wheat, and producing
fermentation by yeast; its quality is inferior to the foreign.
Another more common condiment, called bean curd or bean jam,
is prepared by boiling and grinding black beans and mixing the
flour with water, gypsum, and turmeric. The consumption of
cabbage, broccoli, kale, cauliflower, cress, colewort, and other
cruciferous plants is enormous; a great variety of modes are
adopted for cooking, preserving, and improving them. The
leaves and stems of many plants besides those are included in
the variety of greens, and a complete enumeration of them
would form a curious list. Lettuce, sow thistle (<i>Sonchus</i>),
spinach, celery, dandelion, succory, sweet basil, ginger, mustard,
radishes, artemisia, amaranthus, tacca, pig weed (<i>Chenopodium</i>),
burslane, shepherd’s purse, clover, ailantus, and others having
no English names, all furnish green leaves for Chinese tables.
Garlics, leeks, scallions, onions, and chives are eaten by all
classes, detected upon all persons, and smelt in all rooms where
they are eating or cooking. Carrots, gourds, squashes, cucumbers,
watermelons, tomatoes, turnips, radishes, brinjals, pumpkins,
okers, etc., are among the list of garden vegetables; the
variety of cucurbitaceous plants extends to nearly twenty. Most
of these vegetables are inferior to the same articles in the markets
of western cities, where science has improved their size or
flavor. Several aquatic plants increase the list, among which
the nelumbium covers extensive marshes in the eastern and
northern provinces, otherwise unsightly and barren. The root
is two or three feet long, and pierced longitudinally with several
holes; when boiled it is of a yellowish color and sweetish taste,
not unlike a turnip. Taro is used less than the nelumbium, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[774]</a></span>
so are the water-caltrops (<i>Trapa</i>) and water-chestnuts. The taste
of water-caltrops when boiled resembles that of new cheese;
water-chestnuts are the round roots of a kind of sedge, and resemble
that fruit in color more than in taste, which is mealy and
crisp. The sweet potato is the most common tuber; although
the Irish potato has been cultivated for scores of years it has
not become a common vegetable among the people, except on
the borders of Mongolia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMMON TABLE FRUITS.</div>

<p>The catalogue of fruits comprises most of those occurring
elsewhere in the tropic and temperate zones, and China is probably
the earliest home of the peach, plum, and pear. The pears
are large and juicy, sometimes weighing eight or ten pounds;
the white and strawberry pear are equal to any western variety.
The apples are rather dry and insipid. The peaches, plums,
quinces, and apricots are better, and offer many good varieties.
Cherries are almost unknown. The orange is the common fruit
at the south, and the baskets, stalls, and piles of this golden fruit,
mixed with and heightened by contrast with other sorts and with
vegetables, which line the streets of Canton and Amoy in winter,
present a beautiful sight. Many distinct species of Citrus, as the
lemon, kumquot, pumelo, citron, and orange, are extensively cultivated.
The most delicious is the <i>chu-sha kih</i>, or ‘mandarin
orange;’ the skin, when ripe, is of a cinnabar red color, and
adheres to the pulp by a few loose fibres. The citron is more
prized for its fragrance than taste, and the thick rind is now
and then made more abundant by cutting it into strips when
growing, each of which becomes a roundish end like a finger,
whence the name of <i>Fuh shao</i>, or ‘Buddha’s hand,’ given it. It
will remain uncorrupt for two or three months, diffusing an
agreeable perfume.</p>

<p>Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI.</a> contains brief notices of other fruits. The banana
and persimmon are common, and several varieties are enumerated
of each; the plantain is eaten raw and cooked, and forms a large
item in the subsistence of the poor. The pomegranate, carambola
or tree gooseberry, mango, custard-apple, pine-apple, rose-apple,
bread-fruit, fig, guava, and olive, some of them as good
and others inferior to what are found in other countries, increase
the list. The <i>whampe</i>, <i>líchí</i>, <i>lungan</i>, or ‘dragon’s eyes,’ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">[775]</a></span>
<i>loquat</i>, are the native names of four indigenous fruits at Canton.
The whampe (<i>Cookia</i>) resembles a grape in size and a gooseberry
in taste; the loquat or <i>pebo</i> (<i>Eriobotrya</i>) is a kind of
medlar. The líchí looks like a strawberry in size and shape;
the tough, rough red skin encloses a sweet watery pulp of a
whitish color surrounding a hard seed. Grapes are plenty and
cheap; in the northern cities they are preserved during the
winter, and even till May, by constant care in regulating the
temperature.</p>

<p>Chestnuts, walnuts, ground-nuts, filberts (<i>Torreya</i>), almonds,
and the seeds of the salisburia and nelumbium, are the most
common nuts. The Chinese date (<i>Rhamnus</i>) has a sweetish,
acidulous flesh; the olive is salted or pickled; the names of
both these fruits are given them because of a resemblance to the
western sorts, for neither the proper date nor olive grows in
China. A pleasant sweetmeat, like cranberry, is made from
the seeds of the arbutus (<i>Myrica</i>), and another still more acid
from a sort of haw, both of them put up for exportation.</p>

<p>Preserved fruits are common, and the list of sweetmeats and
delicacies is increased by the addition of many roots, some of
which are preserved in syrup and others as comfits. Ginger,
nelumbium roots, bamboo shoots, the common potato, and
other vegetables are thus prepared for export as well as domestic
consumption. The natives consume enormous quantities of
pickles of an inferior quality, especially cabbages and onions,
but foreigners consider them detestable. The Chinese eat but
few spices; black pepper is used medicinally as a tea, and
cayenne pepper when the pod is green.</p>

<p>Oils and fats are in universal use for cooking; crude lard or
pork fat, castor oil, sesamum oil, and that expressed from two
species of Camellia and the ground-nut, are all employed for
domestic and culinary purposes. The Chinese use little or no
milk, butter, or cheese; the comparatively small number of
cattle raised and the consequent dearness of these articles may
have caused them to fall into disuse, for they are all common
among the Manchus and Mongols. A Chinese table seems ill
furnished to a foreigner when he sees neither bread, butter, nor
milk upon it, and if he express his disrelish of the oily dishes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[776]</a></span>
alliaceous stews before him, the Chinese thinks that he delivers a
sufficient retort to his want of taste when he answers, “You eat
cheese, and sometimes when it can almost walk.” Milk is used
a little, and no one who has lived in Canton can forget the prolonged
mournful cry of <i>ngao nai!</i> of the men hawking it about
the streets late at night. Women’s milk is sold for the sustenance
of infants and superannuated people, the idea being prevalent
that it is peculiarly nourishing to aged persons.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>Sugar is grown only in Formosa and the three southern provinces,
which supply the others; neither molasses nor rum are
manufactured from it. No sugar is expressed from sorghum
stalks, nor do the Chinese know that it contains syrup. The
tobacco is milder than the American plant; it is smoked and
not chewed or made into cigars, though these are being imported
from Manila in steadily increasing quantities, and find favor
among many of the wealthier Chinese; snuff is largely used.
The betel-nut is a common masticatory, made up of a slice of
the nut and the fresh leaf of the betel-pepper with a little lime
rubbed on it. The common beverages are tea and arrack, both
of which are taken warm; cold water is not often drunk, cold
liquids of any kind being considered unwholesome. The constant
practice of boiling water before drinking, in preparing tea,
doubtless tends to make it less noxious, when the people are not
particular as to its sources. Coffee, chocolate, and cocoa are unknown,
as are also beer, cider, porter, wine, and brandy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KINDS OF ANIMAL FOOD USED.</div>

<p>The meats consumed by the Chinese comprise, perhaps, a
greater variety than are used in other countries; while, at the
same time, very little land is appropriated to rearing animals
for food. Beef is not a common meat, chiefly from a Buddhistic
prejudice against killing so useful an animal. Mutton in
the southern provinces is poor and dear compared with its ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">[777]</a></span>cellence
and cheapness north of the Yangtsz’ River, where the
greater numbers of Mohammedans cause a larger demand for
it. The beef of the buffalo and the mutton of the goat are still
less used; pork is consumed more than all other kinds, and no
meat can be raised so economically. Hardly a family so poor
that it cannot possess a pig; the animals are kept even on the
boats and rafts, to consume and fatten upon what others leave.
Fresh pork probably constitutes more than half of the meat
eaten by the Chinese; hams are tolerably plenty, and a dish
called “golden hams,” from the amber appearance of the joint,
makes a conspicuous object in feasts. Horseflesh, venison, wild
boar, and antelope are now and then seen, but in passing through
the markets mutton, pork, fowls, and fish are the viands which
everywhere meet the eye.</p>

<p>A few kittens and puppies are sold alive in cages, mewing
and yelping as if in anticipation of their fate, or from pain
caused by the pinching and handling they receive at the hands
of dissatisfied customers. Those intended for the table are
usually fed upon rice, so that if the nature of their food be
considered, their flesh is far more cleanly than that of the omnivorous
hog; few articles of food have, however, been so identified
abroad with the tastes of the people as kittens, puppies,
and rats have with the Chinese. American school geographies
often contain pictures of a market-man carrying baskets holding
these unfortunate victims of a perverse taste (as we think), or
else a string of rats and mice hanging by their tails to a stick
across his shoulders, which almost necessarily convey the idea
that such things form the usual food of the people. Travellers
hear beforehand that the Chinese devour everything, and when
they arrive in the country straightway inquire if these animals
are eaten, and hearing that such is the case, perpetuate the idea
that they form the common articles of food. However commonly
live kittens and puppies or dressed dogs may be exposed
for sale, one may live in a city like Canton or Fuhchau for
many years and never see rats offered for food, unless he hunts
up the people who sell them for medicine or aphrodisiacs; in
fact, they are not so easily caught as to be either common or
cheap. A peculiar prejudice in favor of black dogs and cats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[778]</a></span>
exists among natives of the south; these animals invariably
command a higher price than others, and are eaten at midsummer
in the belief that the meat ensures health and strength during
the ensuing year.</p>

<p>Rats and mice are, no doubt, eaten now and then, and so are
many other undesirable things, by those whom want compels to
take what they can get; but to put these and other strange eatables
in the front of the list gives a distorted idea of the everyday
food of the people. There are perhaps half a dozen restaurants
in Canton city where dog’s-meat appears upon the
<i>menu</i>; it is, however, by no means an inexpensive delicacy.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
The flesh of rats is eaten by old women as a hair restorative.</p>

<p>The blood of ducks, pigs, and sheep is used as food, or prepared
for medicine and as a paste; it forms an ingredient in
priming and some kind of varnish. It is coagulated into cakes
for sale, and in cooking is mixed with the meats and sauces.
The blood of all animals is eaten without repugnance so far as
concerns religious scruples, except in the case of Buddhist
priests.</p>

<p>Frogs are caught in a curious manner by tying a young
jumper lately emerged from tadpole life to a line and bobbing
him up and down in the grass and grain of a rice field, where
the old croakers are wont to harbor. As soon as one of them
sees the young frog sprawling and squirming he makes a
plunge at him and swallows him whole, whereupon he is immediately
conveyed to the frog-fisher’s basket, losing his life, liberty,
and lunch together, for the bait is rescued from his maw
and used again as long as life lasts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HATCHING DUCKS’ EGGS.</div>

<p>Poultry, including chickens, geese, and ducks, are everywhere
raised; of the three the geese are the best flavored, but all of
them are reared cheaply and supply a large portion of the poor
with the principal meat they eat. The eggs of fowls and ducks
are hatched artificially, and every visitor to Canton remembers
the duck-boats in which those birds are hatched and reared
and carried up and down the river seeking for pasture along
its muddy banks. Sheds are erected for hatching, in which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">[779]</a></span>
a number of high baskets well lined to retain the heat. Each
one is placed over a fireplace, so that the heat shall be conveyed
to the eggs through the tile in its bottom and retained
in the basket by a close cover. When the eggs are brought a
layer is put into the bottom of each basket, and a fire kept in
the room at a uniform heat of about 80° F. After four or five
days they are examined in a strong light, to separate the addled
ones; the others are put back in the baskets and the heat kept
up for ten days longer, when they are all placed upon shelves in
the centre of the shed and covered with cotton and felt for
fourteen days. At the end of the twenty-eighth day the shells
are broken to release the inmates, which are sold to those who
rear them. Pigeons are raised to a great extent; their eggs
form an ingredient in soups. Wild and water fowl are caught in
nets or shot; the wild duck, teal, grebe, wild goose, plover, snipe,
heron, egret, partridge, pheasant, and ortolan or rice bird are all
procurable at Canton, and the list could be increased elsewhere.</p>

<p>If the Chinese eat many things which are rejected by other
peoples, they are perfectly omnivorous with respect to aquatic
productions; here nothing comes amiss; all waters are vexed
with their fisheries. Their nets and other contrivances for
capturing fish display great ingenuity, and most of them are
admirably adapted to the purpose. Rivers, creeks, and stagnant
pools, the great ocean and the little tank, mountain lakes and
garden ponds, tubs and rice fields, all furnish their quota to the
sustenance of man, and tend to explain, in a great degree, the
dense population. The right to fish in running streams and
natural waters is open to all, while artificial reservoirs, as ponds,
pools, tanks, tubs, etc., are brought into available use; near tide-water
the rice grounds are turned into fish-ponds in winter if
they will thereby afford a more profitable return. The inhabitants
of the water are killed with the spear, caught with the
hook, scraped up by the dredge, ensnared by traps, and captured
by nets; they are decoyed to jump into boats by painted boards,
and frightened into nets by noisy ones, taken out of the water
by lifting nets and dived for by birds&mdash;for the cormorant seizes
what his owner could not easily reach. In short, every possible
way of catching or rearing fish is practised in one part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">[780]</a></span>
country or another. Tanks are placed in the streets, with water
running through them, where carp or perch are reared until they
become so large they can hardly turn round in their pens; eels
and water-snakes of every color and size are fed in tubs and jars
until customers carry them off.</p>

<p>King-crabs, cuttle-fish, sharks, sting-rays, gobies, tortoises,
turtles, crabs, prawns, crawfish, and shrimps add to the variety.
The best fish in the Canton market are the garoupa or rock cod,
pomfret, sole, mackerel, bynni carp or mango fish, and the polynemus,
erroneously called salmon. Carp and tench of many
kinds, herring, shad, perch, mullet, and bream, with others less
common at the west, are found in great abundance. They are
usually eaten fresh, or merely opened and dried in the sun, as
stock-fish. Both salt and fresh-water shell-fish are abundant.
The oysters are not so well flavored as those on the Atlantic coast
of America; the crabs and prawns are excellent, but the clams,
mussels, and other fresh-water species are less palatable. Insect
food is confined to locusts and grasshoppers, grubs and silk-worms;
the latter are fried to a crisp when cooked. These and water-snakes
are decidedly the most repulsive things the Chinese eat.</p>

<p>Many articles of food are sought after by this sensual people
for their supposed aphrodisiac qualities, and most of the singular
productions brought from abroad for food are of this nature.
The famous birdsnest soup is prepared from the nest of a swallow
(<i>Collocalia esculenta</i>) found in caves and damp places in
some islands of the Indian Archipelago; the bird macerates the
material of the nest from seaweed (<i>Gelidium</i> chiefly) in the
crop, and constructs it by drawing the food out in fibres, which
are attached to the damp stone with the bill. The nest has the
same shape as those which chimney swallows build, and holds
the young against the cliffs; they rarely exceed three or four
inches in the longest diameter. The operation of cleaning is
performed by picking away each morsel of dirt or feathers
from the nest, and involves considerable labor. After they come
forth perfectly free from impurities they are stewed with pigeons’
eggs, spicery, and other ingredients into a soup; when cooked
they resemble isinglass, and the dish depends upon sauces and
seasoning for most of its taste. The biche-de-mer, tripang, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">[781]</a></span>
sea-slug, is a marine substance procured from the Polynesian
Islands; it is sought after under the same idea of its invigorating
qualities, and being cheaper than the birdsnest is a more common
dish; when cooked it resembles pork-rind in appearance and
taste. Sharks’ fins and fish-maws are imported and boiled into
gelatinous soups that are nourishing and palatable; and the
sinews, tongues, palates, udders, and other parts of different
animals are sought after as delicacies. A large proportion of
the numerous made dishes seen at great feasts consists of such
odd articles, most of which are supposed to possess some peculiar
strengthening quality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COOKING AMONG THE CHINESE.</div>

<p>The art of cooking has not reached any high degree of perfection.
Like the French, it is very economical, and consists of
stews and fried dishes more than of baked or roasted. Salt is
proportionately dear from its preparation being a government
monopoly, and this has led to a large use of onions for seasoning.
The articles of kitchen furniture are few and simple; an iron
boiler, shaped like the segment of a sphere, for stewing or frying,
a portable earthen furnace, and two or three different shaped
earthenware pots for boiling water or vegetables constitute the
whole establishment of thousands of families. A few other
utensils, as tongs, ladles, forks, sieves, mills, etc., are used to a
greater or less extent, though the variety is quite commensurate
with the simple cookery. Both meats and vegetables, previously
hashed into mouthfuls, are stewed or fried in oil or fat; they
are not cooked in large joints or steaks for the table of a household.
Hogs are baked whole for sacrifices and for sale in cook-shops,
but before being eaten are hashed and fried again. Cutting
the food into small pieces secures its thorough cooking with less
fuel than it would otherwise require, and is moreover indispensable
for eating with chopsticks. Two or three vegetables are
boiled together, but meat soups are seldom seen; and the immense
variety of puddings, pastry, cakes, pies, custards, ragouts,
creams, etc., made in western lands is almost unknown in China.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">SOCIAL LIFE AMONG THE CHINESE.</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">FACTORS IN CHINESE SOCIAL LIFE.</div>

<p>The preceding chapter, in a measure, exhibits the attainments
the Chinese have reached in the comforts and elegances of living.
These terms, as tests of civilization, however, are so comparative
that it is rather difficult to define them; for the notions
which an Englishman, an Egyptian, and a Chinese severally
might have of comfort and elegance in the furniture and arrangement
of their houses are almost as unlike as their languages.
If Fisher’s <cite>Views of China</cite> be taken as a guide, one
can easily believe that the Chinese need little from abroad to
better their condition in these particulars; while if one listen to
the descriptions of some persons who have resided among them,
it will be concluded that they possess neither comfort in their
houses, civility in their manners, nor cleanliness in their persons.
In passing to an account of their social life, this variety
of tastes should not be overlooked; and if some points appear
objectionable when taken alone, a little further examination
will, perhaps, show that they form part of a system which requires
complete reconstruction before it could be happily and
safely altered.</p>

<p>The observations of a foreigner upon Chinese society are
likely to be modified by his own feelings, and the way in which
he has been treated by natives there; but their behavior to him
might be very unlike what would be deemed good breeding
among themselves. If a Chinese feared or expected something
from a foreigner, he would act toward him more politely than
if the contrary were the case; on the one hand better, on the
other worse, than he would toward one of his own countrymen
in like circumstances. In doing so, it may be remarked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">[783]</a></span>
regret that he would only imitate the conduct of a host of
foreigners who visit China, and whose coarse remarks, rude
actions, and general supercilious conduct toward the natives ill
comport with their superior civilization and assumed advantages.
One who looked at the matter reasonably would not expect
much true politeness among a people whose conceit and ignorance,
selfishness and hauteur, were nearly equal; nor be surprised
to find the intercourse between the extremes of society
present a strange mixture of brutality and commiseration, formality
and disdain. The separation of the sexes modifies and
debases the amusements, even of the most moral, leads the men
to spend their time in gambling, devote it to the pleasures of
the table, or dawdle it away when the demands of business,
study, or labor do not arouse them. Political parties, which
exert so powerful an influence upon the conduct of men in
Christian countries, leading them to unite and communicate
with each other for the purpose of watching or resisting the
acts of government, do not exist; and where there is a general
want of confidence, such institutions as insurance companies,
savings or deposit banks, corporate bodies to build a railroad
or factory, and associations of any kind in which persons unite
their funds and efforts to accomplish an object, are not to be
expected; they do not exist in China, nor did they in Rome or
ancient Europe. Nor will any one expect to hear that literary
societies or voluntary philanthropic associations are common.
These, as they are now found in the west, are the products of
Christianity alone, and we must wait for the planting of the tree
before looking for its fruit. The legal profession, as distinct
from the possession of office, is not an occupation in which
learned men can obtain an honorable livelihood; the priesthood
is confined to monasteries and temples, and its members do not
enter into society; while the practice of medicine is so entirely
empirical and strange that the few experienced practitioners are
not enough to redeem the class. These three professions, which
elsewhere do so much to elevate society and guide public
opinion, being wanting, educated men have no stimulus to draw
them out into independent action. The competition for literary
degrees and official rank, the eager pursuit of trade, or the dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[784]</a></span>
routine of mechanical and agricultural labor, form the leading
avocations of the Chinese people. Unacquainted with the intellectual
enjoyments found in books and the conversation of
learned men, and having no educated taste, as we understand
that term (while, too, he cannot find such a thing as virtuous
female society), the Chinese resorts to the dice-box, the opium-pipe,
or the brothel for his pleasures, though even there with
a loss of character among his peers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESULTS UPON SOCIETY OF SEPARATING THE SEXES.</div>

<p>The separation of the sexes has many bad results, only partially
compensated by some conservative ones. Woman owes
her present elevation at the west to Christianity, not only in
the degree of respect, support, freedom from servile labor, and
education which she receives, but also in the reflex influences
she exerts of a purifying, harmonizing, and elevating character.
Where the requirements of the Gospel exert no force, her
rights are more or less disregarded, and if she become as debased
as the men, she can exert little good influence even upon
her own family, still less upon the community. General mixed
society can never be maintained with pleasure unless the better
parts of human nature have the acknowledged preëminence,
and where she, who imparts to it all its gracefulness and purity,
is herself uneducated, unpolished, and immodest, the common
sense of mankind sees its impropriety. By advocating the
partition of the sexes, legislators and moralists in China have
acted as they best could in the circumstances of the case, and
by preventing the evils beyond their remedy, provided the best
safeguards they could against general corruption. In her own
domestic circle a Chinese female, in the character and duties of
daughter, wife, or mother, finds as much employment, and probably
as many enjoyments, as the nature of her training has fitted
her for. She does not hold her proper place in society simply
because she has never been taught its duties or exercised its
privileges.</p>

<p>In ordinary cases the male and female branches of a household
are strictly kept apart; not only the servants, but even
brothers and sisters do not freely associate after the boys commence
their studies. At this period of life, or even earlier, an
anxious task devolves upon parents, which is to find suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">[785]</a></span>
partners for their children. Betrothment is entirely in their
hands, and is conducted through the medium of a class of persons
called <i>mei-jin</i>, or go-betweens, who are expected to be well
acquainted with the character and circumstances of the parties.
Mothers sometimes contract their unborn progeny on the sole
contingency of a difference of sex, but the usual age of forming
these engagements is ten, twelve, or older, experience having
shown that the casualties attending it render an earlier period
undesirable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BETROTHMENT AND PRELIMINARIES OF MARRIAGE.</div>

<p>There are six ceremonies which constitute a regular marriage,
though their details vary much in different parts of the
Empire: 1. The father and elder brother of the young man
send a go-between to the father and brother of the girl, to inquire
her name and the moment of her birth, that the horoscope
of the two may be examined, in order to ascertain whether the
proposed alliance will be a happy one. 2. If the eight characters<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
seem to augur aright, the boy’s friends send the <i>mei-jin</i>
back to make an offer of marriage. 3. If that be accepted, the
second party is again requested to return an assent in writing.
4. Presents are then sent to the girl’s parents according to the
means of the parties. 5. The go-between requests them to
choose a lucky day for the wedding. 6. The preliminaries
are concluded by the bridegroom going or sending a party of
friends with music to bring his bride to his own house. The
match-makers contrive to multiply their visits and prolong the
negotiations, when the parties are rich, to serve their own
ends.</p>

<p>In Fuhkien parents often send pledges to each other when
their children are mere infants, and registers containing their
names and particulars of nativity are exchanged in testimony of
the contract. After this has been done it is impossible to retract
the engagement, unless one of the parties becomes a leper or is
disabled. When the children are espoused older, the boy sometimes
accompanies the go-between and the party carrying the
presents to the house of his future mother-in-law, and receives
from her some trifling articles, as melon-seeds, fruits, etc., which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">[786]</a></span>
he distributes to those around. Among the presents sent to the
girl are fruits, money, vermicelli, and a ham, of which she gives
a morsel to each one of the party, and sends its foot back. These
articles are neatly arranged, and the party bringing them is received
with a salute of fire-crackers.</p>

<p>From the time of engagement until marriage a young lady is
required to maintain the strictest seclusion. Whenever friends
call upon her parents she is expected to retire to the inner apartments,
and in all her actions and words guard her conduct with
careful solicitude. She must use a close sedan whenever she
visits her relations, and in her intercourse with her brothers and
the domestics in the household maintain great reserve. Instead
of having any opportunity to form those friendships and acquaintances
with her own sex which among ourselves become
a source of so much pleasure at the time and advantage in after
life, the Chinese maiden is confined to the circle of her relations
and her immediate neighbors. She has few of the pleasing remembrances
and associations that are usually connected with
school-day life, nor has she often the ability or opportunity to
correspond by letter with girls of her own age. Seclusion at this
time of life, and the custom of crippling the feet, combine to
confine women in the house almost as much as the strictest laws
against their appearing abroad; for in girlhood, as they know
only a few persons except relatives, and can make very few acquaintances
after marriage, their circle of friends contracts rather
than enlarges as life goes on. This privacy impels girls to learn
as much of the world as they can, and among the rich their
curiosity is gratified through maid-servants, match-makers, pedlers,
visitors, and others. Curiosity also stimulates young ladies
to learn something of the character and appearance of their intended
husbands, but the rules of society are too strict for young
persons to endeavor to form a personal attachment, though it is
not impossible for them to see each other if they wish, and there
are, no doubt, many contracts suggested to parents by their
children.</p>

<p>The office of match-maker is considered honorable, and both
men and women are employed to conduct nuptial negotiations.
Great confidence is reposed in their judgment and veracity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">[787]</a></span>
as their employment depends somewhat upon their tact and
character, they have every inducement to act with strict propriety
in their intercourse with families. The father of the girl
employs their services in collecting the sum agreed upon in the
contract, which, in ordinary circumstances, varies from twenty-five
to forty dollars, increasing to a hundred and over according
to the condition of the bridegroom; until that is paid the marriage
does not take place. The presents sent at betrothment are
sometimes costly, consisting of silks, rice, cloths, fruits, etc.; the
bride brings no dower, but both parents frequently go to expenses
they can ill afford when celebrating the nuptials of their
children, as the pride of family stimulates each party to make
undue display.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARRIAGE CEREMONIES AND CUSTOMS.</div>

<p>The principal formalities of a marriage are everywhere the
same, but local customs are observed in some regions which are
quite unknown and appear singular elsewhere. In Fuhkien,
when the lucky day for the wedding comes, the guests assemble
in the bridegroom’s house to celebrate it, where also sedans, a
band of music, and porters are in readiness. The courier, who
acts as guide to the chair-bearers, takes the lead, and in order to
prevent the onset of malicious demons lurking by the road, a
baked hog or large piece of pork is carried in front, that the
procession may safely pass while these hungry souls are devouring
the meat. Meanwhile the bride arrays herself in her best
dress and richest jewels. Her girlish tresses have already been
bound up, and her hair arranged by a matron, with due formality;
an ornamental and complicated head-dress made of rich
materials, not unlike a helmet or corona, often forms part of her
coiffure. Her person is nearly covered by a large mantle, over
which is an enormous hat like an umbrella, that descends to the
shoulders and shades the whole figure. Thus attired she takes
her seat in the red gilt marriage sedan, called <i>hwa kiao</i>, borne
by four men, in which she is completely concealed. This is
locked by her mother or some other relative, and the key given
to one of the bridemen, who hands it to the bridegroom or his
representative on reaching his house.</p>

<p>The procession is now rearranged, with the addition of as
many red boxes and trays to contain the wardrobe, kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">[788]</a></span>
utensils, and the feast, as the means of the family or the extent
of her paraphernalia require. As the procession approaches the
bridegroom’s house the courier hastens forward to announce its
coming, whereupon the music strikes up, and fire-crackers salute
her until she enters the gate. As she approaches the door the
bridegroom conceals himself, but the go-between brings forward
a young child to salute her, while going to seek the closeted
bridegroom. He approaches with becoming gravity and opens
the sedan to hand out his bride, she still retaining the hat and
mantle; they approach the ancestral tablet, which they reverence
with three bows, and then seat themselves at a table upon
which are two cups of spirits. The go-between serves them,
though the bride can only make the motions of drinking, as the
large hat completely covers her face. They soon retire into a
chamber, where the husband takes the hat and mantle from his
wife, and sees her, perhaps, for the first time in his life. After he
has considered her for some time, the guests and friends enter
the room to survey her, when each one is allowed to express an
opinion; the criticisms of the women are severest, perhaps because
they remember the time they stood in her unpleasant
position. This cruel examination being over, she is introduced
to her husband’s parents, and then salutes her own. Such are
some of the customs among the Fuhkienese. Other usages followed
in marriages and betrothals have been carefully described
by Doolittle, with particular reference to the same people, and
by Archdeacon John H. Gray, alluding to other parts of the
Empire.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>The bridegroom, previous to the wedding, receives a new
name or “style,” and is formally capped by his father in presence
of his friends, as an introduction to manhood. He invites
the guests, sending two red cakes with each invitation, and to
him each guest, a few days before the marriage, returns a
present or a sum of money worth about ten or fifteen cents,
nominally equal to the expenses he will be considered as occasioning.
Another invitation is sent the day after to a feast, and
the bride also calls on the ladies who attended her wedding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[789]</a></span>
from whom she receives a ring or some other article of small
value. The gentlemen also make the bridegroom a present of
a pair of lanterns to hang at his gateway. On the night of the
wedding they sometimes endeavor to get into the house when
the pair is supposed to be asleep, in order to carry off some
article, which the bridegroom must ransom at their price.</p>

<p>Among the poor the expenses of a wedding are much lessened
by purchasing a young girl, whom the parents bring up as a
daughter until she is marriageable, and in this way secure her
services in the household. A girl already affianced is for a like
reason sometimes sent to the boy’s parents, that they may support
her. In small villages the people call upon a newly married
couple near the next full moon, when they are received
standing near the bedside. The men enter first and pay their
respects to the bride, while her husband calls the attention of
his visitors to her charms, praises her little feet, her beautiful
hands, and other features, and then accompanies them into the
hall, where they are regaled with refreshments. After the
men have retired the women enter and make their remarks
upon the lady, whose future character depends a good deal upon
the manner in which she conducts herself. If she shows good
temper, her reputation is made. Many a prudent woman on
this occasion says not a word, but suffers herself to be examined
in silence in order that she may run no risk of offending.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Far
different is this introduction to married life from the bridal
tour and cordial greetings of friends which ladies receive in
western lands during the honeymoon!</p>

<div class="sidenote">NUPTIAL PROCESSION AND FESTIVITIES.</div>

<p>The bridal procession is a peculiar feature of Chinese social
life. It varies in its style, nature of the ornaments, and the
whole get-up in all parts of the land, but is always as showy as
the means of the parties will allow. It is composed of bearers
of lanterns and official tablets, musicians, relatives of the bride
and groom and their personal friends, framed stands with roofs
carried on thills to hold the bride’s effects, all centering around
her sedan. In Peking such a procession will sometimes be
stretched out half a mile, and the sedan borne by a dozen or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">[790]</a></span>
more bearers. The coolies are dressed in red, and they and
their burdens are usually provided by special shopmen, who
purvey on such occasions. The tablets of literary rank held by
members of the family, wooden dragons’ heads, titular lanterns,
and other official insignia are borne in state, an evidence of its
high standing. In some places an old man, elegantly dressed,
heads the procession, bearing a large umbrella to hold over the
bride when she enters and leaves her sedan; behind him come
bearers with lanterns, one of which carries the inscription, “The
phœnixes sing harmoniously.” To these succeed the music and
the honorary tablets, titular flags, state umbrella, etc., and two
stout men as executioners dressed in a fantastic manner, wearing
long feathers in their caps, and lictors, chain-bearers, and other
emblems of office. Parties of young lads, prettily dressed
and playing on drums, gongs, and flutes, or carrying lanterns
and banners, occasionally form a pleasing variety in the train,
which is continued by the trays and covered tables containing
the bride’s trousseau, and ended with the sedan containing
herself.</p>

<p>The ceremonies attending her reception at her husband’s
house are not uniform. In some parts she is lifted out of the
sedan, over a pan of charcoal placed in the court, and carried
into the bed-chamber; in other places she enters and leaves her
sedan on rugs spread for her use, and walks into the chamber.
After a brief interval she returns into the hall, bearing a tray
of betel-nut for the guests, and then worships a pair of geese
brought in the train with her husband, this bird being an emblem
of conjugal affection. On returning to her chamber the
bridegroom follows her and takes off the red veil, after which
they pledge each other in wine, the cups being joined by a
thread. While there a matron who has borne several children
to one husband comes in to pronounce a blessing upon them
and make up the nuptial bed. The assembled guests then sit
down to the feast and ply the <i>sin lang</i>, ‘new man’ or bridegroom,
pretty well with liquor; the Chinese on such occasions
do not, however, often overpass the rules of sobriety. The <i>sin
fujin</i>, ‘new lady’ or bride, and her mother-in-law also attend
to those of her own sex who are present in other apartments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">[791]</a></span>
but among the poor a pleasanter sight is now and then seen in
all the guests sitting at one table.</p>

<p>In the morning the pair worship the ancestral tablets and
salute all the members of the family; among the poor this important
ceremony occurs very soon after the pair have exchanged
their wine-cups. The pledging of the bride and groom in a cup
of wine, and their worship of the ancestral tablets and of heaven
and earth, are the important ceremonies of a wedding after the
procession has reached the house. Marriages are celebrated at
all hours, though twilight and evening are preferred; the spring
season, or the last month in the year, are regarded as the most
felicitous nuptial periods. From the way in which the whole
matter is conducted there is some room for deception by sending
another person in the sedan than the one betrothed, or the
man may mistake the name of the girl he wishes to marry.
Mr. Smith mentions one of his acquaintances, who, having been
captivated with a girl he saw in the street, sent a go-between
with proposals to her parents, which were accepted; but he was
deeply mortified on receiving his bride to find that he had mistaken
the number of his charmer, and had received the fifth
daughter instead of the fourth.</p>

<p>The Chinese do not marry another woman with these observances
while the first one is living, but they may bring home
concubines with no other formality than a contract with her
parents, though it is considered somewhat discreditable for a
man to take another bedfellow if his wife have borne him sons,
unless he can afford each of them a separate establishment. It is
not unfrequent for a man to secure a maid-servant in the family
with the consent of his wife by purchasing her for a concubine,
especially if his occupation frequently call him away from home,
in which case he takes her as his travelling companion and leaves
his wife in charge of the household. The fact that the sons of a
concubine are considered as legally belonging to the wife induces
parents to betroth their daughters early, and thus prevent their
entering a man’s family in this inferior capacity. The Chinese
are sensible of the evils of a divided household, and the laws
place its control in the hands of the wife. If she have no sons
of her own, she looks out for a likely boy among her clansmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">[792]</a></span>
to adopt, knowing that otherwise her husband will probably
bring a concubine into the family. It is difficult even to guess
at the extent of polygamy, for no statistics have been or can be
easily taken. Among the laboring classes it is rare to find more
than one woman to one man, but tradesmen, official persons,
landholders, and those in easy circumstances frequently take
one or more concubines; perhaps two-fifths of such families
have them. Show and fashion lead some to increase the number
of their women, though aware of the discord likely to arise,
for they fully believe their own proverb, that “nine women out
of ten are jealous.” Yet it is probably true that polygamy finds
its greatest support from the women themselves. The wife seeks
to increase her own position by getting more women into the
house to relieve her own work and humor her fancies. The
Chinese illustrate the relation by comparing the wife to the
moon and the concubines to the stars, both of which in their
appropriate spheres wait upon and revolve around the sun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAWS REGULATING MARRIAGES.</div>

<p>If regard be had to the civilization of the Chinese and their
opportunities for moral training, the legal provisions of the code
to protect females in their acknowledged rights and punish
crimes against the peace and purity of the family relation reflect
credit upon their legislators. In these laws the obligation of
children to fulfil the contract made by their parents is enforced,
even to the annulling of an agreement made by a son himself
in ignorance of the arrangements of his parents. The position
of the <i>tsí</i>, or wife taken by the prescribed formalities, and that
of the <i>tsieh</i>, or women purchased as concubines, are accurately
defined, and the degradation of the former or elevation of
the latter so as to interchange their places, or the taking of a
second <i>tsí</i>, are all illegal and void. The relation between the
two is more like that which existed between Sarah and Hagar in
Abraham’s household, or Zilpah and Bilhah and their mistresses
in Jacob’s, than that indicated by our terms first and second
wife, of which idea the Chinese words contain no trace. The
degrees of unlawful marriages are comprehensive, extending even
to the prohibition of persons having the same <i>sing</i>, or family
name, and to two brothers marrying sisters. The laws forbid
the marriage of a brother’s widow, of a father’s or grandfather’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">[793]</a></span>
wife, or a father’s sister, under the penalty of death; and the
like punishment is inflicted upon whoever seizes the wife or
daughter of a freeman and carries them away to marry them.</p>

<p>These regulations not only put honor upon marriage, but
render it more common among the Chinese than almost any
other people, thereby preventing a vast train of evils. The
tendency of unrestrained desire to throw down the barriers to
the gratification of lust must not be lost sight of; and as no
laws on this subject can be effectual unless the common sense
of a people approve of them, the Chinese, by separating the
sexes in general society, have removed a principal provocation
to sin, and by compelling young men to fulfil the marriage
contracts of their parents have also provided a safeguard against
debauchery at the age when youth is most tempted to indulge,
and when indulgence would most strongly disincline them to
marry at all. They have, moreover, provided for the undoubted
succession of the inheritance by disallowing more than one <i>wife</i>,
and yet have granted men the liberty they would otherwise take,
and which immemorial usage in Asiatic countries has sanctioned.
They have done as well as they could in regulating a difficult
matter, and better, on the whole, perhaps, than in most other
unchristianized countries. If any one supposes, however, that
because these laws exist sins against the seventh commandment
are uncommon in China, he will be as mistaken as those who
infer that because the Chinese are pagans nothing like modesty,
purity, or affection exists between the sexes.</p>

<p>When a girl “spills the tea”&mdash;that is, loses her betrothed by
death&mdash;public opinion honors her if she refuse a second engagement;
and instances are cited of young ladies committing suicide
rather than contract a second marriage. They sometimes leave
their father’s house and live with the parents of their affianced
husband as if they had been really widows. It is considered
derogatory for widows to marry; though it may be that the
instances quoted in books with so much praise only indicate how
rare the practice is in reality. The widow is occasionally sold
for a concubine by her father-in-law, and the grief and contumely
of her degradation is enhanced by separation from her children,
whom she can no longer retain. Such cases are, however, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">[794]</a></span>
common, for the impulses of maternal affection are too strong
to be thus trifled with, and widows usually look to their friends
for support, or to their own exertions if their children be still
young; they are assisted, too, by their relatives in this laudable
industry and care. It is a lasting stigma to a son to neglect the
comfort and support of his widowed mother. A widower is not
restrained by any laws, and weds one of his concubines or whomsoever
he chooses; nor is he expected to defer the nuptials for
any period of mourning for his first wife.</p>

<p>The seven legal reasons for divorce, viz., barrenness, lasciviousness,
jealousy, talkativeness, thievery, disobedience to her
husband’s parents, or leprosy, are almost nullified by the single
provision that a woman cannot be put away whose parents are
not living to receive her back again. Parties can separate on
mutual disagreement, but the code does not regulate the alimony;
and a husband is liable to punishment if he retain a
wife convicted of adultery. If a wife merely elopes she can
be sold by her husband, but if she marry while absent she is
to be strangled; if the husband be absent three years a woman
must state her case to the magistrates before presuming to re-marry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRIVILEGES AND POSITION OF WIVES AND WIDOWS.</div>

<p>In regard to the general condition of females in China the
remark of De Guignes is applicable, that “though their lot is
less happy than that of their sisters in Europe, their ignorance
of a better state renders their present or prospective one more
supportable; happiness does not always consist in absolute
enjoyment, but in the idea which we have formed of it.”<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> She
does not feel that any injustice is done her by depriving her of
the right of assent as to whom her partner shall be; her wishes
and her knowledge go no farther than her domestic circle, and
where she has been trained in her mother’s apartments to the
various duties and accomplishments of her sex, her removal to
a husband’s house brings to her no great change.</p>

<p>This, however, is not always the case, and the power accorded
to the husband over his wife and family is often used with great
tyranny. The young wife finds in her new home little of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">[795]</a></span>
sympathy and love her sisters in Christian lands receive. Her
mother-in-law is not unfrequently the source of her greatest
trials, and demands from her both the submission of a child and
the labor of a slave, which is not seldom returned by disobedience
and bitter revilings. If the husband interfere she has less
likelihood of escaping his exactions; though in the lower walks
of life his cruelty is restrained by fear of losing her and her
services, and in the upper diverted by indifference as to what
she does, in the pursuit of other objects. If the wife behave
well till she herself becomes a mother and a mother-in-law, then
the tables are turned; from being a menial she becomes almost
a goddess. Luhchau, a writer on female culture, mentions the
following indirect mode of reproving a mother-in-law: “Loh
Yang travelled seven years to improve himself, during which
time his wife diligently served her mother-in-law and supported
her son at school. The poultry from a neighbor’s house once
wandered into her garden, and her mother-in-law stole and killed
them for eating. When she sat down to table and saw the
fowls she would not dine, but burst into tears, at which the old
lady was much surprised and asked the reason. ‘I am much
distressed that I am so poor and cannot afford to supply you
with all I wish I could, and that I should have caused you to
eat flesh belonging to another.’ Her parent was affected by
this, and threw away the dish.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNHAPPY BETROTHMENTS.</div>

<p>The evils attending early betrothment induce many parents
to defer engaging their daughters until they are grown, and a
husband of similar tastes can be found; for even if the condition
of the families in the interval of betrothment and marriage
unsuitably change, or the lad grows up to be a dissipated, worthless,
or cruel man, totally unworthy of the girl, still the contract
must be fulfilled, and the worst party generally is most anxious
for it. The unhappy bride in such cases often escapes from her
present sufferings and dismal prospects by suicide. A case occurred
in Canton in 1833 where a young wife, visiting her parents
shortly after marriage, so feelingly described her sufferings at
the hands of a cruel husband to her sisters and friends that she
and three of her auditors joined their hands together and drowned
themselves in a pond, she to escape present misery and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">[796]</a></span>
to avoid its future possibility. Another young lady, having
heard of the worthless character of her intended, carried a bag
of money with her in the sedan, and when they retired after
the ceremonies were over thus addressed him: “Touch me
not; I am resolved to abandon the world and become a nun.
I shall this night cut off my hair. I have saved $200, which I
give you; with the half you can purchase a concubine, and
with the rest enter on some trade. Be not lazy and thriftless.
Hereafter, remember me.” Saying this, she cut off her hair,
and her husband and his kindred, fearing suicide if they opposed
her, acquiesced, and she returned to her father’s house.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
Such cases are common enough to show the dark side of
family life, and young ladies implore their parents to rescue
them in this or some other way from the sad fate which
awaits them. Sometimes girls become skilled in female accomplishments
to recommend themselves to their husbands, and
their disappointment is the greater when they find him to be
a brutal, depraved tyrant. A melancholy instance of this occurred
in Canton in 1840, which ended in the wife committing
suicide. Her brother had been a scholar of one of the American
missionaries, and took a commendable pride in showing
specimens of his sister’s exquisite embroidery, and not
a few of her attainments in writing, which indicated their reciprocal
attachment. The contrary happens too, sometimes,
where the husband finds himself compelled to wed a woman
totally unable to appreciate or share his pursuits, but he has
means of alleviating or avoiding such misalliances which
the weaker vessel has not. On the whole, as we have said,
one must admit that woman holds a fairly high position
in China. If she suffers from the brutality of her husband,
the tyranny of her mother-in-law, or the overwork of
household, field, or loom, she is as often herself blameworthy
for indolence, shiftlessness, gadding, and bad temper. The instances
which are given by Gray<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> in his account of marital
atrocities prove the length to which a man will wreak his rage
on the helpless; but they are the exception to the general testi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">[797]</a></span>mony
of the people themselves. So far as general purity of
society goes, one may well doubt whether such abominable conduct
as is legalized among Mormons in Utah is any improvement
on the hardships of woman among the Chinese.</p>

<p>Pursuing this brief account of the social life of the Chinese,
the right of parents in managing their children comes into notice.
It is great, though not unlimited, and in allowing them
very extensive power, legislators have supposed that natural
affection of the parents, a desire to continue the honorable succession
of the family, together with the influence of proper
education, were as good securities against paternal cruelty and
neglect as any laws which could be made. Fathers give their
sons the <i>ju ming</i>, or ‘milk name,’ about a month after birth.
The mother, on the day appointed for this ceremony, worships
and thanks the goddess of Mercy, and the boy, dressed and
having his head shaved, is brought into the circle of assembled
friends, where the father confers the name and celebrates the
occasion by a feast. The milk name is kept until the lad enters
school, at which time the <i>shu ming</i>, or ‘school name,’ is conferred
upon him, as already mentioned. The <i>shu ming</i> generally
consists of two characters, selected with reference to the
boy’s condition, prospects, studies, or some other event connected
with him; sometimes the milk name is continued, as the
family have become accustomed to it. Such names as <i>Ink-grinder</i>,
<i>Promising-study</i>, <i>Opening-olive</i>, <i>Entering-virtue</i>, <i>Rising-advancement</i>,
etc., are given to young students at this time.
Though endearing or fanciful names are often conferred, it is
quite as common to vilify very young children by calling them
<i>dog</i>, <i>hog</i>, <i>puppy</i>, <i>flea</i>, etc., under the idea that such epithets
will ward off the evil eye. Girls have only their milk and
marriage names; the former may be <i>a flower</i>, <i>a sister</i>, <i>a gem</i>,
or such like; the latter are terms like <i>Emulating the Moon</i>,
<i>Orchis Flower</i>, <i>the Jasmine</i>, <i>Delicate Perfume</i>, etc. A mere
number at Canton, as <i>A-yat</i>, <i>A-sam</i>, <i>A-luk</i> (No. 1, No. 3, No. 6),
often designates the boys till they get their book names.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[798]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">NUMBER AND CHANGES OF PERSONAL NAMES.</div>

<p>The personal names of the Chinese are written contrariwise
to our own, the <i>sing</i>, or surname, coming first, then the <i>ming</i>, or
given name, and then the complimentary title; as Liang Wăntai
siensăng, where <i>Liang</i>, or ‘Millet,’ is the family name, <i>Wăntai</i>,
or ‘Terrace of Letters,’ the given name, and <i>siensăng</i>, Mr.
(<i>i.e.</i>, Master), or ‘Teacher.’ A few of the surnames are double,
as <i>Sz’ma Tsien</i>, where Sz’ma is the family name and Tsien the
official title. A curious idea prevails among the people of Canton,
that foreigners have no surname, which, as Pliny thought
of the inhabitants of Mt. Atlas, they regard as one of the proofs
of their barbarism; perhaps this notion came by inference from
the fact that the Manchus write only their given name, as
Kíshen, Kíying, Ílípu, etc. When writing Chinese names in
translations and elsewhere, some attention should be paid to
these particulars; the names of Chinese persons and places are
constantly appearing in print under forms as singular as would
be <i>Williamhenryharrison</i>, <i>Rich-Ard-Ox-Ford</i>, or <i>Phila Delphia-city</i>
in English. The name being in a different language,
and its true nature unknown to most of those who write it, accounts
for the misarrangement.</p>

<p>In Canton and its vicinity the names of people are abbreviated
in conversation to one character, and an <i>A</i> prefixed to it;&mdash;as
<i>Tsinteh</i>, called <i>A-teh</i> or <i>A-tsin</i>. In Amoy the <i>A</i> is placed
after, as <i>Chin-a</i>; in the northern provinces no such usage is
known. Some families, perhaps in imitation of the imperial
precedent, distinguish their members from others in the clan
by adopting a constant character for the first one in the <i>ming</i>, or
given name; thus a family of brothers will be named Lin
Tung-pei, Lin Tung-fung, Lin Tung-peh, where the word <i>Tung</i>
distinguishes this sept of the clan Lin from all others. There
are no characters exclusively appropriated to proper names or
different sexes, as George, Agnes, etc., all being chosen out of
the language with reference to their meanings. Consequently,
a name is sometimes felt to be incongruous, as Naomi, when
saluted on her return to Bethlehem, felt its inappropriateness
to her altered condition, and suggested a change to Mara. Puns
on names and sobriquets are common, from the constant contrast
of the sounds of the characters with circumstances sug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">[799]</a></span>gesting
a comparison or a play upon their meanings; sly jokes
are also played when writing the names of foreigners, by choosing
such characters as will make a ridiculous meaning when
read according to their sense and not their sound.</p>

<p>When a man marries he adopts a third name, called <i>tsz’</i>, or
‘style,’ by which he is usually known through life; this is
either entirely new or combined from previous names. When
a girl is married her family name becomes her given name,
and the given name is disused, her husband’s name becoming
her family name. Thus <i>Wa Salah</i> married to <i>Wei San-wei</i>
drops the <i>Salah</i>, and is called <i>Wei Wa shí</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, Mrs. Wei [born
of the clan] Wa, though her husband or near relatives sometimes
retain it as a trivial address. A man is frequently known
by another compellation, called <i>pieh tsz’</i>, or ‘second style,’
which the public do not presume to employ. When a young
man is successful in attaining a degree, or enters an office, he
takes a title called <i>kwan ming</i>, or ‘official name,’ by which he
is known to government. The members or heads of licensed
mercantile companies each have an official name, which is entered
in their permit, from whence it is called among foreigners
their <i>chop name</i>. Each of the heads of the co-hong formerly
licensed to trade with foreigners at Canton had such an
official name. Besides these various names, old men of fifty,
shopkeepers, and others take a <i>hao</i>, or ‘designation;’ tradesmen
use it on their signboards as the name of their shop, and
not unfrequently receive it as their personal appellation. Of
this nature are the appellations of the tradesmen who deal with
foreigners, as <i>Cutshing</i>, <i>Chanlung</i>, <i>Linchong</i>, etc., which are
none of them the names of the shopmen, but the designation of
the shop. It is the usual way in Canton for foreigners to go
into a shop and ask “Is Mr. Wanglik in?” which would be almost
like one in New York inquiring if Mr. Alhambra or Mr.
Atlantic-House was at home, though it does not sound quite so
ridiculous to a Chinese. The names taken by shopkeepers allude
to trade or its prospects, such as <i>Mutual Advantage</i>, <i>Obedient
Profit</i>, <i>Extensive Harmony</i>, <i>Rising Goodness</i>, <i>Great
Completeness</i>, etc.; the names of the partners as such are not
employed to form the firm. Besides this use of the <i>hao</i>, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800">[800]</a></span>
also employed as a brand upon goods; the terms <i>Hoyuen</i>,
<i>Kinghing</i>, <i>Yuenkí</i>, meaning ‘Harmonious Springs,’ ‘Cheering
Prospects,’ ‘Fountain’s Memorial,’ etc., are applied to particular
parcels of tea, silk, or other goods, just as brands are placed on
lots of wine, flour, or pork. This is called <i>tsz’-hao</i>, or ‘mark-designation,’
but foreigners call both it and the goods it denotes
a <i>chop</i>.</p>

<p>When a man dies he receives another and last, though not
necessarily a new name in the hall of ancestors; upon emperors
and empresses are bestowed new ones, as <i>Benevolent</i>, <i>Pious</i>,
<i>Discreet</i>, etc., by which they are worshipped and referred to in
history, as <i>that</i> designation which is most likely to be permanent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CEREMONIAL OBEISANCE AT COURT.</div>

<p>In their common intercourse the Chinese are not more formal
than is considered to be well-bred in Europe; it is on extraordinary
or official occasions that they observe the precise etiquette
for which they are famous. The proper mode of behavior toward
all classes is perhaps more carefully inculcated upon youth
than it is in the west, and habit renders easy what custom demands.
The ceremonial obeisance of a court or a levee, or the
salutations proper for a festival, are not carried into the everyday
intercourse of life; for as one chief end of the formalities
prescribed for such times is to teach due subordination among
persons of different rank, they are in a measure laid aside with
the robes which suggested them. True politeness, exhibited in
an unaffected regard for the feelings of others, cannot, we
know, be taught by rules; but a great degree of urbanity and
kindness is everywhere shown, whether owing to the naturally
placable disposition of the people or to the effects of their early
instruction in the forms of politeness. Whether in the crowded
and narrow thoroughfares, the village green, the market, the
jostling ferry, or the thronged procession&mdash;wherever the people
are assembled promiscuously, good humor and courtesy are observable;
and when altercations do arise wounds or serious injuries
seldom ensue, although from the furious clamor one
would imagine that half the crowd were in danger of their
lives.</p>

<p>Chinese ceremonial requires superiors to be honored according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">[801]</a></span>
to their station and age, and equals to depreciate themselves
while lauding those they address. The Emperor, considering
himself as the representative of divine power, exacts the same
prostration which is paid the gods; and the ceremonies which
are performed in his presence partake, therefore, of a religious
character, and are not merely particular forms of etiquette,
which may be altered according to circumstances. There are
eight gradations of obeisance, commencing with “the lowest
form of respect, called <i>kung shao</i>, which is merely joining the
hands and raising them before the breast. The next is <i>tso yih</i>,
bowing low with the hands thus joined. The third is <i>ta tsien</i>,
bending the knee as if about to kneel; and <i>kwei</i>, an actual
kneeling, is the fourth. The fifth is <i>ko tao</i> (<i>kotow</i>), kneeling
and striking the head on the ground, which when thrice repeated
makes the sixth, called <i>san kao</i>, or ‘thrice knocking.’
The seventh is the <i>luh kao</i>, or kneeling and knocking the head
thrice upon the ground, then standing upright and again kneeling
and knocking the head three times more. The climax is
closed by the <i>san kwei kiu kao</i>, or thrice kneeling and nine
times knocking the head. Some of the gods of China are entitled
to the <i>san kao</i>, others to the <i>luh kao</i>, while the Emperor
and Heaven are worshipped by the last. The family now on
the throne consider this last form as expressing in the strongest
manner the submission and homage of one state to another.”<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
The extreme submission which the Emperor demands is partaken
by and transferred to his officers of every grade in a
greater or less degree; the observance of these forms is deemed,
therefore, of great importance, and a refusal to render them is
considered to be nearly equivalent to a rejection of their authority.</p>

<p>Minute regulations for the times and modes of official intercourse
are made and promulgated by the Board of Rites, and to
learn and practise them is one indispensable part of official duty.
In court the master of ceremonies stands in a conspicuous place,
and with a loud voice commands the courtiers to rise and kneel,
stand or march, just as an orderly sergeant directs the drill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">[802]</a></span>
recruits. The same attention to the ritual is observed in their
mutual intercourse, for however much an inferior may desire
to dispense with the ceremony, his superior will not fail to exact
it. In the salutations of entrée and exit among officers
these forms are particularly conspicuous, but when well acquainted
with each other, and in moments of conviviality, they
are in a great measure laid aside; but the juxtaposition of art
and nature among them, at one moment laughing and joking,
and the next bowing and kneeling to each other as if they had
never met, sometimes produces amusing scenes to a foreigner.
The entire ignorance and disregard of these forms by foreigners
unacquainted with the code leaves a worse impression upon
the natives at times, who ascribe such rudeness to hauteur and
contempt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ETIQUETTE OF FORMAL VISITING.</div>

<p>Without particularizing the tedious forms of official etiquette,
it will be sufficient to describe what is generally required in
good society. Military men pay visits on horseback; civilians
and others go in sedans or carts; to walk is not common. Visiting
cards are made of vermilioned paper cut into slips about
eight inches long and three wide, and are single or folded four,
six, eight, or more times, according to the position of the visitor.
If he is in recent mourning, the paper is white and the
name written in blue ink, but after a stated time this is indicated
by an additional character. The simple name is stamped
on the upper right corner, or if written on the lower corner,
with an addition thus, “Your humble servant (<i>lit.</i>, ‘stupid
younger brother’) Pí Chí-wăn bows his head in salutation.” On
approaching the house his attendant hands a card to the doorkeeper,
and if he cannot be received, instead of saying “not at
home,” the host sends out to “stay the gentleman’s approach,”
and the card is left. If contrariwise the sedan is carried through
the doorway into the court, where he comes forth to receive his
guest; as the latter steps out each one advances just so far, bowing
just so many times, and going through the ceremonies which they
mutually understand and expect, until both have taken their seats
at the head of the hall, the guest sitting on the left of the host,
and his companions, if he have any, in the chairs on each side.
The inquiries made after the mutual welfare of friends and each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[803]</a></span>
other are couched in a form of studied laudation and depreciation,
which when literally translated seem somewhat affected,
but to them convey no more than similar civilities do among
ourselves&mdash;in truth, perhaps not so much of sincere good-will.
For instance, to the remark, “It is a long time since we have
met, sir,” the host replies (literally), “How presume to receive
the trouble of your honorable footsteps; is the person
in the chariot well?”&mdash;which is simply equivalent to, “I
am much obliged for your visit, and hope you enjoy good
health.”</p>

<p>Tea and pipes are always presented, together with betel-nut
or sweetmeats on some occasions, but it is not, as among the
Turks, considered disrespectful to refuse them, though it would
be looked upon as singular. If the guest inquire after the health
of relatives he should commence with the oldest living, and then
ask how many sons the host has; but it is not considered good
breeding for a formal acquaintance to make any remarks respecting
the mistress of the house. If the sons of the host are
at home they are generally sent for, and make their obeisance to
their father’s friend by coming up before him and performing
the <i>kotow</i> as rapidly as possible, each one making haste, as if he
did not wish to delay him. The guest raises them with a slight
bow, and the lads stand facing him at a respectful distance. He
will then remark, perhaps, if one of them happen to be at his
studies, that “the boy will perpetuate the literary reputation of
his family” (<i>lit.</i>, ‘he will fully carry on the fragrance of the
books’); to which his father rejoins, “The reputation of our
family is not great (<i>lit.</i>, ‘hills and fields’ happiness is thin’); high
expectations are not to be entertained of him; if he can only
gain a livelihood it will be enough.” After a few such compliments
the boys say <i>shao pei</i>, ‘slightly waiting on you,’ <i>i.e.</i>,
pray excuse us, and retire. Girls are seldom brought in, and
young ladies never.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORMALITIES OF ADDRESS AND GREETING.</div>

<p>The periphrases employed to denote persons and thus avoid
speaking their names in a measure indicate the estimation in
which they are held. For instance, “Does the honorable great
man enjoy happiness?” means “Is your father well?” “Distinguished
and aged one what honorable age?” is the mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">[804]</a></span>
asking how old he is; for among the Chinese, as it seems to
have been among the Egyptians, it is polite to ask the names and
ages of all ranks and sexes. “The old man of the house,”
“excellent honorable one,” and “venerable great prince,” are
terms used by a visitor to designate the father of his host. A
child terms his father “family’s majesty,” “old man of the
family,” “prince of the family,” or “venerable father.” When
dead a father is called “former prince,” and a mother “venerable
great one in repose;” and there are particular characters to
distinguish deceased parents from living. The request, “Make
my respects to your mother”&mdash;for no Chinese gentleman ever
asks to <em>see</em> the ladies&mdash;is literally, “Excellent-longevity hall place
in my behalf wish repose,” the first two words denoting she who
remains there. Care should be taken not to use the same expressions
when speaking of the relatives of the guest and one’s
own; thus, in asking, “How many worthy young gentlemen
[sons] have you?” the host replies, “I am unfortunate in having
had but one boy,” literally, “My fate is niggardly; I have only
one little bug.” This runs through their whole Chesterfieldian
code. A man calls his wife <i>tsien nui</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘the mean one of the
inner apartments,’ or ‘the foolish one of the family;’ while
another speaking of her calls her “the honorable lady,” “worthy
lady,” “your favored one,” etc.</p>

<p>Something of this is found in all oriental languages; to become
familiar with the right application of these terms in Chinese,
as elsewhere in the east, is no easy lesson for a foreigner.
In their salutations of ceremony they do not, however, quite
equal the Arabs, with their kissing, bowing, touching foreheads,
stroking beards, and repeated motions of obeisance. The Chinese
seldom embrace or touch each other, except on unusual
occasions of joy or among family friends; in fact, they have
hardly a common word for a kiss. When the visitor rises to depart
he remarks, “Another day I will come to receive your instructions;”
to which his friend replies, “You do me too much
honor; I rather ought to wait on you to-morrow.” The common
form of salutation among equals is for each to clasp his own
hands before his breast and make a slight bow, saying, <i>Tsing!
Tsing!</i> <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Hail! Hail!’ This is repeated by both at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">[805]</a></span>
same time, on meeting as well as separating.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> The formalities
of leave-taking correspond to those of receiving, but if the parties
are equal, or nearly so, the host sees his friend quite to the
door and into his sedan.</p>

<p>Officers avoid meeting each other, especially in public, except
when etiquette requires them. An officer of low rank is obliged
to stop his chair or horse, and on his feet to salute his
superior, who receives and returns the civility without moving.
Those of equal grades leave their places and go through a mock
struggle of deference to get each first to return to it. The common
people never presume to salute an officer in the streets, nor
even to look at him very carefully. In his presence, they speak
to him on their knees, but an old man, or one of consideration,
is usually requested to rise when speaking, and even criminals
with gray hairs are treated with respect. Officers do not allow
their inferiors to sit in their presence, and have always been unwilling
to concede this to foreigners; those of the lowest rank
consider themselves far above the best of such visitors, but this
affectation of rank is already passing away. The converse, of
not paying them proper respect, is more common among a certain
class of foreigners.</p>

<p>Children are early taught the forms of politeness toward all
ranks. The duties owed by younger to elder brothers are peculiar,
the firstborn having a sort of birthright in the ancestral
worship, in the division of property, and in the direction of the
family after the father’s decease. The degree of formality in
the domestic circle inculcated in the ancient <cite>Book of Rites</cite> is
never observed to its full extent, and would perhaps chill the
affection which should exist among its members, did not habit
render it easy and proper; and the extent to which it is actually
carried depends a good deal upon the education of the family.
In forwarding presents it is customary to send a list with the
note, and if the person deems it proper to decline some of them,
he marks on the list those he takes and returns the rest; a douceur
is always expected by the bearer, and needy fellows some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">[806]</a></span>times
pretend to have been sent with some insignificant present
from a grandee in hopes of receiving more than its equivalent
as a cumshaw from the person thus honored. De Guignes mentioned
one donor who waited until the list came back, and then
sent out and purchased the articles which had been marked and
sent them to his friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CUSTOMS AT DINNER.</div>

<p>Travellers have so often described the Chinese formal dinners,
that they have almost become one of their national traits in the
view of foreigners; so many of these banquets, however, were
given by or in the name of the sovereign, that they are hardly
a fair criterion of usual private feasts. The Chinese are both a
social and a sensual people, and the pleasures of the table form
a principal item in the list of their enjoyments; nor are the
higher delights of mental recreation altogether wanting, though
this part of the entertainment is according to their taste and not
ours. Private meals and public feasts among the higher classes
are both dull and long to us, because ladies do not participate;
but perhaps we judge more what our own tables would be without
their cheerful presence, while in China each sex is of the
opinion that the meal is more enjoyable without interference
from the other.</p>

<p>An invitation to dinner is written on a slip of red paper like
a visiting-card, and sent some days before. It reads, “On the &mdash;
day a trifling entertainment will await the light of your countenance.
Tsau San-wei’s compliments.” Another card is sent
on the day itself, stating the hour of dinner, or a servant comes
to call the guests. The host, dressed in his cap and robes,
awaits their arrival, and after they are all assembled, requests
them to follow his example and lay aside their dresses of ceremony.
The usual way of arranging guests is by twos on each
side of small uncovered tables, placed in lines; an arrangement
as convenient for serving the numerous courses which compose
the feast, and removing the dishes, as was the Roman fashion
of reclining around a hollow table; it also allows a fair view of
the musical or theatrical performances. On some occasions, in
the sunny south, however, a single long or round table is laid
out in a tasteful manner, having pyramids of cakes alternating
with piles of fruits and dishes of preserves, all covered more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[807]</a></span>
less with flowers, while the table itself is partly hidden from
view by nosegays and leaves. If the party be large, ten
minutes or more are consumed by the host and guests going
through a tedious repetition of requests and refusals to take the
highest seats, for not a man will sit down until he sees the host
occupying his chair.</p>

<p>On commencing, the host, standing up, salutes his guests, in
a cup, apologizing for the frugal board before them, his only
desire being to show his respects to them. At a certain period
in the entertainment, they reply by simultaneously rising and
drinking his health. The Western custom of giving a sentiment
is not known; and politeness requires a person when drinking
healths to turn the bottom of the tiny wine-cup upward to
show that it is drained. Glass dishes are gradually becoming
cheap and common among the middle class, but the table furniture
still mainly consists of porcelain cups, bowls, and saucers
of various sizes and quality, porcelain spoons shaped like a
child’s pap-boat, and two smooth sticks made of bamboo, ivory,
or wood, of the size of quills, well known as the <i>chop-sticks</i>,
from the native name <i>kwai tsz’</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘nimble lads.’ Grasping
these implements on each side of the forefinger, the eater
pinches up from the dishes meat, fish, or vegetables, already
cut into mouthfuls, and conveys one to his mouth. The bowl
of rice or millet is brought to the lips, and the contents shovelled
into the mouth in an expeditious manner, quite suitable to the
name of the tools employed. Less convenient than forks, chopsticks
are a great improvement on fingers, as every one will
acknowledge who has seen the Hindus throw the balls of curried
rice into their mouths.</p>

<p>The succession of dishes is not uniform; soups, meats, stews,
fruits, and preserves are introduced somewhat at the discretion
of the major-domo, but the end is announced by a bowl of plain
rice and a cup of tea. The fruit is often brought in after a
recess, during which the guests rise and refresh themselves by
walking and chatting, for three or four hours are not unfrequently
required even to taste all the dishes. It is not deemed
impolite for a guest to express his satisfaction with the good
fare before him, and exhibit evidences of having stuffed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">[808]</a></span>
to repletion; nor is it a breach of manners to retire before the
dinner is ended. The guests relieve its tedium by playing the
game of <i>chai mei</i>, or morra (the <i>micare digitis</i> of the old Romans),
which consists in showing the fingers to each other
across the table, and mentioning a number at the same moment;
as, if one opens out two fingers and mentions the number four,
the other instantly shows six fingers, and repeats that number.
If he mistake in giving the complement of ten, he pays a forfeit
by drinking a cup. This convivial game is common among
all ranks, and the boisterous merriment of workmen or friends
at their meals is frequently heard as one passes through the
streets in the afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> The Chinese generally have but two
meals a day, breakfast at nine and dinner at four, or thereabouts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TEMPERANCE OF THE CHINESE.</div>

<p>The Chinese are comparatively a temperate people. This
is owing principally to the universal use of tea, but also to taking
their arrack very warm and at their meals, rather than to
any notions of sobriety or dislike of spirits. A little of it
flushes their faces, mounts into their heads, and induces them
when flustered to remain in the house to conceal the suffusion,
although they may not be really drunk. This liquor is known
as toddy, arrack, saki, tsiu, and other names in Eastern Asia,
and is distilled from the yeasty liquor in which boiled rice has
fermented under pressure many days. Only one distillation is
made for common liquor, but when more strength is wanted, it
is distilled two or three times, and it is this strong spirit alone
which is rightly called <i>samshu</i>, a word meaning ‘thrice fired.’
Chinese moralists have always inveighed against the use of
spirits, and the name of Í-tih, the reputed inventor of the deleterious
drink, more than two thousand years before Christ,
has been handed down with opprobrium, as he was himself banished
by the great Yu for his discovery.</p>

<p>The <cite>Shu King</cite> contains a discourse by the Duke of Chau on
the abuse of spirits. His speech to his brother Fung, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1120,
is the oldest temperance address on record, even earlier than
the words of Solomon in the Proverbs. “When your reverend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">[809]</a></span>
father, King Wăn, founded our kingdom in the western region,
he delivered announcements and cautions to the princes of the
various states, their officers, assistants, and managers of affairs,
morning and evening, saying, ‘For sacrifices spirits should be
employed. When Heaven was sending down its [favoring]
commands and laying the foundations of our people’s sway,
spirits were used only in the great sacrifices. [But] when
Heaven has sent down its terrors, and our people have thereby
been greatly disorganized, and lost their [sense of] virtue, this
too can be ascribed to nothing else than their unlimited use of
spirits; yea, further, the ruin of the feudal states, small and
great, may be traced to this one sin, the free use of spirits.’
King Wăn admonished and instructed the young and those in
office managing public affairs, that they should not habitually
drink spirits. In all the states he enjoined that their use be
confined to times of sacrifices; and even then with such limitations
that virtue should prevent drunkenness.”<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>The general and local festivals of the Chinese are numerous,
among which the first three days of the year, one or two about
the middle of April to worship at the tombs, the two solstices,
and the festival of dragon-boats, are common days of relaxation
and merry-making, only on the first, however, are the shops
shut and business suspended. Some persons have expressed
their surprise that the unceasing round of toil which the Chinese
laborer pursues has not rendered him more degraded. It
is usually said that a weekly rest is necessary for the continuance
of the powers of body and mind in man in their full activity,
and that decrepitude and insanity would oftener result
were it not for this relaxation. The arguments in favor of this
observation seem to be deduced from undoubted facts in countries
where the obligations of the Sabbath are acknowledged,
though where the vast majority cease from business and labor,
it is not easy for a few to work all the time even if they wish,
owing to the various ways in which their occupations are involved
with those of others; yet, in China, people who appa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">[810]</a></span>rently
tax themselves uninterruptedly to the utmost stretch of
body and mind, live in health to old age. A few facts of this
sort incline one to suppose that the Sabbath was designed by
its Lord as a day of rest for man from a constant routine of relaxation
and mental and physical labor, in order that he might
have leisure for attending to the paramount duties of religion,
and not alone as a day of relaxation and rest, without which
they could not live out all their days. Nothing like a seventh
day of rest, or religious respect to that interval of time, is
known among the Chinese, but they do not, as a people, exercise
their minds to the intensity, or upon the high subjects
common among Western nations, and this perhaps is one reason
why their yearly toil produces no disastrous effects. The countless
blessings which flow from an observance of the fourth commandment
can be better appreciated by witnessing the wearied
condition of the society where it is not acknowledged, and whoever
sees such a society can hardly fail to wish for its introduction.</p>

<p>Converts to Christianity in China, who are instructed in its
strict observance, soon learn to prize it as a high privilege; and
its general neglect among the native Roman Catholics has removed
the only apparent difference between them and the
pagans. The former prime minister of China once remarked
that among the few really valuable things which foreigners had
brought to China, the rest of the Sabbath day was one of the
most desirable; he often longed for a quiet day.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">NEW YEAR’S CUSTOMS AND CEREMONIES.</div>

<p>The return of the year is an occasion of unbounded festivity
and hilarity, as if the whole population threw off the old year
with a shout, and clothed themselves in the new with their
change of garments. The evidences of the approach of this
chief festival appear some weeks previous. The principal streets
are lined with tables, upon which articles of dress, furniture,
and fancy are disposed for sale in the most attractive manner.
Necessity compels many to dispose of certain of their treasures
or superfluous things at this season, and sometimes exceedingly
curious bits of bric-a-brac, long laid up in families, can be pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[811]</a></span>cured
at a cheap rate. It is customary for superiors to give
their dependents and employees a present, and for shopmen to
send an acknowledgment of favors to their customers; one of
the most common gifts among the lower classes is a pair of new
shoes. Among the tables spread in the streets are many provided
with pencils and red paper of various sizes, on which persons
write sentences appropriate to the season in various styles,
to be pasted upon the doorposts and lintels of dwellings and
shops,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> or suspended from their walls. The shops also put on a
most brilliant appearance, arrayed in these papers interspersed
among the <i>kin hwa</i>, or ‘golden flowers,’ which are sprigs of artificial
leaves and flowers made in the southern cities of brass tinsel
and fastened upon wires; the latter are designed for an
annual offering in temples, or to place before the household tablet.
Small strips of red and gilt paper, some bearing the word
<i>fuh</i>, or ‘happiness,’ large and small vermilion candles, gaily
painted, and other things used in idolatry, are likewise sold in
great quantities, and with the increased throng impart an unusually
lively appearance to the streets. Another evident sign
of the approaching change is the use of water upon the doors,
shutters, and other woodwork of houses and shops, washing
chairs, utensils, clothes, etc., as if cleanliness had not a little to
do with joy, and a well-washed person and tenement were indispensable
to the proper celebration of the festival. Throughout
the southern rivers all small craft, tankia-boats, and lighters are
beached and turned inside out for a scrubbing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SETTLING ACCOUNTS AND DECORATING HOUSES.</div>

<p>A still more praiseworthy custom attending this season is that
of settling accounts and paying debts; shopkeepers are kept
busy waiting upon their customers, and creditors urge their
debtors to arrange these important matters. No debt is allowed
to overpass new year without a settlement or satisfactory arrangement,
if it can be avoided; and those whose liabilities altogether
exceed their means are generally at this season obliged to wind
up their concerns and give all their available property into the
hands of their creditors. The consequences of this general pay-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[812]</a></span>
are a high rate of money, great resort to the pawnbrokers,
and a general fall in the price of most kinds of produce and
commodities. Many good results flow from the practice, and
the conscious sense of the difficulty and expense of resorting
to legal proceedings to recover debts induces all to observe
and maintain it, so that the dishonest, the unsuccessful, and
the wild speculator may be sifted out from amongst the honest
traders.</p>

<p>De Guignes mentions one expedient to oblige a man to pay
his debts at this season, which is to carry off the door of his
shop or house, for then his premises and person will be exposed
to the entrance and anger of all hungry and malicious demons
prowling around the streets, and happiness no more revisit his
abode; to avoid this he is fain to arrange his accounts. It
is a common practice among devout persons to settle with the
gods, and during a few days before the new year, the temples
are unusually thronged by devotees, both male and female, rich
and poor. Some persons fast and engage the priests to intercede
for them that their sins may be pardoned, while they prostrate
themselves before the images amidst the din of gongs, drums,
and bells, and thus clear off the old score. On new year’s eve
the streets are full of people hurrying to and fro to conclude the
many matters which press upon them. At Canton, some are
busy pasting the five slips upon their lintels, signifying their
desire that the five blessings which constitute the sum of all
human felicity (namely, longevity, riches, health, love of virtue,
and a natural death) may be their favored portion. Such sentences
as “May the five blessings visit this door,” “May heaven
send down happiness,” “May rich customers ever enter this
door,” are placed above them; and the doorposts are adorned
with others on plain or gold sprinkled red paper, making the
entrance quite picturesque. In the hall are suspended scrolls
more or less costly, containing antithetical sentences carefully
chosen. A literary man would have, for instance, a distich like
the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">May I be so learned as to secrete in my mind three myriads of volumes:</div>
      <div class="verse">May I know the affairs of the world for six thousand years.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[813]</a></span></p>
<p>A shopkeeper adorns his door with those relating to trade:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">May profits be like the morning sun rising on the clouds.</div>
      <div class="verse">May wealth increase like the morning tide which brings the rain.</div>
      <div class="verse">Manage your occupation according to truth and loyalty.</div>
      <div class="verse">Hold on to benevolence and rectitude in all your trading.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The influence of these mottoes, and countless others like them
which are constantly seen in the streets, shops, and dwellings
throughout the land, is inestimable. Generally it is for good,
and as a large proportion are in the form of petition or wish,
they show the moral feeling of the people.</p>

<p>Boat-people in Kwangtung and Fuhkien provinces are peculiarly
liberal of their paper prayers, pasting them on every board
and oar in the boat, and suspending them from the stern in scores,
making the vessel flutter with gaiety. Farmers stick theirs
upon barns, trees, wattles, baskets, and implements, as if nothing
was too insignificant to receive a blessing. The house is arranged
in the most orderly and cleanly manner, and purified
with religious ceremonies and lustrations, firing of crackers, etc.,
and as the necessary preparations occupy a considerable portion
of the night, the streets are not quiet till dawn. In addition
to the bustle arising from business and religious observances,
which marks this passage of time, the constant explosion of fire-crackers,
and the clamor of gongs, make it still more noisy.
Strings of these crackling fireworks are burned at the doorposts,
before the outgoing and incoming of the year, designed to expel
and deter evil spirits from the house. The consumption is
so great as to cover the streets with the fragments, and farmers
come the week after into Canton city and sweep up hundreds of
bushels for manure.</p>

<p>The first day of the year is also regarded as the birthday of
the entire population, for the practice among the Hebrews of
dating the age from the beginning of the year, prevails also in
China; so that a child born only a week before new year, is considered
as entering its second year on the first day of the first
month. This does not, however, entirely supersede the observance
of the real anniversary, and parents frequently make a solemnity
of their son’s birthday. A missionary thus describes the cele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[814]</a></span>bration
of a son’s sixth birthday at Ningpo. “The little fellow
was dressed in his best clothes, and his father had brought gilt
paper, printed prayers, and a large number of bowls of meats,
rice, vegetables, spirits, nuts, etc., as an offering to be spread
out before the idols. The ceremonies were performed in the
apartment of the <i>Tao Mu</i>, or ‘Bushel Mother,’ who has special
charge of infants before and after birth. The old abbot
was dressed in a scarlet robe, with a gilt image of a serpent
fastened in his hair; one of the monks wore a purple, another
a gray robe. A multitude of prayers, seemingly a round of
repetitions, were read by the abbot, occasionally chanting a little,
when the attendants joined in the chorus, and a deafening
clamor of bells, cymbals, and wooden blocks, added force to
their cry; genuflexions and prostrations were repeatedly made.
One part of the ceremony was to pass a live cock through a barrel,
which the assistants performed many times, shouting some
strange words at each repetition; this act symbolized the dangers
through which the child was to pass in his future life, and
the priests had prayed that he might as safely come out of them
all, as the cock had passed through the barrel. In conclusion,
some of the prayers were burned and a libation poured out, and
a grand symphony of bell, gong, drum, and block, closed the
scene.”<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>A great diversity of local usages are observed at this period
in different parts of the country. In Amoy, the custom of
“surrounding the furnace” is generally practised. The members
of the family sit down to a substantial supper on new year’s
eve, with a pan of charcoal under the table, as a supposed preservative
against fires. After the supper is ended, the wooden
lamp-stands are brought out and spread upon the pavement with
a heap of gold and silver paper, and set on fire after all demons
have been warned off by a volley of fire-crackers. The embers
are then divided into twelve heaps, and their manner of going
out carefully watched as a prognostic of the kind of weather to
be expected the ensuing year. Many persons wash their bodies
in warm water, made aromatic by the infusion of leaves, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[815]</a></span>
security against disease; this ceremony, and ornamenting the
ancestral shrine, and garnishing the whole house with inscriptions,
pictures, flowers, and fruit, in the gayest manner
the means of the family will allow, occupy most of the
night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CALLS AND COMPLIMENTS AT NEW YEAR’S.</div>

<p>The stillness of the streets and the gay inscriptions on the
closed shops on new year’s morning present a wonderful contrast
to the usual bustle and crowd, resembling the Christian
Sabbath. The red papers of the doors are here and there interspersed
with the blue ones, announcing that during the past
year death has come among the inmates of the house; a silent
but expressive intimation to passers that some who saw the last
new year have passed away. In certain places, white, yellow,
and carnation colored papers are employed, as well as blue, to
distinguish the degree of the deceased kindred. Etiquette requires
that those who mourn remain at home at this period.
By noontide the streets begin to be filled with well-dressed persons,
hastening in sedans or afoot to make their calls; those
who cannot afford to buy a new suit hire one for this purpose,
so that a man hardly knows his own domestics in their finery
and robes. The meeting of friends in the streets, both bound
on the same errand, is attended with particular demonstrations
of respect, each politely struggling who shall be most affectedly
humble. On this day parents receive the prostrations of their
children, teachers expect the salutations of their pupils, magistrates
look for the calls of their inferiors, and ancestors of every
generation, and gods of various powers are presented with the
offerings of devotees in the family hall or public temple. Much
of the visiting is done by cards, on which is stamped an emblematic
device representing the three happy wishes&mdash;of children,
rank, and longevity; a common card suffices for distant
acquaintances and customers. It might be a subject of speculation
whether the custom of visiting and renewing one’s acquaintances
on new year’s day, so generally practised among
the Dutch and in America, was not originally imitated from
the Chinese; but as in many other things, so in this, the
westerns have improved upon the easterns, in calling upon
the ladies. Persons, as they meet, salute each other with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">[816]</a></span>
<i>Kung-hí! Kung-hí!</i> ‘I respectfully wish you joy!’&mdash;or <i>Sin-hí!
Sin-hí!</i> ‘May the new joy be yours,’ either of which, from
its use at this season, is quite like the <i>Happy New Year!</i> of
Englishmen.</p>

<p>Toward evening, the merry sounds proceeding from the closed
doors announce that the sacrifice provided for presentation before
the shrines of departed parents is cheering the worshippers;
while the great numbers who resort to gambling-shops show full
well that the routine of ceremony soon becomes tiresome, and a
more exciting stimulus is needed. The extent to which play is
now carried is almost indescribable. Jugglers, mountebanks,
and actors also endeavor to collect a few coppers by amusing
the crowds. Generally speaking, however, the three days devoted
to this festival pass by without turmoil, and business and
work then gradually resume their usual course for another
twelvemonth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DRAGON-BOAT FESTIVAL AND FEAST OF LANTERNS.</div>

<p>The festival of the dragon-boats, on the fifth day of the fifth
month, presents a very different scene wherever there is a serviceable
stream for its celebration. At Canton, long, narrow
boats, holding sixty or more rowers, race up and down the
river in pairs with huge clamor, as if searching for some one
who had been drowned. This festival was instituted in memory
of the statesman Küh Yuen, about 450 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, who drowned himself
in the river Mih-lo, an affluent of Tungting Lake, after
having been falsely accused by one of the petty princes of the
state. The people, who loved the unfortunate courtier for his
fidelity and virtues, sent out boats in search of the body, but to
no purpose. They then made a peculiar sort of rice-cake called
<i>tsung</i>, and setting out across the river in boats with flags and
gongs, each strove to be first on the spot of the tragedy and sacrifice
to the spirit of Küh Yuen. This mode of commemorating
the event has been since continued as an annual holiday.
The bow of the boat is ornamented or carved into the head of
a dragon, and men beating gongs and drums, and waving flags,
inspirit the rowers to renewed exertions. The exhilarating exercise
of racing leads the people to prolong the festival two or
three days, and generally with commendable good humor, but
their eagerness to beat often breaks the boats, or leads them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">[817]</a></span>
into so much danger that the magistrates sometimes forbid the
races in order to save the people from drowning.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>The first full moon of the year is the feast of lanterns, a
childish and dull festival compared with the two preceding. Its
origin is not certainly known, but it was observed as early as
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 700. Its celebration consists in suspending lanterns of different
forms and materials before each door, and illuminating
those in the hall, but their united brilliancy is dimness itself
compared with the light of the moon. At Peking, an exhibition
of transparencies and pictures in the Board of War on this
evening attracts great crowds of both sexes if the weather be
good. Magaillans describes a firework he saw, which was an
arbor covered with a vine, the woodwork of which seemed to
burn, while the trunk, leaves, and clusters of the plant gradually
consumed, yet so that the redness of the grapes, the greenness
of the leaves, and natural brown of the stem were all
maintained until the whole was burned. The feast of lanterns
coming so soon after new year, and being somewhat expensive,
is not so enthusiastically observed in the southern cities. At
the capital this leisure time, when public offices are closed, is
availed of by the jewellers, bric-a-brac dealers, and others to
hold a fair in the courts of a temple in the Wai Ching, where
they exhibit as beautiful a collection of carvings in stone and
gems, bronzes, toys, etc., as is to be seen anywhere in Asia.
The respect with which the crowds of women and children are
treated on these occasions reflects much credit on the people.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of lanterns the Chinese surely excel all
other people; the variety of their forms, their elegant carving,
gilding, and coloring, and the laborious ingenuity and taste displayed
in their construction, render them among the prettiest
ornaments of their dwellings. They are made of paper, silk,
cloth, glass, horn, basket-work, and bamboo, exhibiting an infinite
variety of shapes and decorations, varying in size from a small
hand-light, costing two or three cents, up to a magnificent chandelier,
or a complicated lantern fifteen feet in diameter, contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">[818]</a></span>ing
several lamps within it, and worth three or four hundred
dollars. The uses to which they are applied are not less various
than the pains and skill bestowed upon their construction are
remarkable. One curious kind is called the <i>tsao-ma-tăng</i>, or
‘horse-racing lantern,’ which consists of one, two, or more wire
frames, one within the other, and arranged on the same principle
as the smoke-jack, by which the current of air caused by
the flame sets them revolving. The wire framework is covered
with paper figures of men and animals placed in the midst of
appropriate scenery, and represented in various attitudes; or,
as Magaillans describes them, “You shall see horses run, draw
chariots and till the earth; vessels sailing, kings and princes go
in and out with large trains, and great numbers of people, both
afoot and a horseback, armies marching, comedies, dances, and
a thousand other divertissements and motions represented.”</p>

<p>One of the prettiest shows of lanterns is seen in a festival observed
in the spring or autumn by fisherman on the southern
coasts to propitiate the gods of the waters. An indispensable
part of the procession is a dragon fifty feet or more long, made
of light bamboo frames of the size and shape of a barrel, connected
and covered with strips of colored cotton or silk; the extremities
represent the gaping head and frisking tail. This
monster symbolizes the ruler of the watery deep, and is carried
through the streets by men holding the head and each joint
upon poles, to which are suspended lanterns; as they follow each
other their steps give the body a wriggling, waving motion.
Huge models of fish, similarly lighted, precede the dragon, while
music and fireworks&mdash;the never-failing warning to lurking
demons to keep out of the way&mdash;accompany the procession,
which presents a very brilliant sight as it winds in its course
through the dark streets. These sports and processions give
idolatry its hold upon a people; and although none of them are
required or patronized by government in China as in other
heathen countries, most of the scenes and games which please
the people are recommended by connecting with them the observances
or hopes of religion and the merrymaking of the
festive board.</p>

<p>In the middle of the sixth moon lanterns are hung from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[819]</a></span>
top of a pole placed on the highest part of the house. A single
small lantern is deemed sufficient, but if the night be calm, a
greater display is made by some householders, and especially in
boats, by exhibiting colored glass lamps arranged in various
ways. The illumination of a city like Canton when seen from
a high spot is made still more brilliant by the moving boats on
the river. On one of these festivals at Canton, an almost total
eclipse of the moon called out the entire population, each one
carrying something with which to make a noise, kettles, pans,
sticks, drums, gongs, guns, crackers, and what not to frighten
away the dragon of the sky from his hideous feast. The advancing
shadow gradually caused the myriads of lanterns to show
more and more distinctly and started a still increasing clamor,
till the darkness and the noise were both at their climax; silence
gradually resumed its sway as the moon recovered her fulness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRANGEMENT AND STYLE OF PROCESSIONS.</div>

<p>The Chinese are fond of processions, and if marriages and
funerals be included, have them more frequently than any other
people. Livery establishments are opened in every city and town
where processions are arranged and supplied with everything
necessary for bridal and funeral occasions as well as religious
festivals. Not only are sedans, bands of music, biers, framed
and gilded stands for carrying idols, shrines, and sacrificial
feasts, red boxes for holding the bride’s trousseau, etc., supplied,
but also banners, tables, stands, curiosities, and uniforms in
great variety. The men and boys required to carry them and
perform the various parts of the ceremony are hired, a uniform
hiding their ragged garments and dirty limbs. Guilds often go
to a heavy expense in getting up a procession in honor of their
patron saint, whose image is carried through the streets attended
by the members of the corporation dressed in holiday robes and
boots. The variety and participators of these shows are exceedingly
curious and characteristic of the people’s taste. Here are
seen splendid silken banners worked with rich embroidery,
alternating with young girls bedizened with paint and flowers,
and perched on high seats under an artificial tree or apparently
almost in the air, resting upon frames on men’s shoulders; bands
of music; sacrificial meats and fruits adorned with flowers;
shrines, images, and curious rarities laid out upon red pavilions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[820]</a></span>
boys gaily dressed in official robes and riding upon ponies, or
harnessed up in a covered framework to represent horses, all
so contrived and painted that the spectator can hardly believe
they are not riding Lilliputian ponies no bigger than dogs. A
child standing in a car and carrying a branch on its shoulder, on
one twig of which stands another child on one foot or a girl
holding a plate of cakes in her hand, on the top of which stands
another miss on tiptoe, the whole borne by coolies, sometimes
add to the diversion of the spectacle and illustrate the mechanical
skill of the exhibitors. Small companies dressed in a great
variety of military uniforms, carrying spears, shields, halberds,
etc., now and then volunteer for the occasion, and give it a more
martial appearance. The carpenters at Canton are famous for
their splendid processions in honor of their hero, Lu Pan, in
which also other craftsmen join; for this demi-god corresponds
to the Tubal-cain of Chinese legends, and is now regarded as
the patron of all workmen, though he flourished no longer ago
than the time of Confucius. Besides these festivities and processions,
there are several more strictly religious, such as the
annual mass of the Buddhists, the supplicatory sacrifice of
farmers for a good crop, and others of more or less importance,
which add to the number of days of recreation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEATRICAL REPRESENTATIONS AND PLAY-ACTORS.</div>

<p>Theatrical representations constitute a common amusement,
and are generally connected with the religious celebration of
the festival of the god before whose temple they are exhibited.
They are got up by the priests, who send their neophytes around
with a subscription paper, and then engage as large and skilful
a band of performers as the funds will allow. There are few
permanent buildings erected for theatres, for the Thespian band
still retains its original strolling character, and stands ready to
pack up its trappings at the first call. The erection of sheds
for playing constitutes a separate branch of the carpenter’s
trade; one large enough to accommodate two thousand persons
can be put up in the southern cities in a day, and almost the
only part of the materials which is wasted is the rattan which
binds the posts and mats together. One large shed contains
the stage, and three smaller ones before it enclose an area, and
are furnished with rude seats for the paying spectators. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[821]</a></span>
subscribers’ bounty is acknowledged by pasting red sheets containing
their names and amounts upon the walls of the temple.
The purlieus are let as stands for the sale of refreshments, for
gambling tables, or for worse purposes, and by all these means
the priests generally contrive to make gain of their devotion.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Parties of actors and acrobats can be hired cheaply, and their
performances form part of the festivities of rich families in
their houses to entertain the women and relatives who cannot
go abroad to see them. They are constituted into separate corporations
or guilds, and each takes a distinguishing name, as
the ‘Happy and Blessed company,’ the ‘Glorious Appearing
company,’ etc.</p>

<p>The performances usually extend through three entire days,
with brief recesses for sleeping and eating, and in villages
where they are comparatively rare, the people act as if they
were bewitched, neglecting everything to attend them. The
female parts are performed by lads, who not only paint and
dress like women, but even squeeze their toes into the “golden
lilies,” and imitate, upon the stage, a mincing, wriggling gait.
These fellows personate the voice, tones, and motions of the
sex with wonderful exactness, taking every opportunity, indeed,
that the play will allow to relieve their feet by sitting when on
the boards, or retiring into the green-room when out of the acts.
The acting is chiefly pantomime, and its fidelity shows the excellent
training of the players. This development of their imitative
faculties is probably still more encouraged by the difficulty
the audience find to understand what is said; for owing to
the differences in the dialects, the open construction of the
theatre, the high falsetto or recitative key in which many of the
parts are spoken, and the din of the orchestra intervening between
every few sentences, not one quarter of the people hear
or understand a word.</p>

<p>The scenery is very simple, consisting merely of rudely
painted mats arranged on the back and sides of the stage, a
few tables, chairs, or beds, which successively serve for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">[822]</a></span>
uses, and are brought in and out from the robing-room. The
orchestra sits on the side of the stage, and not only fill up the
intervals with their interludes, but strike a crashing noise by
way of emphasis, or to add energy to the rush of opposing warriors.
No falling curtain divides the acts or scenes, and the
play is carried to its conclusion without intermission. The
dresses are made of gorgeous silks, and present the best specimens
of ancient Chinese costume of former dynasties now to be
seen. The imperfections of the scenery require much to be
suggested by the spectator’s imagination, though the actors
themselves supply the defect in a measure by each man stating
what part he performs, and what the person he represents has
been doing while absent. If a courier is to be sent to a distant
city, away he strides across the boards, or perhaps gets a whip
and cocks up his leg as if mounting a horse, and on reaching
the end of the stage cries out that he has arrived, and there
delivers his message. Passing a bridge or crossing a river
are indicated by stepping up and then down, or by the rolling
motion of a boat. If a city is to be impersonated, two or three
men lie down upon each other, when warriors rush on them
furiously, overthrow the wall which they formed, and take the
place by assault. Ghosts or supernatural beings are introduced
through a wide trap-door in the stage, and, if he thinks it necessary,
the impersonator cries out from underneath that he is
ready, or for assistance to help him up through the hole.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DESCRIPTION OF A PLAY.</div>

<p>Mr. Lay describes a play he saw, in which a medley of celestial
and terrestrial personages were introduced. “The first
scene was intended to represent the happiness and splendor of
beings who inhabit the upper regions, with the sun and moon
and the elements curiously personified playing around them.
The man who personated the sun held a round image of the
sun’s disk, while the female who acted the part of the moon
had a crescent in her hand. The actors took care to move so
as to mimic the conjunction and opposition of these heavenly
bodies as they revolve round in their apparent orbs. The
Thunderer wielded an axe, and leaped and dashed about in a
variety of extraordinary somersaults. After a few turns the
monarch, who had been so highly honored as to find a place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">[823]</a></span>
through the partiality of a mountain nymph, in the abodes of
the happy, begins to feel that no height of good fortune can
secure a mortal against the common calamities of this frail life.
A wicked courtier disguises himself in a tiger’s skin, and in this
garb imitates the animal itself. He rushes into the retired
apartments of the ladies, frightens them out of their wits, and
throws the heir-apparent into a moat. The sisters hurry into
the royal presence, and casting themselves on the ground divulge
the sad intelligence that a tiger has borne off the young
prince, who it appears was the son of the mountain nymph
aforesaid. The loss the bereaved monarch takes so much to
heart, that he renounces the world and deliberates about the
nomination of a successor. By the influence of a crafty woman
he selects a young man who has just sense enough to know that
he is a fool. The settlement of the crown is scarcely finished
when the unhappy king dies, and the blockhead is presently invested
with the crown, but instead of excelling in his new preferment
the lout bemoans his lot in the most awkward strains
of lamentation, and cries, ‘O dear! what shall I do?’ with such
piteous action, and yet withal so truly ludicrous, that the spectator
is at a loss to know whether to laugh or to weep. The
courtier who had taken off the heir and broken the father’s
heart finds the new king an easy tool for prosecuting his traitorous
purposes, and the state is plunged into the depths of
civil discord at home and dangerous wars abroad.</p>

<p>“In the sequel a scene occurred in which the reconciliation
of this court and some foreign prince depends upon the surrender
of a certain obnoxious person. The son-in-law of the
victim is charged with the letter containing this proposal, and
returns to his house and disguises himself for the sake of concealment.
When he reaches the court of the foreign prince he
discovers that he has dropped the letter in changing his clothes,
and narrowly escapes being taken for a spy without his credentials.
He hurries back, calls for his garments, and shakes them
one by one in an agony of self-reproach, but no letter appears.
He sits down, throwing himself with great violence upon the
chair, with a countenance inexpressibly full of torture and despair:
reality could have added nothing to the imitation. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">[824]</a></span>
while every eye was riveted upon him, he called the servant-maid
and inquired if she knew anything about the letter; she
replied she overheard her mistress reading a letter whose contents
were so and so. The mistress had taken her seat at a
distance from him and was nursing her baby; and the instant
he ascertained the letter was in her possession, he looked toward
her with such a smile upon his cheek, and with a flood of
light in his eye, that the whole assembly heaved a loud sigh
of admiration; for the Chinese do not applaud by clapping and
stamping, but express their feelings by an ejaculation that is
between a sigh and a groan. The aim of the husband was to
wheedle his wife out of the letter, and this smile and look of
affection were merely the prelude; for he takes his chair, places
it beside her, lays one hand softly on her shoulder, and fondles
the child with the other in a style so exquisitely natural and so
completely English, that in this dramatic picture it was seen
that nature fashioneth men’s hearts alike. His addresses were,
however, ineffectual, and her father’s life was not sacrificed.”<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>The morals of the Chinese stage, so far as the sentiments of
the pieces are concerned, are better than the acting, which
sometimes panders to depraved tastes, but no indecent exposure,
as of the persons of dancers, is ever seen in China. The audience
stand in the area fronting the stage, or sit in the sheds
around it; the women present are usually seated in the galleries.
The police are at hand to maintain order, but the
crowd, although in an irksome position, and sometimes exposed
to a fierce sun, is remarkably peaceable. Accidents seldom
occur on these occasions, but whenever the people are alarmed
by a crash, or the stage takes fire, loss of life or limb generally
ensues. A dreadful destruction took place at Canton in May,
1845, by the conflagration of a stage during the performances,
by which more than two thousand lives were sacrificed; the
survivors had occasion to remember that fifty persons had been
killed many years before in the same place, and while a play
was going on, by the falling of a wall.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">POPULAR AMUSEMENTS.</div>

<p>Active, manly plays are not popular in the south, and instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825">[825]</a></span>
of engaging in a ball-game or regatta, going to a bowling alley
or fives’ court, to exhibit their strength and skill, young men
lift beams headed with heavy stones, like huge dumb-bells,
to prove their muscle, or kick up their heels in a game of
shuttlecock. The out-door amusements of gentlemen consist in
flying kites, carrying birds on perches and throwing seeds high
in the air for them to catch, sauntering through the fields, or
lazily boating on the water. Pitching coppers, fighting crickets
or quails, tossing up several balls at once, kicking large leaden
balls against each other, snapping sticks, chucking stones, or
guessing the number of seeds in an orange, are plays for
lads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">METHODS AND POPULARITY OF GAMBLING.</div>

<p>Gambling is universal. Hucksters at the roadside are provided
with a cup and saucer, and the clicking of their dice is
heard at every corner. A boy with but two cash prefers to risk
their loss on the throw of a die to simply buying a cake without
trying the chance of getting it for nothing. Gaming-houses
are opened by scores, their keepers paying a bribe to the
local officers, who can hardly be expected to be very severe
against what they were brought up in and daily practise; and
women, in the privacy of their apartments, while away their
time at cards and dominoes. Porters play by the wayside
when waiting for employment, and hardly have the retinue of
an officer seen their superiors enter the house, than they pull
out their cards or dice and squat down to a game. The most
common game of luck played at Canton is called <i>fan tan</i>, or
‘quadrating cash.’ The keeper of the table is provided with
a pile of bright large cash, of which he takes a double handful,
and lays them on the table, covering the pile with a bowl. The
persons standing outside the rail guess the remainder there will
be left after the pile has been divided by four, whether one, two,
three, or nothing, the guess and stake of each person being first
recorded by a clerk; the keeper then carefully picks out the coins
four by four, all narrowly watching his movements. Cheating
is almost impossible in this game, and twenty people can play
at it as easily as two. Chinese cards are smaller and more
numerous than our own; but the dominoes are the same.</p>

<p>Combats between crickets are oftenest seen in the south,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">[826]</a></span>
where the small field sort is common. Two well-chosen combatants
are put into a basin and irritated with a straw until
they rush upon each other with the utmost fury, chirruping as
they make the onset, and the battle seldom ends without a
tragical result in loss of life or limb. Quails are also trained to
mortal combat; two are placed on a railed table, on which a
handful of millet has been strewn, and as soon as one picks up
a kernel the other flies at him with beak, claws, and wings, and
the struggle is kept up till one retreats by hopping into the
hand of his disappointed owner. Hundreds of dollars are occasionally
betted upon these cricket or quail fights, which, if not
as sublime or exciting, are certainly less inhuman than the pugilistic
fights and bull-baits of Christian countries, while both
show the same brutal love of sport at the expense of life.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Boys Gambling with Crickets.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A favorite amusement is the flying of kites. They are made
of paper and silk, in imitation of birds, butterflies, lizards, spectacles,
fish, men, and other objects; but the skill shown in flying
them is more remarkable than the ingenuity displayed in
their construction. The ninth day of the ninth moon is a festival
devoted to this amusement all over the land. Doolittle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">[827]</a></span>
describes them as sometimes resembling a great bird, or a serpent
thirty feet long; at other times the spectator sees a group
of hawks hovering around a centre, all being suspended by one
strong cord, and each hawk-kite controlled and moved by a
separate line. On this day he estimates that as many as thirty
thousand people assemble on the hills around Fuhchau to join
in this amusement if the weather be propitious. Many of
the kites are cut adrift under the belief that, as they float off,
they carry away with them all impending disasters.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Chinese Chess-board.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE CHESS.</div>

<p>The Chinese game of chess is very ancient, for Wu Wang (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
1120) is the reputed inventor, and its rules of playing are so
unlike the Indian game as to suggest an independent origin,
which is confirmed by the peculiar feature of the <i>kiai ho</i>, or
river, running across the board. There are seventy-two squares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">[828]</a></span>
of which eight are run together to form the river, leaving
thirty-two on each side; but as the men stand on the intersection
of the lines, there are ninety positions for the sixteen
pieces used by each player, or twenty-six more than in the
European game. The pieces are arranged for playing as in the
diagram above.</p>

<p>The pieces are like chequer-men in shape, each of the seven
kinds on each side having its name out on the top, and distinguished
by its red or black colors. The four squares near
each edge form the headquarters of the <i>tsiang</i>, or ‘general,’
out of which he and his two <i>sz’</i>, or ‘secretaries,’ cannot move.
On each side of the headquarters are two elephants, two horses,
and two chariots, whose powers are less than our bishop, knight,
and castle, though similar; the chariot is the most powerful
piece. In front of the horses stand two cannoniers, which capture
like our knight but move like our castle. Five <i>pao</i>, soldiers
or pawns, guard the river banks, but cannot return when
once across it in pursuit of the enemy, and get no higher value
when they reach the last row. Each piece is put down in the
point where it captured its man, except the cannoniers; as the
general cannot be taken, the object of each player is to check-mate
him in his headquarters, therefore, by preventing his
moving except into check. The want of a queen and the limited
moves of the men restrict the combinations in the Chinese
game more than in western chess, but it has its own elements
of skill. Literary men and women play it much, and usually
for small stakes. There is another game played less frequently
but one of the most ancient in the Empire. It is called
<i>wei-kí</i>, which may be rendered ‘blockade chess,’ and was
common in the days of the sages, perhaps even earlier
than chess. The board contains three hundred and twenty-four
squares, eighteen each way, and the number of pieces is
three hundred, though both the number of points and of pieces
may be less than this size of the full game. The pieces are
black and white and stand on the crossings of the lines, three
hundred and sixty-one in number. The object of the opponents
is to surround each other’s men and take up the crossings
they occupy, or neutralize their power over those near them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[829]</a></span>
Each player puts down a piece anywhere on the board, and
continues to do so alternately, capturing his adversary’s positions
until all the crossings are occupied and the game is
ended.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>If this sketch of the customs and amusements of the Chinese
in their social intercourse and public entertainments is necessarily
brief, it is perhaps enough to exhibit their character.
Dr. Johnson has well remarked that no man is a hypocrite in
his amusements. The absence of some of the violent and gladiatorial
sports of other countries, and of the adjudication of
doubtful questions by ordeals or duels; the general dislike of a
resort to force, their inability to cope with enemies of vastly
less resources and numbers, and the comparative disesteem of
warlike achievements, all indicate the peaceful traits of Chinese
character. Duels are unknown, assassinations are infrequent,
betting on horse-races is still to begin, and running amuck à la
Malay is unheard of. When two persons fall out upon a matter,
after a vast variety of gesture and huge vociferation of opprobrium,
they will blow off their wrath and separate almost
without touching each other. Some contrarieties in their ideas
and customs from those practised among ourselves have frequently
been noticed by travellers, a few of which are grouped
in the following sketch:</p>



<div class="sidenote">CONTRARIETIES IN CHINESE AND WESTERN USAGE.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On asking the boatman in which direction the harbor lay, I was answered
west-north, and the wind, he said, was west-south; he still further perplexed
my ideas as to our course by getting out his compass and showing me that the
needle pointed south. It was really a needle as to size, weight, and length,
about an inch and a half long, the south end of it painted red, and all the
time quivering on the pivot. His boat differed from our vessels, too, in many
ways: the cooking was done in the stern and the passengers were all accommodated
in the bow, while the sailors slept on deck and had their kits stowed
in lockers amidships.</p>

<p>On landing, the first object that attracted my attention was a military officer
wearing an embroidered petticoat, who had a string of beads around his neck
and a fan in his hand. His insignia of rank was a peacock’s feather pointing
downward instead of a plume turning upward; he had a round knob or button
on the apex of his sugar-loaf cap, instead of a star on his breast or epaulettes
on his shoulders; and it was with some dismay that I saw him mount
his horse on the right side. Several scabbards hung from his belt, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[830]</a></span>
I naturally supposed must be dress swords or dirks; but on venturing near
through the crowd I was undeceived by seeing a pair of chopsticks and a
knife-handle sticking out of one, and soon his fan was folded up and put in
the other. I therefore concluded that he was going to a dinner instead of a
review. The natives around me shaved the hair from the front half of their
heads and let it grow long behind: many of them did not shave their faces,
and others employed their leisure in diligently pulling the straggling hairs
down over their mouths. We arrange our toilets differently, thought I; but
could easily see the happy device of chopsticks, which enabled these gentlemen
to put their food into the mouth endwise under this natural fringe. A
group of hungry fellows, around the stall of a travelling cook, further exhibited
the utility of these <i>kwai-tsz’</i>, or ‘nimble lads’ (as I afterward learned
chopsticks were called), for each had put his bowl of rice to his lips, and was
shovelling in the contents till the mouth would hold no more. “We keep
our bowls on the table,” said I, “do our cooking in the house, and wait for
customers to come there instead of travelling around after them;” but these
chopsticks serve for knife, fork, and spoon in one.</p>

<p>On my way to the hotel I saw a group of old people and graybeards. A few
were chirruping and chuckling to larks or thrushes, which they carried perched
on a stick or in cages; others were catching flies or hunting for crickets to
feed them, while the remainder of the party seemed to be delightfully employed
in flying fantastic paper kites. A group of boys were gravely looking
on and regarding these innocent occupations of their seniors with the most
serious and gratified attention. A few of the most sprightly were kicking a
shuttlecock back and forth with great energy, instead of playing rounders
with bat and ball as boys would do.</p>

<p>As I had come to the country to reside for some time, I made inquiries respecting
a teacher, and happily found one who understood English. On entering
he stood at the door, and instead of coming forward and shaking my
hands, he politely bowed and shook his own, clasping them before his breast.
I looked upon this mode as an improvement on our custom, especially when
the condition of the hands might be doubtful, and requested him to be seated.
I knew that I was to study a language without an alphabet, but was not prepared
to see him begin at what I had always considered to be the end of the
book. He read the date of its publication, “the fifth year, tenth month, and
first day.” “We arrange our dates differently,” I observed, and begged him
to read&mdash;which he did, from top to bottom, and proceeding from right to left.
“You have an odd book here,” remarked I, taking it up; “what is the
price?” “A dollar and eight-thirds,” said he, upon which I counted out
three dollars and two-thirds and went on looking at it. The paper was
printed only on one side; the running title was on the edge of the leaves instead
of the top of the page, the paging was near the bottom, the number and
contents of the chapters were at their ends, the marginal notes on the top,
where the blank was double the size at the foot, and a broad black line across
the middle of each page, like that seen in some French newspapers, separated
the two works composing the volume, instead of one being printed after the
other. The back was open and the sewing outside, and the name neatly
written on the bottom edge. “You have given me too much,” said he, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[831]</a></span>
handed me back two dollars and one-third, and then explained that eight-thirds
meant eight divided by three, or only three-eighths. A small native
vocabulary which he carried with him had the characters arranged according
to the termination of their sounds, <i>ming</i>, <i>sing</i>, <i>king</i>, being all in a row,
and the first word in it being <i>seen</i>. “Ah! my friend,” said I, “English
won’t help me to find a word in that book; please give me your address.” He
accordingly took out a red card, big as a sheet of paper, on which was written
Ying San-yuen in large characters, and pointed out the place of his residence,
written on the other side. “I thought your name was Mr. Ying; why do
you write your name wrong end first?” “It is you who are in the wrong,”
replied he; “look in your yearly directory, where alone you write names as
they should be written, putting the honored family name first.”</p>

<p>I could only say, “Customs differ;” and begged him to speak of ceremony,
as I gave him back the book. He commenced, “When you receive a distinguished
guest, do not fail to place him on your left, for that is the seat of
honor; and be careful not to uncover the head, as that would be an unbecoming
act of familiarity.” This was a little opposed to my established notions;
but when he reopened the volume and read, “The most learned men are decidedly
of the opinion that the seat of the human understanding is in the
belly,” I cried out, “Better say it is in the feet!” and straightway shut up
the book, dismissing him for another day; for this shocked all my principles
of correct philosophy, even if King Solomon was against me.</p>

<p>On going abroad I met so many things contrary to my early notions of propriety
that I readily assented to a friend’s observation, that the Chinese were
our antipodes in many things besides geographical position. “Indeed,” said
I, “they are so; I shall expect shortly to see a man walking on his head.
Look! there’s a woman in trousers and a party of gentlemen in petticoats; she
is smoking and they are fanning themselves.” However, on passing them I
saw that the latter had on tight leggings. We soon met the steward of the
house dressed in white, and I asked him what merry-making he was invited
to; with a look of concern he told me he was returning from his father’s funeral.
Instead of having crape on his head he wore white shoes, and his
dress was slovenly and neglected. My companion informed me that in the
north of China it was common for rich people at funerals to put a white harness
on the mules and shroud the carts in coarse cotton; while the chief mourners
walked next to the bier, making loud cryings and showing their grief by
leaning on the attendants. The friends rode behind and the musicians preceded
the coffin&mdash;all being unlike our sable plumes and black crapes.</p>

<p>We next went through a retired street, where we heard sobbing and crying
inside a court, and I inquired who was dead or ill. The man, suppressing a
smile, said, “It is a girl about to be married, who is lamenting with her relatives
and fellows as she bids adieu to the family penates and lares and her
paternal home. She has enough to cry about, though, in the prospect of
going to her mother-in-law’s house.”</p>

<p>I thought, after these unlucky essays, I would ask no more questions, but
use my eyes instead. Looking into a shop, I saw a stout fellow sewing lace on
a bonnet for a foreign lady; and going on to the landing-place, behold, all
the ferry-boats were rowed by women, and from a passage-boat at the wharf I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[832]</a></span>
saw all the women get out of the bow to go ashore. “What are we coming to
next?” said I; and just then saw a carpenter take his foot-rule out of his
stocking to measure some timber which an apprentice was cutting with a saw
whose blade was set nearly at right angles with the frame. Before the door
sat a man busily engaged in whitening the thick soles of a pair of cloth shoes.
“That’s a shoewhite, I suppose,” said I; “and he answers to the shoeblacks
in New York, who cry ‘Shine! shine!’” “Just so,” said my friend; “and
beyond him see the poor wretch in <i>chokey</i>, with a board or cangue around his
neck for a shirt-collar; an article of his toilet which answers to the cuffs
with which the lads in the Tombs there are garnished instead of bracelets.
In the prisons in this land, instead of cropping the hair of a criminal, as with
us, no man is allowed to have his head shaved.”</p>

<p>In the alleys called streets, few of them ten feet wide, the signs stood on
their ends or hung from the eaves; the counters of the shops were next the
street, the fronts were all open, and I saw the holes for the upright bars
which secured the shop at night. Everything was done or sold in the streets
or markets, which presented a strange medley. The hogs were transported in
hampers on the shoulders of coolies, to the evident satisfaction of the inmates,
and small pigs were put into baskets carried in slings, while the fish were
frisking and jumping in shallow tubs as they were hawked from door to door.</p>

<p>A loud din led us to look in at an open door to see what was going on, and
there a dozen boys were learning their tasks, all crying like auctioneers; one
lad reciting his lesson out of Confucius turned his back to the master instead of
looking him in the face, and another who was learning to write put the copy-slip
under the paper to imitate it, instead of looking at it as our boys would
do.</p>

<p>We next passed a fashionable lady stepping out of her sedan chair. Her
head was adorned with flowers instead of a bonnet, her hands gloveless, and
her neck quite bare. Her feet were encased in red silk pictured shoes not
quite four inches long; her plaited, embroidered petticoat was a foot longer
than her gown, and her waist was not to be seen. As she entered the court-yard,
leaning on the shoulder of her maid to help her walk on those cramped
feet, my friend observed, “There you see a good example of a live walking-stick.”</p>

<p>A little after we met one of his acquaintances accompanying a prettily carved
coffin, and he asked who was dead.</p>

<p>“No man hab catchee die,” replied the Celestial; “this one piecy coffin I
just now gib my olo fader. He likee too much counta my numba one ploper;
s’pose he someteem catchee die, can usee he.”</p>

<p>“So fashion, eh?” rejoined my friend; “how muchee plice can catchee
one alla same same for that?”</p>

<p>“I tinky can get one alla same so fashion one tousan dollar, so; this hab
first chop hansom, lo.”</p>

<p>“Do you call that gibberish English or Chinese?” I asked; for the language
sounded no less strange than the custom of presenting a coffin to a living
father differed from my preconceived notions of filial duty.</p>

<p>“That’s the purest pigeon-English,” replied he; “and you must be the
Jack Downing of Canton to immortalize it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">[833]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">COMMENDABLE TRAITS OF CHINESE CHARACTER.</div>

<p>In summing up the moral traits of Chinese character&mdash;a far
more difficult task than the enumeration of its oddities&mdash;we must
necessarily compare them with that perfect standard given us
from above. While their contrarieties indicate a different external
civilization, a slight acquaintance with their morals proves
their similarity to their fellow-men in the lineaments of a fallen
and depraved nature. Some of the better traits of their character
have been marvellously developed. They have attained, by
the observance of peace and good order, to a high degree of
security for life and property; the various classes of society are
linked together in a remarkably homogeneous manner by the
diffusion of education in the most moral books in their language
and a general regard for the legal rights of property. Equality
of competition for office removes the main incentive to violence
in order to obtain posts of power and dignity, and industry receives
its just reward of food, raiment, and shelter with a uniformity
which encourages its constant exertion. If any one
asks how they have reached this point, we would primarily ascribe
it to the blessing of the Governor of the nations, who has for
His own purposes continued one people down to the present time
from remote antiquity. The roots of society among them have
never been broken up by emigration or the overflowing conquest
of a superior race, but have been fully settled in a great
regard for the family compact and deep reverence for parents
and superiors. Education has strengthened and disseminated
the morality they had, and God has blessed their filial piety by
fulfilling the first commandment with promise and making their
days long in the land which He has given them. Davis lays
rather too much stress upon geographical and climatic causes in
accounting for their advancement in these particulars, though
their isolation has no doubt had much to do with their security
and progress.</p>

<p>When, however, these traits have been mentioned, the Chinese
are still more left without excuse for their wickedness, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">[834]</a></span>
being without law, they are a law unto themselves; they have
always known better than they have done. With a general regard
for outward decency, they are vile and polluted in a shocking
degree; their conversation is full of filthy expressions and
their lives of impure acts. They are somewhat restrained in
the latter by the fences put around the family circle, so that
seduction and adultery are comparatively infrequent, the former
may even be said to be rare; but brothels and their inmates
occur everywhere on land and on water. One danger attending
young girls going abroad alone is that they will be stolen for
incarceration in these gates of hell. By pictures, songs, and
aphrodisiacs they excite their sensuality, and, as the Apostle
says, “receive in themselves that recompense of their error
which is meet.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MENDACITY OF THE CHINESE.</div>

<p>More uneradicable than the sins of the flesh is the falsity of
the Chinese, and its attendant sin of base ingratitude; their disregard
of truth has perhaps done more to lower their character
than any other fault. They feel no shame at being detected in
a lie (though they have not gone quite so far as not to know
when they do lie), nor do they fear any punishment from their
gods for it. On the other hand, the necessity of the case compels
them, in their daily intercourse with each other, to pay
some regard to truth, and each man, from his own consciousness,
knows just about how much to expect. Ambassadors and merchants
have not been in the best position to ascertain their real
character in this respect; for on the one side the courtiers of
Peking thought themselves called upon by the mere presence of
an embassy to put on some fictitious appearances, and on the
other, the integrity and fair dealing of the hong merchants and
great traders at Canton is in advance of the usual mercantile
honesty of their countrymen. A Chinese requires but little
motive to falsify, and he is constantly sharpening his wits to
cozen his customer&mdash;wheedle him by promises and cheat him in
goods or work. There is nothing which tries one so much when
living among them as their disregard of truth, and renders him
so indifferent as to what calamities may befall so mendacious a
race; an abiding impression of suspicion toward everybody
rests upon the mind, which chills the warmest wishes for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[835]</a></span>
welfare and thwarts many a plan to benefit them. Their better
traits diminish in the distance, and patience is exhausted in
its daily proximity and friction with this ancestor of all sins.
Mr. Abeel mentions a case of deceit which may serve as a
specimen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Soon after we arrived at Kulang su, a man came to us who professed to be
the near relation and guardian of the owners of the house in which we live,
and presented a little boy as the joint proprietor with his widowed mother.
From the appearance of the house and the testimony of others we could easily
credit his story that the family were now in reduced circumstances, having not
only lost the house when the English attacked the place, but a thousand dollars
besides by native robbers; we therefore allowed him a small rent, and
gave the dollars to the man, who put them into the hands of the child. The
next month he made his appearance, but our servant, whom we had taken to
be peculiarly honest for a heathen, suggested the propriety of inquiring whether
the money was ever given to those for whom it was professedly received; and
soon returned with the information that the mother had heard nothing of
the money, the man who received it not living in the family, but had now
sent a lad to us who would receive it for her, and who our servants assured us
would give it to the proper person. A day or two afterward our cook whispered
to me that our <em>honest</em> servant, who had taken so much pains to prevent
all fraud in the matter, had made the lad give him one-half of the money for
his disinterestedness in preventing it from falling into improper hands; and
further examination showed us that this very cook had himself received a good
share to keep silent.</p></div>

<p>Thieving is exceedingly common, and the illegal exactions of
the rulers, as has already been sufficiently pointed out, are most
burdensome. This vice, too, is somewhat restrained by the
punishments inflicted on criminals, though the root of the evil
is not touched. While the licentiousness of the Chinese may be
in part ascribed to their ignorance of pure intellectual pleasures
and the want of virtuous female society, so may their lying be
attributed partly to their truckling fear of officers, and their
thievery to the want of sufficient food or work. Hospitality is
not a trait of their character; on the contrary, the number and
wretched condition of the beggars show that public and private
charity is almost extinct; yet here too the sweeping charge
must be modified when we remember the efforts they make to
sustain their relatives and families in so densely peopled a country.
Their avarice is not so distinguishing a feature as their love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">[836]</a></span>
of money, but the industry which this desire induces or presupposes
is the source of most of their superiority to their neighbors.
The politeness which they exhibit seldom has its motive in good-will,
and consequently, when the varnish is off, the rudeness,
brutality, and coarseness of the material is seen; still, among
themselves this exterior polish is not without some good results
in preventing quarrels, where both parties, fully understanding
each other, are careful not to overpass the bounds of etiquette.</p>

<p>On the whole, the Chinese present a singular mixture: if
there is something to commend, there is more to blame; if they
have some glaring vices, they have more virtues than most
pagan nations. Ostentatious kindness and inbred suspicion,
ceremonious civility and real rudeness, partial invention and
servile imitation, industry and waste, sycophancy and self-dependence,
are, with other dark and bright qualities, strangely
blended. In trying to remedy the faults of their character by
the restraints of law and the diffusion of education, they have
no doubt hit upon the right mode; and their shortcomings show
how ineffectual both must be until the Gospel comes to the aid
of ruler and subject in elevating the moral sense of the whole
nation. Female infanticide in some parts openly confessed, and
divested of all disgrace and penalties everywhere; the dreadful
prevalence of all the vices charged by the Apostle Paul upon the
ancient heathen world; the alarming extent of the use of opium
(furnished, too, under the patronage, and supplied in purity by
the power and skill of Great Britain from India), destroying
the productions and natural resources of the people; the universal
practice of lying and dishonest dealings; the unblushing
lewdness of old and young; harsh cruelty toward prisoners by
officers, and tyranny over slaves by masters&mdash;all form a full unchecked
torrent of human depravity, and prove the existence of
a kind and degree of moral degradation of which an excessive
statement can scarcely be made, or an adequate conception
hardly be formed.</p>

Manuscript Tartare</cite>; Leyde: 1726), gives another derivation for these two
names. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alänzä-chan eut deux fils jumeaux l’un appelle Tatar and l’autre
Mogull ou pour bien dire Mung’l, entre les quels il partagea ses Estates lorsqu’il
se vit sur la fin de sa vie.</span>” It is the first prince, he adds, from whom
came the name <i>Tartar</i>&mdash;not from a river called Tata, as some have stated&mdash;while
of the second: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le terme Mung’l a esté changé par une corruption generale
en Mogull; <i>Mung veut dire triste ou un homme triste</i>, et parceque ce
prince estoit naturellement d’une humeur fort triste, il porta ce nom dans la
verité</span>”&mdash;(pp. 27-29). But Visdelon (D’Herbelot, ed. 1778, Tome IV., p. 327)
shows more acquaintance with their history in producing proofs that the name
<i>Tatar</i> was applied in the eighth century by the Chinese to certain tribes living
north of the Ín shan, Ala shan, and River Liau. In the dissensions following
upon the ruin of the Tang dynasty, some of them migrated eastwards beyond
the Songari, and there in time rallied to subdue the northern provinces,
under the name of <i>Nu-chih</i>. These are the ancestors of the Manchus. Another
fraction went north to the marshy banks of Lakes Hurun and Puyur,
where they received the name of <i>Moungul Tahtsz’</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, Marsh Tatars. This
tribe and name it was that the warlike Genghis afterwards made conspicuous.
The sound <i>Mogul</i> used in India is a dialectal variation.</p></div>

boundaries between Ílí and Russian territory in the following sections:
</p>
<p>
Art. VII. A tract of country in the west of Ílí is ceded to Russia, where
those who go over to Russia and are thereby dispossessed of their land in Ílí
may settle. The boundary line of Chinese Ílí and Russian territory will stretch
from the Pieh-chên-tao [Bedschin-tau] Mountains along the course of the Ho-êrh-kwo-ssü
[Yehorsos] River, to its junction with the Ílí River, thence across
the Ílí River, and south to the east of the village of Kwo-li-cha-tê [Kaldschat]
on the Wu-tsung-tau range, and from this point south along the old boundary
line fixed by the agreement of Ta-Chêng [Tashkend] in the year 1864.
</p>
<p>
Art. VIII. The boundary line to the east of the Chi-sang lake, fixed in
the year 1864 by the agreement of Ta-Chêng [Tashkend], having proved unsatisfactory,
high officers will be specially deputed by both countries jointly to
examine and alter it so that a satisfactory result may be attained. That there
may be no doubt what part of the Khassak country belongs to China and what
to Russia, the boundary will consist of a straight line drawn from the Kwei
Tung Mountains across the Hei-i-êrh-te-shih River to the Sa-wu-êrh range, and
the high officers deputed to settle the boundary will fix the new boundary
along such straight line which is within the old boundary.
</p>
<p>
Art. IX. As to the boundary on the west, between the Province of Fei-êrh-kan
[Ferghana], which is subject to Russia, and Chinese Kashgar, officials will
be deputed by both countries to examine it, and they will fix the boundary
line between the territories at present actually under the jurisdiction of either
country, and they will erect boundary stones thereon.</p></div>

the Kuldja frontier, has always been a matter of doubt and discussion among
geologists and Russian explorers. The Governor of Semiretchinsk, General
Kolpakofsky, was, in 1881, able to report the discovery of the perpetual fires
in the Tien shan range of mountains. The mountain Bai shan was found
twelve miles northeast of Kuldja, in a basin surrounded by the massive Ailak
mountains; its fires are not volcanic, but proceed from burning coal. On the
sides of the mountain there are caves emitting smoke and sulphurous gas.
Mr. Schuyler, in his <cite>Turkistan</cite>, mentions that these perpetual fires in the
mountains, referred to by Chinese historians, were considered by Severtzoff, a
Russian, who explored the region, as being caused by the ignition of the seams
of coal, or the carburetted hydrogen gas in the seams. The same author
further mentions that Captain Tosnofskey, another Russian explorer, was told
of a place in the neighborhood from which steam constantly rose, and that
near this crevice there had existed, from ancient times, three pits, where persons
afflicted with rheumatism or skin diseases were in the habit of bathing.</p></div>

which the early Persian monarchs, Darius, Xerxes, and others, were called,
were really titles or surnames, and not their own personal names, suggests the
further comparison whether those renowned names were not like the <i>kwoh
hao</i> of the Chinese emperors, whose adoption of the custom was after the extinction
of the Persian monarchy. Herodotus (Book VI., 98) seems to have
been familiar with these names, not so much as being arbitrary and meaningless
terms as epithets whose significations were associated with the kings. The
new names given to the last two sons of Josiah, who became kings of Judah
by their conquerors (2 Kings, 23: 34, and 24: 17), indicate even an earlier adoption
of this custom.</p></div>

between the Chinese and primitive Accadian population of Chaldea,
says in a letter to the London <cite>Times</cite>: “I would mention one fact which may
certainly be considered to favor it. The cuneiform characters of Babylonia
and Assyria are, as is well known, degenerated hieroglyphics, like the modern
Chinese characters. The original hieroglyphics were invented by the Accadians
before they descended into Babylonia from the mountains of Elam, and
I have long been convinced that they were originally written in vertical columns.
In no other way can I explain the fact that most of the pictures to
which the cuneiform characters can be traced back stand upon their sides.
There is evidence to show that the inventors of the hieroglyphics used papyrus,
or some similar vegetable substance, for writing purposes before the alluvial
plain of Babylonia furnished them with clay, and the use of such a
writing material will easily account for the vertical direction in which the
characters were made to run.”</p></div>

a part of the name, but are titles, meaning <i>rabbi</i> or <i>eminent teacher</i>, and are
added to the surnames of some of the most distinguished writers, by way of
peculiar distinction; and in the words Mencius and Confucius have been
Latinized with Măng and Kung, names of the persons themselves, into one
word. The names of other distinguished scholars, as Chu fu-tsz’, Ching fu-tsz’,
etc., have not undergone this change into Chufucius, Chingfucius; but usage
has now brought the compellation for these two men into universal use as a
distinctive title, somewhat like the term <i>venerable</i> applied to Bede.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2>START: FULL LICENSE<br />
<br />
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
